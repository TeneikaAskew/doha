Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nHistory of Case\nOn January 31, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The\naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD) 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n03/22/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 10, 2018, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on January 9, 2019, and was scheduled for hearing on\nFebruary 14, 2019. A hearing was convened as scheduled, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no \nexhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 26, 2019.\n     \nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with an updated psychological\nevaluation. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to supplement the\nrecord. Department Counsel was afforded two days to respond. Within the time\npermitted, Applicant submitted an email explanation from his facility security officer\n(FSO) of her understanding of Applicant\u2019s mental health condition, while crediting him\nwith being a true patriot. Applicant\u2019s submission was admitted as AE A without\nobjection.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline I, Applicant allegedly (a) was diagnosed with Bipolar Affective\nDisorder in about February 2010 and failed to follow his prescribed treatment plan by\ndiscontinuing a prescribed medication and (b) was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder,\nsevere, with anxious distress, with mood-congruent psychotic features, in full remission,\nin about January 2018, and with a prognosis considered to be guarded due to a lack of\npersonal insight into his symptoms and his non-compliance with his primary care\nphysician\u2019s recommendation that he reestablish care with a psychiatrist.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\n1.a, but denied the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b. He claimed to have discontinued\nhis treatment in 2010 for two reasons: The medication was making him uncomfortable\nand he lacked confidence in his provider. He claimed that he found another provider,\nwith the help of his primary provider, whom he was closer to and better connected with,\nwho prescribed more soothing medication. He further claimed that this second doctor\nlater shut down his practice due to a lawsuit. \nApplicant claimed in his response that he went back to his primary provider for\nguidance in finding a new psychiatrist, and that he found a new psychiatrist who treated\nhim for one session before moving on. He claimed that he has a new provider\nscheduled that he is scheduled to see in July 2018.\nApplicant acknowledged having some physical ailments from sports, coaching,\nindustry, and construction, and sometimes suffers from lower back pain in the L-5 area.\nHe claimed that when he would cease using prescribed medication for his Bipolar\ndisorder, his nerve inflation would subside. And he claimed that he experienced\ndifficulties connecting with his provider and convincing him of his reported experiences\n2\n\nwith his medications. Applicant reported in his response hat he suffered frm Guillen-\nBarre Syndrome in 1984 that affected his ability to physically function.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 63-year-old janitor floor specialist who seeks a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted allegations are adopted as relevant and material findings. \nAdditional findings follow.\nBackground\nAppellant married in August 1980 and has two adult children from this marriage.\n(GE 1) He attended an accredited college between 1974 and 1978, but did not earn a\ndiploma. While an undergraduate student, he played varsity baseball. Applicant\nreported no military service. \nSince July 2008, Applicant has worked for his current employer. (GE 1) Between\nMarch 2000 and December 2000, he  worked for other employers. He has worked\ncontemporaneously for another employer since May 2011 as an inventory control\nspecialist, and between July 2008 and January 2011, he was self-employed. (GE 1)\nApplicant\u2019s mental health history  \nApplicant presents with a lengthy history of mental health issues. (GEs 2-3) In\nFebruary 2010, he was referred to a mental health provider to assess his mental health\nsymptoms. (GE 2; Tr. 54) After taking personal information from Applicant, Dr. A (a\nlicensed psychiatrist) entered an uncertain diagnosis, but suspected Bipolar Affective\nDisorder. (GE 2) At this time, Dr. A offered Applicant a trial of anti-psychotic medications\n(Lamictol and Lithium in various doses) and scheduled him for a return visit in March\n2010. (GE 2) Dr. A\u2019s notes document that Applicant consulted with him on five\noccasions between February 2010 and April 2011. (GEs 2-3) While Applicant did not\nsee Dr. A after his last visit in April 2011, he continued to take his prescribed\nmedications for several months thereafter before he ceased altogether. (GEs 2-3; Tr.\n32-34) \nWith the help of his primary medical provider, Applicant engaged another mental\nhealth provider, who he was closer to and better connected with. Between Fall 2013\nand January 2015, Applicant consulted with Dr. B (a licensed psychiatrist) on several\noccasions during this time frame. Dr. B prescribed a different medication: Depakote\n(100 mg). (GEs 2-3; Tr. 33-34, 61-62) He ceased seeing Dr. B after learning that Dr. B\nretired after being sued by a patient and losing his license in 2015. (GE 2; Tr. 62)\nThroughout most of 2015, Applicant continued to take his prescribed Depakote\nintermittently with the advice of another recommended mental health provider (Dr. C),\nwhom Applicant consulted with on only one occasion in 2018.  (Tr. 66) For over two\nyears (2016-2018) Applicant did not consult with a mental health provider or take his\nprescribed Depakote or any other medications designed to address any experienced\nBipolar symptoms on more than an intermittent basis. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 62-63, 66-67)  Only\n3\n\nthrough the influence of his daughter did Applicant return to his medications\nintermittently. (Tr. 63-64)\nIn January 2018, Applicant was referred by the DOD CAF to Dr. D (a licensed\npsychiatrist) for a mental health evaluation. (GE 3) After taking psychiatric history from\nApplicant, Dr. D conducted a mental health examination of him. (GE 3) Results of Dr.\nD\u2019s personality assessment revealed that Applicant answered the questions in a\nmanner where he was trying to portray himself in a positive light that was extreme, even\nfor the evaluative nature of the interview. (GE 3; Tr. 38-39, 62-63) According to Dr. D\u2019s\nobservations, Applicant minimized and denied common shortcomings or minor faults in\na way that likely indicated he was in denial of these issues with little awareness of the\nnegative impact that his actions had on himself or others. (GE 3) Because of Applicant\u2019s\nabnormally high level of minimizing and the defensive nature of his responses, Dr. D\ncould not reliably extrapolate from his assessment any further details. (GE 3)\nBased on his observations of Applicant, Dr. D ruled out Applicant experiencing \nany symptoms of mania. (GE 3) He did, however, draw historical diagnostic impressions\nof Applicant\u2019s experiencing manic episodes, amid reported concerns from Applicant\u2019s\ndaughter about Applicant\u2019s disposition to decompensate quickly if he misses a\nmedication dosage or is non-compliant with his medication regimen. (GE 3) Based on\nhis  diagnostic impressions of Applicant, Dr. D diagnosed him with Bipolar I Disorder,\nsevere, with anxious distress, with mood-congruent psychotic features, in full remission. \n(GE 3)\nDr. D, in turn, assigned a prognosis of Applicant that the latter\u2019s viability to hold a\nsecurity clearance is dependent on his ability to be fully compliant and stable on an\neffective medication regimen. (GE 3) Based on Dr. D\u2019s review and understanding of the\navailable medical documentation, collateral information gained, and Applicant\u2019s own\nadmission, it was clear to Dr. D that Applicant did not fully grasp the consequences of\nhis previous episodes and that his compliance is due to family pressure rather than\npersonal insight, awareness building, and a desire to prevent further episodes or the\nconsequences that they cause. (GE 3) \nDr. D Is on record in expressing particular concern about Applicant\u2019s past\nunwillingness to promptly follow up on his primary care provider\u2019s recommendation to\nreconnect with a psychiatrist, which, in Dr. D\u2019s judgment, calls into question his\ncommitment to the treatment plan. Noting few safeguards in place to guarantee or\naccurately predict whether Applicant\u2019s current stability is sustainable, Dr. D determined\nthat Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to safeguard or handle\nclassified information is promising, but only if he is compliant with his medications. (GE\n3) \nSince his submitting to a psychological evaluation in January 2018, it remains to\nbe seen how Applicant has complied with his medication regimen. The information he\nprovided at his hearing is very limited and includes no documented notes or records of\nwhat medications he is currently taking and in what doses. While Applicant has engaged\nanother psychiatrist (Dr. C) in July 2018 to help him manage his medications, to date,\n4\n\nhe has seen this mental health provider only once and has not provided any evidence of\na diagnosis, prescribed medications, or prognosis from Dr. C. that could help to assess\nApplicant\u2019s current condition and adherence to his prescribed medications. In the\nmeantime, Applicant continues to self-medicate with Depakote. (Tr. 47-48)\nCharacter references\nApplicant is well-regarded by his facility security officer (FSO) who considers him\na true patriot. (AE A) She expressed awareness of Applicant\u2019s medical condition and, in\nparticular, two episodes she knows of where he \u201cbecame a little unbalanced and both\ntimes he was put on short term disability by his doctor.\u201d (AE A) His FSO acknowledged\nthat had she known what she knows now, she probably would not have wanted to take\nthe risk and put him in for a security clearance. (AE A) No other character references\nwere furnished by Applicant.\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of\nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns. These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n5\n\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  And because all security clearances must be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the\nApplicant.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein\n     \nPsychological Conditions\nThe Concern. Certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can\nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a\ndisorder is not required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A\nduly qualified mental health professional (e.g., a clinical psychologist or\npsychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S.\nGovernment, should be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying\nand mitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including\nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the\nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental\nhealth counseling.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). As with all\nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n6\n\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  Because all security clearances must be clearly consistent\nwith the national interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the Applicant.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a civilian janitor floor specialist who seeks a security clearance. \nSecurity concerns are raised over his past history of diagnosed Bipolar Affective\nDisorder in 2010 and Bipolar 1 Disorder with anxious distress with mood-congruent\npsychotic features in 2018.\nPsychological condition concerns\nSince 2010, Applicant has undergone several mental health evaluation for\nBipolar-related issues with licensed mental health providers: three self-referred (Drs. A-\nB and D), and one directed by Applicant\u2019s command (Dr. C). Applicant\u2019s evaluators all\nreached similar conclusions with their respective diagnoses and prognoses and are\nfully reconcilable. All three psychiatric evaluators found indicia of Bipolar traits of\nlongstanding duration in their assessments of Applicant.\nIn their coverage of Applicant\u2019s background history, Drs. A-B and D found \nevidence of a defect in judgment and reliability in Appellant\u2019s case history without \nconsidering him unsuitable for holding a security clearance, providing he complied with\nhis medication regimens prescribed by his treating mental health providers. See DSM-\nV. For obvious reasons, any loss of mental grasp and judgment in times of stress\nplaces the affected person at some risk to overreactions to stimuli and consequential\nmisjudgments and cannot be discounted. \nFor Applicant, his potential for relapse of symptoms (e.g., mood swings)\nassociated with his Bipolar Disorder with attendant risks of judgment lapses (even if not\nsufficiently developed along any of the DSM-5 classification categories to warrant\nclearly identifiable and calibrated stressors) can create hypothetical potential in the\nopinion of his evaluators for exposing him to security risks to inadvertently compromise\nclassified materials in his custody or control, consistent with the requirements of the\nDSM-V. Based on the recent assessments of Drs. A-C, two disqualifying conditions\ncovered by the psychological conditions guideline are applicable to Appellant\u2019s\nsituation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may\nindicate an emotional, mental, or personalty condition, including, but not limited to,\nirresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic,\nlying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors\u201d:  28(b), \u201can opinion by a duly qualified\n7\n\nmental health professional that the individual has a condition that may impair judgment,\nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d\nBased on the reconciled assessments of Applicant\u2019s recent evaluators (Drs. A-\nC), Applicant may claim some benefits of one of the potentially available mitigating\nconditions covered by Guideline. MC \u00b6 29(b), \u201cthe individual has voluntarily entered a\ncounseling or treatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the\nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a\nduly qualified mental health professional,\u201d is partially applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nWithout more evidence of follow-up treatment and counseling to ensure\nApplicant\u2019s compliance with the medication regimens prescribed for him by Dr. B, and\npossibly Dr. D, full application of any of the potentially available mitigating conditions is\nreserved pending updates of his mental health evaluations. To date, Applicant has not\nprovided any evaluation updates from Dr. D or any other licensed psychiatrist. Nor has\nhe provided probative reassurances of his continued compliance with prescribed\nmedication regimens. Without confirmation of Applicant\u2019s continuing compliance with\nhis prescribed medication regimen, safe predictions cannot be made about his ability to\nwithstand recurrent Bipolar symptoms that can adversely affect his judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness.  \nWhole-person assessment\nBased on a whole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s current judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness, taking into account all of Applicant\u2019s developed personal\nhistories, diagnostic impressions reach by his professional evaluators, diagnoses,\nassessments, and prognoses compiled by the mental health professionals who\nevaluated Applicant, Applicant cannot be reliably predicted at this time to be able to\nsustain the medication compliance that is required to maintain his diagnosed Bipolar\ncondition in remission. \nApplicant is well regarded by his FSO who characterized him as a true patriot.\nBut despite the high praise she extended to him, she could not state with conviction\nthat his current condition could not affect his judgment reliability, and trustworthiness.\nPsychological condition concerns are not mitigated.\nFormal Findings\n   \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE I (PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:\n              Against Applicant\n8\n\nConclusions\n        In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2000, and took additional college courses from January 2003 until November 2005. He did not receive an additional degree. He married the first time in 1980, had one child, and divorced in 1985. He married again in 1985 and had four children. Applicant and his wife separated briefly a number of times in their marriage and now have been separated since 2015. Applicant and his wife are trying to reconcile. He has four adult children from this marriage. Since separating from his wife, Applicant rented the basement of a town house where he and his special needs son reside. (Tr. 25-26, 35-38) Applicant served on active duty in the Army from March 1975 until April 1995. He retired as a First Sergeant (E-8) with an honorable discharge. After leaving active duty, he served as a minister for three years until approximately 2000. In February 2002, he started working with his present defense contractor employer as a mechanic. He was continually promoted and has been a production supervisor for the last ten years. Applicant\u2019s employer has been very supportive of him while he undergoes substance abuse rehabilitation, to care for his son, and the need to care for and bury his mother.

Davis, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not provide sufficient documentary evidence to mitigate all financial, \nalcohol, and criminal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 18, 2016 (Government Exhibit (GX) 1), and March 29, 2012 (GX 3), to \nobtain a security clearance required for a position with a defense contractor. He was \ngranted access to classified information after submission of the 2012 e-QIP. However, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the affirmative findings required to \ncontinue his eligibility for access to classified information after he submitted his 2016 e-\nQIP. On June 28, 2017, DOD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns for alcohol consumption (Guideline G), criminal conduct (Guideline J), \nand financial considerations (Guideline F). DOD amended the SOR on October 17, \n2017, to more clearly outline the allegations under Guidelines G and J. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n12/17/2018\n\n2 \n \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the Department of \nDefense on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the original SOR on July 19, 2017. He admitted the four \nfinancial allegations under Guideline F. He answered the amended SOR on October 25, \n2018, admitting the two allegations of alcohol consumption under Guideline G and the \none allegation of criminal conduct under Guideline J. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on the original allegations on October 23, 2017, and the case was \nassigned to me April 13, 2018. DOD issued a notice of hearing on September 4, 2018, \nfor a hearing on September 19, 2018. Unfortunately, Applicant\u2019s mother passed away \non the day of the hearing. A new notice of hearing was issued on September 19, 2018, \nfor a hearing on November 1, 2018. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. \nDepartment Counsel introduced 17 documents which were admitted into the record \nwithout objection as Government Exhibits (GX) 1 to 17. Applicant introduced five \ndocuments admitted into the record without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AX) A to E. I \nkept the record open for Applicant to introduce additional documents. Applicant timely \nsubmitted six documents that I admitted without objection as AX F to K. (GX 18, e-mail, \ndated December 3, 2018) DOHA received a copy of the hearing transcript on November \n9, 2018. The record closed on December 3, 2018, upon receipt of all post-hearing \ndocuments.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 62 years old. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2000, and took \nadditional college courses from January 2003 until November 2005. He did not receive \nan additional degree. He married the first time in 1980, had one child, and divorced in \n1985. He married again in 1985 and had four children. Applicant and his wife separated \nbriefly a number of times in their marriage and now have been separated since 2015. \nApplicant and his wife are trying to reconcile. He has four adult children from this \nmarriage. Since separating from his wife, Applicant rented the basement of a town \nhouse where he and his special needs son reside. (Tr. 25-26, 35-38) \n \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the Army from March 1975 until April 1995. He \nretired as a First Sergeant (E-8) with an honorable discharge. After leaving active duty, \nhe served as a minister for three years until approximately 2000. In February 2002, he \nstarted working with his present defense contractor employer as a mechanic. He was \ncontinually promoted and has been a production supervisor for the last ten years. \nApplicant\u2019s employer has been very supportive of him while he undergoes substance \nabuse rehabilitation, to care for his son, and the need to care for and bury his mother. \n(Tr. 26-27; 33-36; GX 1, e-QIP, dated June 18, 2016; GX 3, e-QIP, dated March 29, \n2012) \n \nThe SOR alleges four financial security concerns under Guideline F; a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy filed in November 2016 with debts discharged in March 2017 (SOR 1.a); a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy filed in July 2016 but dismissed in December 2016 (SOR 1.b); \n\n3 \n \nfederal income tax debt of approximately $45,773 for tax years 2009, and 2011 to 2015 \n(SOR 1.c); and a failure to file in a timely fashion federal tax returns for tax years 2009 \nthrough 2015 (SOR 1.d). Delinquent student loans are not alleged in the SOR as \nfinancial security concerns but are noted on credit reports (GX 4, dated May 9, 2017; \nGX 5, dated August 19, 2016; GX 6, dated September 2, 2014; and GX 7, dated April 3, \n2012). \n \nThe SOR alleges under alcohol consumption (Guideline G) that Applicant in \nOctober 2011 discharged a firearm from a moving vehicle after consuming alcohol. He \nwas sentenced to be incarcerated for 180 days with 165 days suspended. (SOR 2.a). \nThe SOR also alleges that after consuming alcohol Applicant was arrested for \nrecklessly handling a firearm, swearing in public and public intoxication. He was \nsentenced to probation for 12 months. (SOR 2.b) These offenses were also cross-\nalleged as criminal conduct. (SOR 3.a) Applicant admitted all allegations. (Answer to \nSOR, dated October 25, 2018) \n \nApplicant lived beyond his means while on active duty. He used credit cards sent \nto him in the mail to bolster his ability to purchase whatever he wanted. After leaving \nactive duty in 1995 and working as a minister, Applicant continued to have financial \nproblems caused by lack of sufficient income and living beyond his means. In 1997, \nApplicant and his second wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in an attempt to save their \nhouse. They were unable to make the required payments to the bankruptcy trustee, so \nthe bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their debts at the time were \ndischarged in the bankruptcy in 1997. His house was foreclosed in 2002. (Tr. 20-21, 35-\n37; GX 8 and 9, Bankruptcy Documents, 1997; GX 10, Foreclosure documents, dated \nMay 3, 2002; GX 11, Applicant\u2019s Statement, dated May 16, 2002) \n \nApplicant and his wife continued to have financial issues. They moved so he \ncould have a better job, but his wife could not find employment to provide sufficient \nincome for the family. He could not afford to buy a house so he rented one. Applicant\u2019s \nwife usually calculated, completed, and filed their tax returns. After a separation in \napproximately 2006 from his wife, Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns for \nsix years from approximately 2009 until 2015 because he knew he would owe about \n$6,000 each year in taxes that he could not afford to pay. His wife continued to file \nseparately. Starting in 2008, Applicant knew he would owe substantial federal taxes. He \nwas overwhelmed by his problems and did not focus on what he needed to do and did \nnot take care of his business. (Tr. 40-41, 73-75) \n \nIn 2012, Applicant went to a tax service and an attorney to resolve his taxes to no \navail. Starting in 2012, Applicant\u2019s pay was garnished by the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS). After the IRS pay garnishment, Applicant\u2019s take-home pay was reduced to \napproximately $600 a month after garnishment. Applicant\u2019s car was repossessed, and \nhe and his family were evicted from the home they rented. Applicant and his wife \nseparated permanently in 2015. In 2016, Applicant was able to have a tax preparer file \nhis past-due tax returns. Applicant has continued to use this attorney to file his taxes. \n(Tr. 41-43) \n\n4 \n \nApplicant also contacted an attorney, and Applicant and his wife filed another \nChapter 13 bankruptcy that was later converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their debts \nwere again discharged in 2017. (Tr. 21-23, 43-45; GX 2, Bankruptcy Documents)   \n \nApplicant was overwhelmed by his financial issues and the need to care for his \nspecial needs son. After the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant worked with a Certified \nPublic Accountant (CPA) to resolve the federal tax debt that remained from the \nbankruptcy discharge. With the help of the CPA, Applicant was able to have his \ndisabled son declared his dependent and his income restructured to minimize his tax \nliability. Instead of owing taxes, he received a tax refund that is applied to his tax debt. \nHis mother, who was located in another state, became sick and Applicant had to travel \nto help care for her. His mother passed away in September 2018. (Tr. 23-25, 35-38) \n \nApplicant filed his past-due federal tax returns in 2016. (AX F, G, and H, IRS Tax \nDocuments). He timely filed his 2016 and 2017 federal tax returns. (AX I and J, IRS Tax \nDocuments) After all of the tax returns were filed, the IRS determined that Applicant \nowed approximately $35,000 in back taxes. In April 2018, Applicant agreed to a \npayment plan of $425 a month with the ISR to pay back taxes. His payment amount will \nincrease in April 2019 to $595. No taxes were owed for tax years 2016 and 2017. He is \ncurrent with the IRS payment plan for past-due taxes for tax years 2010 to 2015. (Tr. \n49-52, 72-74) \n \nApplicant drank alcohol from approximately 1990 to 2000. He started drinking \nbecause he was a young soldier and just wanted to drink alcohol. He stopped drinking \nalcohol in 2000 because he entered the ministry becoming a pastor and did not want to \nbe seen consuming alcohol. He started drinking again in 2003 because he left the \nministry and there was no accountability for behavior, he was still having financial \nproblems, and he had lost his home. In 2010, his consumption of alcohol increased \nsubstantially for no reason except he and his wife were separated; his children had \nmoved back into his house; and he had issues caring for his mother who was in another \nstate. He was consuming from six to nine beers a day. He drank to deal with his \nproblems and his stress. Applicant sought substance abuse counseling. In 2015, he \nstarted to consult with a psychologist who he still periodically sees.  He last consumed \nalcohol on September 22, 2018, the day before his mother\u2019s funeral. The day before the \nhearing, he started a Veteran\u2019s Affairs (VA) Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program \n(SARP) through his employer. He understands he has an issue with alcohol and needs \ntreatment. He stated that he does not intend to consume alcohol in the future. (Tr. 51-\n58, 75-78: AX A through D; VA Hospital staff assignments and schedule) \n \nIn October 2011, Applicant was separated from his wife and dating another \nwoman. He was consuming a few beers before the woman asked him to take her and \nher young daughter to run some errands. Since he had been drinking alcohol, he asked \nthe woman to drive. Applicant brought a handgun with him because the jurisdiction \nwhere they were located allowed the open carrying of handguns. Applicant and the \nwoman argued and Applicant became irritated. As they drove down a road, Applicant \nfired his gun out the window of the moving car. He apologized to the woman and gave \n\n5 \n \nher his gun. But she drove to a store to call the police. Applicant did not consider \nhimself intoxicated but he knew he was over the legal limit to drive. Applicant was \nconvicted of two counts of brandishing a weapon, served seven days in jail, and placed \non probation for six months. He completed the period of probation. He was monitored \nfor substance abuse while on probation. All tests were negative. (Tr. 59-65, 79-8; GX \n12, Police Report; GX 13, Court Record; GX 16, Incident Report; GX 17, Criminal \nHistory Report) \n \nApplicant had another incident with a weapon in 2015. By September 2015, his \nmother, who had been living with him, moved back to her home because Applicant was \nunable to care for her. Applicant also had problems with his special needs son, and the \nIRS was questioning him about his failure to file tax returns. Applicant was angry and \nfrustrated. He went outside and fired his gun into the air three times. On the day of the \nincident, Applicant consumed over a pint of alcohol. He was arrested and charged with \nreckless handling of a firearm and public intoxication. He was convicted and sentenced \nto twelve months of supervised probation. He wore an ankle bracelet from October 2015 \nuntil October 2016. He did not consume alcohol and successfully completed probation. \nHe no longer owes a firearm. However, he has continued to consume moderate \namounts of alcohol since ending his probation in October 2016. (Tr. 65-70, 80-81; GX \n14, Police Report; GX 15, Court Record; GX 16, Incident Report; GX 17, Criminal \nHistory Report)  \n \nApplicant presented a letter from a friend who is a psychologist and has known \nApplicant for over 25 years. The friend provided mentoring and counseling for Applicant. \nApplicant has been candid and transparent about the issues he has encountered \nincluding the death of his mother. He believes Applicant has taken the counseling he \nreceived to heart and is developing positive coping methods. He is resolving his \nfinancial issue and making restitution. He is taking strides to correct his past mistakes \nand entered substance abuse treatment. He is making efforts to reconcile with his wife. \nThe friend recommends that he be granted eligibility for access to classified information.  \n(AX E, Letter, dated October 31, 2018) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the Administrative Guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n6 \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations \nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. An individual \nwho is financially irresponsible, may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in \nhis obligations to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in \none aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects \nof life. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18).  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his or her creditors is a private matter until evidence \nis uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to meet financial obligations. \nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk inconsistent \nwith the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is required to manage his or her \nfinances in such a way as to meet financial obligations.  \n\n7 \n \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy in July 2016 and his debts were discharged in \nMarch 2017. Applicant admits that he has an income tax debt to the United States of \napproximately $35,000 because he did not file income tax returns for six years for tax \nyear 2009 through 2015. This information is sufficient to raise security concerns under \nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19: \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or pay annual Federal., state, or local income taxes as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax debt caused by his failure to timely file federal tax returns exhibits \nan inability and unwillingness to satisfy debts and meet financial obligations. Once the \nGovernment has established the adverse financial issue, the Applicant has the \nresponsibility to refute or mitigate the issue. Based on the information provided by \nApplicant, I considered the following Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible sources, such as a non-profit credit counselling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n\n8 \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions only partially apply. Applicant presented no evidence \nthat he received financial counseling. However, an individual must establish that they \ncompleted a required financial counseling course for debts to be discharged in \nbankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a permissible and legal method of resolving debt, but it does \nnot show for security clearance purposes a good-faith effort to resolve debts. Applicant \nfiled a bankruptcy action in 2016 and his debts were discharged in 2017. The available \nevidence shows that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2016 that was \nconverted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2016. Applicant\u2019s debts were \ndischarged in March 2017. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy action in 2016/2017 does not equate \nto a security concern.  \n \n \nThe information provided by Applicant shows that he has now filed the tax \nreturns and his tax debt is being resolved. However, there is a more fundamental issue \nfor security clearance purposes in not timely filing tax returns. Applicant admits he did \nnot timely file his federal tax returns because he did not have the funds to pay the taxes. \nThe lack of funds to pay taxes does not relieve a person from timely filing tax returns. \nApplicant\u2019s lack of action to file the returns resulted in his financial problems being \nongoing and recent, and not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely.  \n \nApplicant has shown his recent good-faith efforts to meet his tax and financial \nobligations by agreeing to a payment plan with the IRS. Good faith means acting in a \nway that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty and \nobligation. Applicant must act responsibly given his circumstances, and show that he \nhas a reasonable plan to resolve financial problems, and that he has taken significant \naction to implement that plan. Applicant\u2019s plan must show a systematic method of \nhandling financial obligations, and a meaningful track record of filing tax returns and \nresolving debts. A meaningful track record of tax return filing and resolving debt can be \nestablished by evidence of actually filing tax returns and establishing a plan to pay \ndebts. A promise to file tax returns and pay debts is not a substitute for a track record of \nfiling returns in a timely manner and acting in a financially responsible manner.  \n \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence that he filed his federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2009 through 2015 in 2016. All of these tax returns were filed late and not when \ndue. Failure to timely file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. It is well known that \nfederal tax returns for a particular tax year are to be filed by April 15 of the following \nyear. Voluntary compliance with government rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified and sensitive information. A person who fails to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligation to timely file tax returns does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required for a grant of access to classified or sensitive \ninformation. An applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns is a strong indication that the \nindividual may not follow the rules and guidance concerning safeguarding classified and \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nApplicant is now paying his past-due taxes, so AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. Even though \nApplicant has corrected the tax return problem and is paying his past-due taxes, there \n\n9 \n \nmust still be careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in view of his \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility by failing to timely file income tax \nreturns. Applicant did not timely file his tax returns because he did not have the funds to \npay the taxes due. There are procedures available to a taxpayer to file tax returns even \nif they do not have the funds available to pay the taxes. Applicant did not follow the \nestablished government rules and procedures and contact federal tax authorities for \nhelp to understand the actions he must take. He just simply failed to file the tax returns. \nBy failing to timely file federal tax returns for at least six years, Applicant did not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons \ngranted access to classified or sensitive information  \n \n \nIt is a requirement of good citizenship to timely file income tax returns. The fact \nthat he did not timely file returns indicates that Applicant was not acting responsibly and \nreliably. Applicant did not provide sufficient assurance that his tax filing problems are \nresolved, under control, and will not recur in the future. His lack of reasonable and \nresponsible actions towards his tax returns are a strong indication that he may not \nprotect and safeguard classified or sensitive information. Under all these circumstances, \nApplicant failed to mitigate financial security concerns.  \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption is a security concern because it often leads to \nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21)  \n \nApplicant was arrested for two incidents of firing a weapon after consuming \nalcohol in dangerous circumstances within four years. Available evidence shows \nApplicant continues to consume alcohol. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests, and his \ncontinued consumption of alcohol are sufficient to establish the following Alcohol \nConsumption Disqualifying Condition under AG \u00b6 22(a) (Alcohol-related incidents away \nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, \ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder).  \n \n \nI considered the following Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 \n23: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of action taken to overcome this problem, and has \n\n10 \n \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program. \n \nWhile there is no \"bright line\" rule for determining when conduct is recent or \nsufficient time has passed since the incidents, a determination whether past conduct \naffects an individual's present reliability and trustworthiness must be based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of \ntime has passed without evidence of an alcohol issue, there must be an evaluation \nwhether that period of time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto indicate a finding of reform or rehabilitation.  \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of two incidents of criminally firing a weapon after \nconsuming alcohol in 2011 and 2015. Applicant stated that he entered a VA substance \nabuse program the day before the hearing. He also admitted that he continues to \nconsume alcohol.  \n \n \nApplicant has not presented sufficient evidence to establish a pattern of \nabstinence and has not shown sufficient evidence of action taken to overcome his \nalcohol consumption problems. He did not present any evidence of participation in on-\ngoing programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. He admits that he has and continues to \nconsume alcohol. Accordingly, Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence to show \na change of circumstance. He has not established that he can now control his alcohol \nconsumption impulses. The evidence does not show that Applicant has been reformed \nor rehabilitated. I find that Applicant has not mitigated security concerns for alcohol \nconsumption. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations (AG \u00b6 30). Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal \nconvictions were verified by criminal justice reports. Applicant admits that alcohol \nconsumption was a cause of his criminal activity gun offenses. These criminal acts raise \nthe following Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conductions under AG \u00b6 31: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(b) allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether \nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \n \nI considered the following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 32: \n \n\n11 \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has been involved in weapons-\nrelated criminal activity in 2011 and 2015. These offenses did not happen under \nunusual circumstances, and the last offense happened only approximately three years \nago. Since Applicant still is consuming alcohol, the offenses may likely recur. There was \nno pressure to commit any of the offenses, and they appear to be voluntary. The only \nevidence of rehabilitation is the potential passage of a few years and Applicant no \nlonger having a gun. The evidence of criminal conduct adversely affects Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and leads to the conclusion that he cannot or \nwill not comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant has not presented sufficient \ninformation to mitigate criminal conduct security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the opinion of \nApplicant\u2019s friend that Applicant faced many challenges in recent years leading to his \nalcohol issues and financial problems. Applicant admitted his alcohol-related offenses \nand his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s conduct in failing to timely file his income tax \n\n12 \n \nreturns coupled with two criminal incidents of the wrongful discharge of a firearm after \nconsuming alcohol show irresponsible conduct and poor judgment. Overall, these facts \nleave me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and eligibility and suitability for access to classified information. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated alcohol consumption, \ncriminal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In a response signed on September 5, \n2015, and supplemented between September 11, 2015, and September 15, 2015, he \nadmitted four of the five allegations raised. He also requested a determination based on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing. In the interim, Applicant\u2019s employer ceased \nsponsoring Applicant for a security clearance in 2014 due to downsizing, thereby \neliminating this body\u2019s jurisdiction over the matter.  \nIn early 2018, Applicant was rehired by the same entity and again sponsored for \na security clearance, so processing of this case resumed. 1  On February 26, 2018, the \nGovernment issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) with six attachments (\u201cItems\u201d). \nApplicant\u2019s March 26, 2018, response to the FORM was received on April 4, 2018, and \naccepted into the record without objection. The case was assigned to me on May 17, \n2018. A request to introduce supplemental material was made by Applicant. After the \n1 This action was taken was considered under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n04/06/2018\n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nGovernment expressed no objection, a recommendation on Applicant\u2019s behalf was \naccepted into the record on September 6, 2018. The record was then closed. Based on \nmy review of the case file and submissions, I find Applicant failed to mitigate security \nconcerns. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice  \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Afghanistan) and The Russian Federation \n(Russia). With no objection to the inclusion of these materials, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained within those requests. Selected facts from \nthose sources are reflected below.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Findings of Fact \n \nAfghanistan \n \nAfghanistan is an Islamic Republic with a directly elected president, a bicameral \nlegislative branch, and a judicial branch. Afghanistan remains an important partner with \nthe United States against terrorism. Afghanistan works with the U.S. to eliminate the \nremnants of al-Qaeda and its affiliates. The U.S. continues to invest U.S. resources to \nhelp Afghanistan improve its security, governance, institutions and economy. The \nUnited States\u2019 strong bilateral relationship with Afghanistan is guided by the Enduring \nStrategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) between Afghanistan and the United States \nsigned in May 2012, which lays out economic and political commitments, as well as by \nthe 2014 Bilateral Security Agreement, which lays out mutual security understandings. \nIn July 2012, Afghanistan was designated a Major Non-NATO ally.  \n \nThe U.S. has engaged in on-going conflicts in Afghanistan since 2001. While \nthere has been a drawdown in the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, troops now \ntrain Afghan forces. U.S. forces continue to disrupt and degrade al-Qaeda and Islamic \nState activities in Afghanistan through partnered operations with Afghanistan, as well as \nunilateral operations. It is a U.S. priority to rid Afghanistan of terrorism.   \n \nThe U.S. Department of State, however, issued a travel advisory warning U.S. \ncitizens not to travel to Afghanistan because of continued instability and threats by \nterrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. Afghanistan also has significant human \nrights problems to include extrajudicial killings by security forces, ineffective government \ninvestigations of abuse and torture by local security forces, poor prison conditions, \narbitrary arrest and detention, and judicial corruption. Widespread disregard for the rule \nof law poses a serious problem. (Item 5) \n \nRussia  \n \nRussia has a highly centralized, authoritarian political system led by President \nVladimir Putin. Although \u201c[t]he United States has long sought a full and constructive \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nrelationship with Russia,\u201d current relations between the two old war allies appear to \nhave again turned adversarial. Of note, in August 2017, the President signed into U.S. \nlaw sanctions targeting Russia for, in part, Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. \nelections and Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, including its continuing unlawful \nannexation of Crimea. In 2015, the (former) Director of National Intelligence reported to \nCongress that the leading state intelligence threats to the United States will continue to \ncome from two main countries, one of which is Russia.  \n \nA recent human rights report from the U.S. State Department reflects the \ncommission of significant human rights violations in Russia, including restrictions on \npolitical participation and freedom of expression. It also noted the lack of due process in \npolitically motivated cases (Item 6) \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 61-year-old senior linguist. He first worked for his present employer \nin about 2014. After a brief period of unemployment to due to downsizing, he was again \nemployed as a linguist in approximately July 2016. His commander noted that his \nservices within a specialized area have been \u201cindispensible,\u201d and he lauded Applicant\u2019s \nskills. (Supplemental Response to FORM) Applicant is a dedicated and self-sufficient \nworker. He has received a letter of appreciation from a member of the highest ranks for \nhis commendable enthusiasm, unwavering willingness to perform his duties with such \nhigh caliber, and \u201cselfless generosity and commitment.\u201d (SOR Response, attachment) \nSeveral other letters of appreciation, recommendations, and certificates of appreciation \nwere also submitted by Applicant, reflecting his excellent work performance.  \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Afghanistan. There, Applicant earned both a \nbachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree in engineering before starting a career in general \nconstruction. In 1993, due to the upheaval and danger in Afghanistan, Applicant moved \nhis family to Russia as refugees. There, he leased an electronics store and \u201cworked \nvery hard\u201d to raise the funds to emigrate to the United States in 2004. He left Russia \nwhen he was in his late 40s, first returning the business to its landlord. (SOR Response \nat 2) Applicant and his family, including his wife and six adult children, became \nnaturalized U.S. citizens in early 2010. Applicant honors his oath as a U.S. citizen and is \ncommitted to defending this country.  \n \n \nIn Afghanistan, Applicant left a brother who was a citizen and resident of that \ncountry. The brother passed away in November 2016. (FORM Response) The two had \nnot communicated for a few years before the brother died.  \n \nApplicant has one daughter who came to the United States after he did. She  \nremains a citizen of Afghanistan, is currently a registered alien living in the United \nStates, and has applied for U.S. citizenship. In 2014, she began to suspect that her \nhusband, a citizen of Afghanistan, was using her and their marriage to obtain U.S. \nresidency. (SOR Answer at 2) This son-in-law, a citizen of Afghanistan, was last known \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nto be a U.S. resident.2 The couple divorced in late 2015. Neither Applicant nor his family \nmembers maintain contact with this former in-law. Applicant\u2019s daughter, like four of her \nother siblings, lives near or with Applicant and his wife in the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s sixth child, another daughter, has remained a citizen and resident of \nRussia. She and her husband, who is also a citizen and resident of Russia, have three \nyoung children. In March 2012, Applicant\u2019s wife filed a sponsoring petition on behalf of \nthis daughter, son-in-law, and children to immigrate to the United States. (FORM \nResponse) That petition is still being processed. Applicant maintains bi-weekly contact \nwith his daughter through an Internet program. \n \nApplicant\u2019s Russian kin do not know of Applicant\u2019s work and \u201chave no idea that \n[he] worked [in a capacity aiding the United States].\u201d (FORM Response) Only \nApplicant\u2019s wife knows of Applicant\u2019s work and his place of employment. No family \nmember is in fear due to his work. (FORM Response) Applicant emphatically conveyed \nthat his \u201cfamily members do not represent a cause of divided loyalty\u201d for him, nor can \nthey be used to coerce him into assisting a foreign power. (FORM Response) None of \nhis family members are affiliated with any foreign military or organizations. Applicant \nsends no money to his family members abroad because he has \u201chis own family \nmembers . . . in the U.S. and [he is] working hard to support them, and they are [his] \nfirst and last priorities. . . . \u201c (FORM Response) In 2017, Applicant bought a new home \nin a new state, where his wife and all but his Russian-based child now reside. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under the \nAG, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national interest. In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n                                                          \n2 The SOR allegation at 1.c alleges that Applicant has a son-in-law who is a citizen and resident of \nAfghanistan and is employed by the Afghan Foreign Ministry. This son-in-law now lives somewhere in the \nUnited States. His present employer is unknown. \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. Under the Directive, an applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizen to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nApplicant has natural ties of affection with multiple family members who are \ncitizens of either Afghanistan or Russia, and residents of either Afghanistan, Russia, or \nthe United States. These include or have included Applicant\u2019s brother, two daughters, \nand two sons-in-law. It may be assumed he maintains normal familial attachments with \nhis sibling, daughters, and in-laws. Such contacts could compromise Applicant or his \nkin. I find disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a)-(b) potentially apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, \nand \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides three conditions that could possibly mitigate security concerns:   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interests in favor of \nthe U.S. interests; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nThe presence of terrorism in Afghanistan is well established. Russia\u2019s active \npursuit of U.S. protected information is similarly recognized. Consequently, these \ncountries represent zones of high risk in terms of the security of Applicant\u2019s kin and the \npossibility foreign interests could pursue protected information believed to be in the \npossession of Applicant.  \n \nApplicant has clearly set forth that he is a proud U.S. citizen who is committed to \ndefending this country. He arrived in the United States in 2004 and became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen eight years ago. He lives in this country with his wife, and all but \none of his children also live with him in the United States. As a family unit, they trailed \nalong with Applicant when he moved and purchased a new home in a new state in \n2017. There, they are enjoying the benefits of living in the United States of America. \nApplicant is committed to his life in the United States and to providing a secure and \nfinancially stable home base for his domestic kin. Except for two of his daughters, all of \nApplicant\u2019s children are naturalized United States citizens. \n \nApplicant\u2019s recently divorced daughter who lives in the United States, but retains \nAfghan citizenship, resides with Applicant. She is in the process of becoming a U.S. \ncitizen. The family maintains no relationship with her ex-husband. As for Applicant\u2019s \nbrother in Afghanistan, he passed away in 2016 after a period devoid of communication \nwith Applicant. Applicant has no remaining relations in Afghanistan.  \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nRemaining abroad is the daughter of Applicant who resides in Russia with her \nhusband and three children. While Applicant maintains communication with this \ndaughter every two weeks via the Internet, neither she, her husband, nor any of \nApplicant\u2019s family except Applicant\u2019s wife know of his career or where he works. No \nmoney is sent to the couple in Russia, as Applicant focuses on providing for his \nimmediate family residing with or near him in the United States. Applicant\u2019s wife has \ninitiated sponsorship for the Russian kin to immigrate to the United States. Their status \ntoward that goal is presently pending. None of Applicant\u2019s relations have a nexus with a \nforeign government or organization. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a)-(b) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed in the AG. \nThe final determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person \nanalysis based on the written record. In addition to Applicant\u2019s foreign relations, I \nconsidered factors such as his age, profession, education, and employment history.  \n \nThe facts offered with regard to Applicant\u2019s family members with a nexus to \nAfghanistan and Russia were substantially updated in 2018. Applicant\u2019s brother in \nAfghanistan has been deceased for a couple of years after a period of non-\ncommunication. The first of Applicant\u2019s daughters at issue is now a legal resident of the \nUnited States with an application pending for U.S. citizenship; she has divorced her \nAfghan husband and her family no longer has contact with him. \n \nRemaining at issue is Applicant\u2019s daughter and son-in-law in Russia, the country \nin which Applicant and his family resided for several years as refugees from \nAfghanistan. While Applicant maintains contact with this daughter via the Internet \nregularly, she does not know what he does for a living or where he works. Neither she \nnor her husband has a nexus to a foreign government or military. Applicant\u2019s spouse \nhas submitted sponsorship applications to permit this daughter and her family to \nimmigrate to the United States.  \n \nWhile the Russian kin pose some degree of concern, both Applicant\u2019s expressed \nfeelings and track record reflect that he considers the United States to be his family\u2019s \nseat. There is a demonstrated intent to reassemble his large family in his new state of \nresident. He owns a home large enough to accommodate his family. He is devoted to \nhis work. He uses his income for the betterment of his family in the United States only, \nconsidering those individuals to be of his utmost concern. At the same time, Applicant is \nexceptionally lauded for his translating work in a specific field. His recommendations \nand letters of appreciation are impressive. He is clearly an experienced and valuable \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \naddition to his employer\u2019s mission. Considering all these factors, I conclude Applicant\u2019s \nloyalty to the United States outweighs his loyalties for the Russian family now \nattempting to immigrate to the United States.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

He has been so employed since 2002. He serves as the lead of a fabrication shop located on a U.S. military installation. His educational background includes a high school diploma and about two years of college. He has married and divorced twice, with the last divorce in 2005. He has two adult children from his marriages. His employment history include military service in the U.S. Army from 1981 to 1995.

Applicant does not dispute or contest the allegations. He disclosed that he failed to file state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2005, as a result of his second divorce, in his March 2014 security clearance application.

Although he is now in compliance with federal and \nstate tax authorities, his tax problems went on for far too many years to justify complete \nmitigation. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non March 17, 2014. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on December 12, 2014, after reviewing the \napplication and the information gathered during a background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent \nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 16, 2015. He admitted all the \nallegations concerning failure to timely file state and federal income tax returns for a \nnumber of tax years. He also requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was initially processed as a non-\nhearing case in about April 2015, but for reasons that are unclear the case was \nmisplaced or not assigned to an administrative judge or both. (Tr. 15-17) The case \nresurfaced in 2018, Department Counsel contacted Applicant, and he indicated that he \nhad changed his mind and wanted a hearing, which he confirmed in writing on July 9, \n2018.   \n \nThe case was assigned to me on July 12, 2018. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on September 20, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered a single documentary exhibit, which was admitted as Exhibit 1. \nApplicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-X. Other \nthan Applicant, no witnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on \nSeptember 27, 2018. \n \nThe record was kept open until October 5, 2018, and then extended by ten days, \nto provide Applicant an opportunity to present additional documentation concerning his \ntax problems. Those matters were timely received on October 11, 2018, and it is \nadmitted without objections as Exhibit Y.     \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance.

He disclosed that he failed to file state and \nfederal income tax returns for tax year 2005, as a result of his second divorce, in his \nMarch 2014 security clearance application. (Exhibit 1) He attributed his tax problems to \nfalling behind on his tax obligations, embarrassment, and inaction. (Tr. 30, 47-48) He \ndescribed his situation as follows: \n \nWhat happened at the time was I\u2019d gotten behind in my taxes and owed \nalmost $2,000, which I could not afford and simply got behind in my taxes \nand then felt embarrassed to bring it current. And each year, not having a \nprevious tax return, I just hoped it would not surface or anything. (Tr. 30) \n\n \n3 \n \nHe decided to take action to address his problematic tax situation after completing his \nMarch 2014 security clearance application. (Tr. 31-32)  \n \nApplicant is now in compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. Due to \nage, he was unable to file returns before tax year 2009, but he provided documentary \nproof of filing state and federal tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2017. (Exhibits A-\nY). He explained that he filed the returns periodically due to the cost involved using a \ntax preparer and availability of funds. (Tr. 34-35; Exhibit A) Going forward, his plan is to \nstay current with his tax obligations and never get into a similar situation. (Tr. 36) \n \nConcerning the federal income tax returns, Applicant filed returns as follows: (1) \n2009 past due in April 2014; (2) 2010 past due in April 2014; (3) 2011 past due in \nJanuary 2015; (4) 2012 past due in March 2015; (5) 2013 past due in April 2016; (6) \n2014 timely in March 2015; (7) 2015 timely in April 2016; (8) 2016 past due in July \n2018; and (9) 2017 filed past due in July 2018. (Exhibits G-O) IRS account transcripts \nfor tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 show account balances of $0 for those three years. \n(Exhibits C-F)   \n \nConcerning the state income tax returns, Applicant filed returns as follows: (1) \n2009 past due in April 2014; (2) 2011 past due in January 2015; (3) 2012 past due in \nMarch 2015; (4) 2013 past due in April 2016; (5) 2014 timely in March 2015; (6) 2015 \ntimely in April 2016; (7) 2016 past due in July 2018; and (8) 2017 past due in July 2018. \n(Exhibits P-X) He received a $512 refund from the state tax authority for tax year 2017. \n(Exhibit B; Tr. 21) The state tax authority issued Applicant a certificate of \ncompliance/letter of good standing on September 26, 2018. (Exhibit Y)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required; and  \n                                                          \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nApplicant made good progress in resolving the tax matters, and he is now in \ncompliance with both federal and state tax authorities. That means he has filed all tax \nreturns, as required, and he has paid all taxes due, as required. And he did a good job \ndocumenting his compliance.  \n \n \nIn addressing this issue, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns \nand pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the \nfederal government. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who \nfails repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax \nwhen due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017).  \n \n \nHere, I am concerned about the duration of Applicant\u2019s tax problems and the \ntiming of his remedial action. Applicant failed to timely file state and federal income tax \nreturns for more than a decade. He has been in compliance for a relatively brief period \nof time compared with the time of his noncompliance. It is also noted that both his state \nand federal returns for the last two tax years, 2017 and 2018, were filed past the due \ndate. Considering the totality of facts and circumstances, it is far too soon to tell if he will \ncontinue to meet his tax obligations on a timely basis. Accordingly, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(g) applies, but the evidence is not sufficient to justify complete \nmitigation of his long-standing irresponsibility in failing to meet his legal obligations.    \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility denied.  \n \n \n \nMichael H. Leonard \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Hackett, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the personal conduct and alcohol consumption security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline E, personal \nconduct. Applicant responded to the SOR on May 24, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On August 22, 2018, Department Counsel amended the \nSOR to add an additional allegation under Guideline E and allegations under Guideline \nG, alcohol consumption. Applicant responded to the amended SOR on September 20, \n2018. \nThe case was assigned to me on November 1, 2018. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 14, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for January 23, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nThe Government called two witnesses and submitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 14, which were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \n02/07/2019\n\n \n2 \n \ncalled two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were \nadmitted without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ninformation. He submitted AE E, which was admitted without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2014. He served in the U.S. military from 1983 until he \nretired with an honorable discharge in 2003. He seeks to retain a security clearance, \nwhich he has held since he was in the military. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, awarded in \n2009, and a master\u2019s degree, awarded in 2011. He is married with three adult children \nand three adult stepchildren.1 \n \n \nApplicant has a history of driving and alcohol-related incidents, and problems in \nthe workplace. The alcohol and driving incidents will be addressed first. He was \narrested twice in about 1978 to 1979 for driving under the influence (DUI). He was about \n18 or 19 years old at the time. When he was interviewed for a background investigation \nin 1987, he stated that he was fined more than $100 for one of the DUIs, but he did not \nrecall the amount of the other fine. At his hearing, he initially testified that he could not \nremember being arrested for DUI during that time period. He eventually conceded that \nhe had been arrested as alleged, but he later again stated that he could not recall \nwhether the incidents occurred. Applicant\u2019s testimony and statements about this and \nother incidents were evasive, inconsistent, and not credible.2 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in May 1988 and charged with drunk driving and \nspeeding by going 49 miles per hour (MPH) in a 35 MPH zone. He pleaded guilty to \nreckless driving, and the speeding offense was dismissed. He paid a $200 fine, and his \nlicense was suspended for 30 days.3 \n \n \nApplicant wrote in his response to the SOR that he \u201cstopped at a local bar that \nserved alcohol, and [he] recall[ed] drinking one beer.\u201d He stated that the drunk driving \ncharge was reduced and \u201cwould have been dismissed if it weren\u2019t for the speed.\u201d He \nadmitted at his hearing that he may have had two or more beers. The military police \nreport of the incident indicates that Applicant failed the field sobriety test and his blood \nalcohol content (BAC) was measured at 12% and 13%. He testified that the BAC may \nhave been affected by his dentures.4 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 73-74, 85-88; GE 1; AE D. \n \n2 Tr. at 103-107, 118-119; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 14.

It may be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis. \n \n3 Tr. at 110; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 12. \n \n4 Tr. at 111-113; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 12. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was charged with public swearing/intoxication in July 2007. He paid a \n$71 fine, and the charge was subsequently dismissed. Applicant stated that the police \nwere called after an argument with his wife.5 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in June 2013 and charged with driving while intoxicated \n(DWI), first offense. He pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of reckless driving. He was \nsentenced to 60 days in jail, with all time suspended; probation for 12 months; a \nrestricted driver\u2019s license; and a $500 fine.6 \n \n \nApplicant stated that he had no more than three beers at a baseball game, and \nhe did not think his driving would be impaired. He admitted that his BAC was .09% to \n.10%. When he was interviewed for his background investigation in March 2014, he \nstated that the 2013 arrest was an isolated incident and not part of a pattern of alcohol-\nrelated issues. He denied ever being charged with any other alcohol-related offenses.7 \nHe wrote in his response to the SOR: \n \nDuring my court appearance the prosecution agreed to reduce the charge \nto reckless driving because this was my first and only offense in my entire \ndriving history at the time which was considered as mitigating evidence. \nTherefore, I was officially charged with a lesser charge of reckless driving. \nI plead[ed] guilty and paid the applicable fine. I emphasize that this was \nmy first offense, at that time, in my entire driving history. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not intend to be dishonest, and that he said he had \nonly one alcohol-related driving offense because he thought the investigation was \nlimited to the previous seven years. He also stated that he thought that because the \ncharges had been reduced to reckless driving, they did not count.8  \n  \n \nApplicant was charged in 2014 with the misdemeanor offense of reckless driving: \nimproper brakes. He was found guilty of the lesser offense of improper control/driving. \nApplicant stated that he was reaching for a pair of sunglasses when a car cut in front of \nhim and abruptly stopped. He hit the back of the car. Alcohol was not involved.9 \n \n \nApplicant attended and completed alcohol counseling as a requirement of his \nprobation for the 2013 offense. He stated that he has learned from the experience, he \ndoes not drink to excess, there have been no additional driving offenses, and there will \nbe no additional alcohol-related incidents.10   \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 110-111; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 13. \n \n6 Tr. at 111; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4. \n \n7 Tr. at 111; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n8 Tr. at 107-109. \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n10 Tr. at 114-117, 119-120; GE 2. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant was terminated from a job in 2007 after his employer discovered \nmultiple pornographic files on his network drive. Applicant stated that he was leaving the \ncompany, and he brought in a compact disc (CD) from home to copy some personal \nfiles from his work computer. He mistakenly picked up a CD that had pornography on it. \nHe stated that he did not intentionally place the files on the network drive, and that they \nwere accidentally uploaded to the drive while he was copying other files. He stated that \nhe was terminated the next day, \u201con the same day that [he] had planned to resign.\u201d11 \n \n \nApplicant provided a similar, but slightly different, account of the termination \nduring a January 2009 background interview. He stated that he accidently copied the \npornographic material onto his work computer from a memory stick. He was fired about \ntwo weeks later, and he did not mention that he had already planned to resign.12 \n \n \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor from about March 2013 until his \ncontact was terminated as the result of a layoff in October 2013. In April 2013, he \nviolated policy when he downloaded a file from his personal e-mail account, which \ncontained multiple usernames and passwords for DOD accounts and other personal \naccount information. He received a written reprimand in which he was directed to take \nadditional training, with a warning that if his \u201cfuture activities result in additional security \nincidents, disciplinary action, such as a formal performance action plan or involuntary \nseparation, may follow.\u201d Applicant admitted that he had an Excel spreadsheet with \n\u201cnonworking\u201d old passwords that he used to keep track of old passwords, so that he \nwould not use them again.13 \n  \n \nIn about September 2013, Applicant plugged his personal phone into his work \ncomputer to charge the phone. He immediately removed it when he was told that he \nhad violated security rules.14 \n \n \nApplicant was at a work meeting in about October 2013 when he commented to \nthe person next to him to the effect that if he brought his firearm, he could take out the \nentire leadership or a bomb could do the same. Applicant denied making a threat. He \nmeant the comment to be a precaution about the lack of security in the facility.15 \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded, as reported by two witnesses and various \ndocuments. He is praised for his excellent job performance, work ethic, trustworthiness, \nprofessionalism, and integrity.16 \n                                                          \n11 Tr. at 88-91; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3, 11, 14. \n \n12 GE 14. \n \n13 Tr. at 20-21, 28-29, 74, 77-79, 91-93; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 5, 10; AE E.  \n \n14 Tr. at 93-94; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2.  \n \n15 Tr. at 43-45, 79-82, 96-99; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n16 Tr. at 59-71; AE B, C. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder.  \n \nApplicant was arrested on four occasions for DUI, drunk driving, or DWI. He was \ncharged with public swearing/intoxication in 2007. AG \u00b6 22(a) is applicable.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related offense was in 2013. He attended and \ncompleted alcohol counseling as a requirement of his probation. He stated that he has \nlearned from the experience, he does not currently drink to excess, and there will be no \nadditional alcohol-related incidents. However, Applicant\u2019s testimony about his arrests \nwas inconsistent, contradictory, and not worthy of belief. Without candor, I am unable to \nconclude that the conduct is unlikely to recur.   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI find that Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) is not applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and \n23(d) have some applicability, but they are insufficient to overcome concerns about his \nalcohol-related criminal conduct.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal conduct is cross-alleged under Guideline E. \nThat conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s \nconduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct guidelines. However, the general concerns about questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15 and 16(c) are established for the alcohol-related conduct.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges the 2013 DWI. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges all of the alcohol-related \nconduct, including the 2013 DWI. There is no conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.b that is not also \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.b is \nconcluded for Applicant.  \n \nApplicant violated policy and security rules and procedures in 2007 by having \npornographic files on his network drive; in 2013, when he downloaded a file from his \npersonal e-mail account, which contained multiple usernames and passwords for DOD \naccounts and other personal account information; and again in 2013, when he plugged \nhis personal phone into his work computer. He was charged in 2014 with the \nmisdemeanor offense of reckless driving: improper brakes. He was found guilty of the \nlesser offense of improper control/driving. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and \n16(d) are not perfectly applicable because the conduct is sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under other guidelines. However, the general concerns about \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16(c), and 16(d) are established.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant was removed from his position in October 2013 \nprior to his scheduled end date on the contract after he made threatening comments \ntoward the leadership. That allegation is not established by substantial evidence. SOR \u00b6 \n1.e is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n9 \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nAny one or more of the allegations could be mitigated if they were considered on \ntheir own in a piecemeal basis. However, the number of allegations, combined with \nApplicant\u2019s lack of candor, preclude mitigation. Concerns about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment remain. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and G in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and his excellent character evidence. However, he has \nmultiple alcohol-related driving offenses and work problems, and he cannot be trusted \nto tell the truth. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and alcohol consumption security concerns.  \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and underemployment contributed to or \naggravated her financial problems. Under her circumstances, she has been responsibly \naddressing her delinquent accounts. With her current earnings, she should be able to \npay for her family\u2019s living expenses and current debts. Her financial problems are being \nresolved. Clearance granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 18, \n2012, seeking to continue the clearance required for her position with a federal \ncontractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) on August 15, 2015, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). She requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \nThe Notice of Hearing (NOH) was issued on December 30, 2015, setting a \nhearing for January 25, 2016. That hearing was cancelled on January 14, 2016, after \nApplicant\u2019s employment was terminated and DOHA lost jurisdiction over her case. \n10/30/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant was rehired by a federal contractor on March 1, 2017. (Tr. 11) Her case was \nreopened as a \u201cpriority case,\u201d and DOHA assigned the case to me on June 7, 2018. A \nnew NOH was issued on June 20, 2018, setting the hearing for June 29, 2018. \nApplicant affirmatively waived her right to 15-days advanced notice of her hearing both \non June 11, 2018, and at her hearing. (See Hearing Exhibit 1; Tr. 11-13) \n \nAt the hearing, the Government offered two exhibits (GE 1 and 2). Applicant \ntestified and submitted two exhibits. (AE 1 and 2) All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 11, 2018. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the August 2015 SOR on June 7, 2018. \nThe amendment requested the striking of SOR \u00b6 1.a, and substituting for it four new \nfinancial specifications: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. Applicant did not object and the \namendment was granted as requested. (Tr. 14-15) The motion to amend the SOR, \ndated June 8, 2018, and Applicant\u2019s answers to the amended SOR, dated June 26, \n2018, were made part of the pleadings and are attached to the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant did not specifically admit or deny any of the SOR \nallegations. However, through her comments, explanations, and the documentary \nevidence provided, she indirectly admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.d). Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR and at her hearing are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, including her testimony \nand demeanor while testifying, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She completed an \nassociate\u2019s degree in December 2006, and is currently working on her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. She has never been married. She has three adult children, ages 26, 22, and 20.  \n \nApplicant started working for federal contractors in 2000, and she has been \nconsistently employed by federal contractors to present, except for two unemployment \nperiods from October 2015 through June 2016 (nine months), and August 2016 through \nFebruary 2017 (seven months). Applicant was granted a secret clearance in 2002, \nwhich was upgraded to a top-secret clearance in 2004. She has continuously held her \nclearance eligibility since 2002 to present, except for a period during which it was \nsuspended due to a lack of sponsor. There is no evidence showing any additional \nsecurity concerns, except for those in the current SOR.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s October 2015 employment termination apparently was due to \ndisciplinary or performance-related issues. (Tr. 34-37) Following her termination, \nApplicant was underemployed or unemployed. During her period of unemployment, \nApplicant took temporary jobs, including a job as a driver. She received unemployment \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbenefits, took loans, and used her credit to pay her living expenses and her children\u2019s \ncollege expenses.  \n \nApplicant explained that between October 2015 and July 2017, her income was \ninsufficient to pay her family\u2019s living expenses, assist her children with their college \nexpenses, and pay her debts. An investment property and her home were about to be \nforeclosed and she had numerous delinquent debts. Applicant sold the investment \nproperty and modified the home mortgage, taking it out of foreclosure and bringing the \nmortgage to current.  \n \nIn July 2017, Applicant\u2019s current employer, a federal contractor, hired her as a \nfinancial manager. Her income went from making $25 an hour, to a yearly salary of \n$115,000. Since July 2017, Applicant has been diligently addressing her delinquent \naccounts, many of which were not alleged in the SOR. Applicant was unable to start \npaying her delinquent accounts any sooner because she was the main breadwinner of \nthe family and her income was insufficient to pay all of their financial obligations at the \nsame time. Applicant had three children attending college. She elected to forego taking \nstudent loans for their children. Instead, she provided financial assistance to them to \nenable them to complete college without loans. \n \nIn her 2012 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had financial problems that \nincluded a delinquent mortgage, delinquent student loans, personal loans in default, and \ndelinquent consumer credit accounts. The SOR alleged four delinquent or charged-off \naccounts. Based on Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence (submitted with the SOR \nresponse), the status of the alleged debts is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a (collection for $1,045). Applicant paid this account in May 2018. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b (charged-off debt for $4,080). Applicant paid $1,025 and decreased \nthe balance from $4,080 to $2,629 in April 2018. She anticipated paying off this debt by \nthe end of 2018. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c (charged-off car loan for $19,302). Applicant paid $1,331 in June \n2018. She established a monthly payment plan. The documentary evidence shows that \nshe decreased the balance from $19,302 to $10,647. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d (charged-off loan for $27,238). Applicant established a payment plan \nand has been paying $455 a month. She decreased the balance from $27,238 to \n$21,333. \n \nApplicant acknowledged that she should have been more diligent paying her \ndelinquent accounts. However, she believes she was doing the best she could do under \nher circumstances. She paid as much of her delinquent accounts as she could to \nbalance the payments of her other debts. She understands the seriousness of the \nsecurity concerns raised by her financial problems. She promised to timely pay her \ndebts in the future. Applicant highlighted her 18 years of employment with federal \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontractors while holding a clearance during most of that period without any issues or \nconcerns, except for his financial problems. Applicant credibly promised to continue \npaying her debts and to resolve her financial problems. She believes that with her \ncurrent income, her financial situation is now stable, and she will be able to maintain her \nfinancial responsibility and eligibility for a clearance. Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling, but she is following a budget. (Tr. 50) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n\n \n5 \n \n \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. She \ndeveloped financial problems around 2016, because she was terminated from her \nposition. Because of her periods of unemployment and underemployment, she acquired \nsubstantial debt. AG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \nand \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \n\n \n6 \n \n \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;1 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nAll of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are raised by the \nfacts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nongoing and recent because she is still paying her delinquent debts. However, her \nfinancial problems occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur and they do not cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \n                                            \n1 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems could be attributed to, or were aggravated by, her \nperiods of unemployment or underemployment with the subsequent decrease in family \nearnings. It is not clear whether Applicant losing her job was due to her own \nmisconduct. Nevertheless, I find that Applicant\u2019s actions after losing her job \ndemonstrate financial responsibility. She took part-time jobs to supplement her \nunemployment income and used her savings and credit to pay for some of her \ndelinquent accounts. \n \n \nThe June 2018 credit report in evidence show 34 trade lines, with only the four \naccounts alleged in the SOR being delinquent. After obtaining full-time employment with \nher current employer in March 2017, Applicant started to address her delinquent \naccounts. She paid off one account and has reduced substantially her debt on the \nremaining three accounts. Applicant also identified as factors that prevented her from \npaying her debts more diligently including her mortgage payments, her financial support \nfor three children attending college, and the necessity to pay other debts and living \nexpenses.  \n \n \nApplicant is making a good-faith effort to resolve her debt. Her actions, although \nrecent, show diligence and responsibility in the handling of her financial obligations. \nApplicant has not received financial counseling, but she is following a budget. She is in \nthe process of addressing her financial obligations in a manner consistent with her \nfinancial resources.  \n \n \nI find that the evidence does not support a finding that she was negligent in the \npayment of her financial obligations. She simply was not able to pay all her debts at the \nsame time. She divided her financial resources between her financial obligations and \nher living expenses in order to provide for her children\u2019s education.  \n \nThe AGs do not require an Applicant to immediately resolve or pay each and \nevery debt alleged in the SOR, to be debt free, or to resolve first the debts alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. Applicant has implemented a plan to resolve \nher financial problems and she has made significant progress implementing her plan. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, and including her recent actions, Applicant \ndemonstrated financial responsibility. She disclosed her financial problems in her 2012 \nSCA. Her financial situation is improving and there are clear indications that her \nfinancial problems are being resolved and are under control. She has been paying her \ndelinquent accounts and promised to continue to do so. Her earnings should be \nsufficient to pay for her family\u2019s living expenses and current debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nfederal contractors since 2000. She has held a clearance during most of her \nemployment without any issues or concerns, except for her financial problems. The \nrecord evidence is sufficient to establish that her financial problems are being resolved \nand are under control.  \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Applicant demonstrated a recent track \nrecord of paying her financial obligations. She is fully aware of the security concerns \nraised by her failure to maintain financial responsibility. She promised to maintain her \nfinancial responsibility. The financial considerations security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest of the United States to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance to Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Cohen, Esq. \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nCurry, Marc, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns generated by his contacts and financial \ninterests in the Philippines. The romantic relationship that he had with a Thai woman \nseveral years ago when he was working in Estonia generates no security concern. As \nfor security concerns under the personal conduct guideline, Applicant did not falsify his \n2012 security clearance application, and his acquaintances who are Filipino natives and \nresidents do not generate personal conduct security concerns. In sum, Applicant has \nmitigated all of the security concerns. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 9, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline E (personal conduct). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on \nSeptember 1, 2006. \n01/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nThe SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the \nGovernment, DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. It recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a \ndetermination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 29, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR, denying all of the \nallegations except 1.d and 1.e, and requested a hearing.1 The case was initially \nassigned to another administrative judge on June 13, 2018, before it was transferred to \nme on September 18, 2018. On September 21, 2018, the hearing was scheduled for \nOctober 5, 2018.  \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel submitted five documents for admission that \nI marked as Government Exhibits (GEs) 1 through 5. Counsel for Applicant objected to \nthe admission of GE 4 and GE 5. I sustained the objection, only admitting GEs 1 \nthrough 3 into the record. Upon reconsideration, I have decided to admit GE 4. \n \nCounsel for Applicant proposed 26 exhibits for admission. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) \nA \u2013 AE Z) I admitted all of these exhibits into the record except AE O, which I excluded \nafter considering Department Counsel\u2019s objection. \n \nAt the hearing, I also incorporated Department Counsel\u2019s list of Government \nExhibits (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I), and a copy of Department Counsel\u2019s discovery letter \n(HE II). In addition, Department Counsel submitted a memo (HE III) requesting that I \ntake administrative notice of the facts set forth in four U.S. Department of State \ndocuments regarding the Philippines (HE IV \u2013 HE VIII). Applicant\u2019s counsel objected. I \nstayed my decision on the administrative notice request, leaving the record open \nthrough October 26, 2018 to allow Applicant\u2019s counsel to respond to Department \nCounsel\u2019s request, and to submit administrative notice documents, if desired. Within the \ntime allotted, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted a memo (HE IX) requesting that I take \nadministrative notice of the facts set forth in eight documents (HE X \u2013 XVIII). After \nconsidering all of the facts set forth in the exhibits provided by both parties, I have \ndecided to take administrative notice of all of them except HE XV, Human Rights Watch \n2016\u2014The United States, and HE XVI, Department of Justice Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation: 2016 Crime in the United States.  \n \nWhile my decision was pending, Security Executive Agent Directive 4 was issued \nestablishing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) applicable to all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information \nor eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The AG supersede the adjudicative guidelines \n                                            \n1 There are six allegations under Paragraph 1 and five allegations under Paragraph 2. The Paragraph 1 \nallegations are correctly annotated as subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f. The Paragraph 2 allegations are \nerroneously annotated as 2.g through 2.k rather than 2.a through 2.e. After Department Counsel identified \nthis error at the hearing and discussed it with Applicant\u2019s counsel, the parties suggested that, as a matter \nof judicial economy, I forego amending the SOR,and rule upon the allegations, as written. I concurred. \n(Tr. 7-8) \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nimplemented in September 2006 and are effective for any adjudication made on or after \nJune 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have adjudicated Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility \nunder the new AG. The transcript was received on October 16, 2018. \n \nPreliminary Rulings \n \n \n1. Section 19 of the security clearance application that Applicant completed in \n2012 contains the following question: \n \nDo you have, or have you had, close and/or continuing contact with a \nforeign national within the last seven (7) years with whom you, or your \nspouse, or cohabitant are bound by affection, influence, common \ninterests, and/or obligation? . . .\u201d \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno,\u201d elaborating as follows: \n \nI have several women that I have met in my foreign travels, but none that I \nwould consider to be seriously bound by affection or obligatien [sic] with. \n \nSOR subparagraph 2.h alleges Applicant\u2019s \u201cno\u201d answer constitutes a falsification. \nCounsel for Applicant filed a motion to dismiss this claim, arguing that the allegation, on \nits face, does not state a justiciable claim.  \n \n \nWhether the nature of Applicant\u2019s relationships with these foreign women is as \ncasual as he believes them to be is certainly an issue to be addressed under the \nGuideline B security concerns, as alleged in Paragraph 1. Similarly, the nature and \nappropriateness of these relationships raise a Guideline E issue, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 2.g. However, Applicant\u2019s negative response to Section 19, in conjunction \nwith his disclosure that he has met several women over the years during his foreign \ntravels whom he is not bound by affection or obligation is sufficiently candid and \nforthcoming, so as not to raise any issue of falsification, on its face. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel\u2019s motion to dismiss subparagraph 2.h is granted. (DoD Directive 5220.6, \nE3.1.10) \n \n \n2. Section 20B of the 2012 security clearance application required Applicant to \ndisclose if he had ever provided financial support for any foreign national. His negative \nanswer, together with his detailed elaboration,2 is candid and forthcoming. \nConsequently, subparagraph 2.i, on its face, raises no issue of falsification. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel\u2019s motion to dismiss subparagraph 2.i is granted. (DoD Directive 5220.6, \nE3.1.10) \n \n                                            \n2There have been several foreign women I have given money to via Western Union in the \nPhilippines as gifts to help them, but I would not consider the gifts as long-term financial support. I \ndo not know their addresses to be able to answer the questions properly if I answered \u2018yes.\u2019 \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n3. Section 20A of the 2012 security clearance application required Applicant to \ndisclose whether he had any additional foreign financial interests. Applicant\u2019s negative \nresponse was not followed by any additional explanation. The issue of whether his \nresponse constitutes a falsification, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 2.j, must be \nevaluated through the record evidence developed at the hearing. Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s \nmotion to dismiss subparagraph 2.j is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old single man who was married previously between 1987 \nand 1995. The marriage ended in divorce. He has a high school diploma and has \nearned some college credits. (Tr. 231) After graduating from high school, he enlisted in \nthe U.S. Air Force in 1982, serving through his retirement in 2003. (GE 2 at 13) Per a \nfellow Air Force veteran who served with him, he is an honest, trustworthy man who is \nhardworking and dependable. (AE W)  \n \nAfter retirement, Applicant worked stateside for a defense contractor for a year, \nthrough approximately May 2004. Since then, he has lived and worked for contractors \nalmost exclusively in combat zones. (Tr. 87; AE B) He is a radar technician who is \nresponsible for the installation, upgrade, maintenance, and repair of radars and radios. \n(Tr. 89; AE B) He has held a security clearance since 1982. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s work is extremely dangerous. He lives and works on base, embedded \nwith the soldiers, and he frequently comes under enemy fire. (Tr. 80, 86) He typically \nworks 12 hours per day for seven days a week. (Tr. 89) He shares his living space, a six \nfoot by eight foot converted cargo container, with three roommates. (Tr. 91-92) Per \nApplicant\u2019s employment contract, he is allowed to take vacation leave every six months. \nHe does not always use his leave \u201cbecause the needs of the military come first.\u201d (Tr. \n125) As of the hearing date, he had been working continuously without break for more \nthan 12 months. (Tr. 125)  \n \nPer a coworker, Applicant is \u201cthe go-to guy whenever systems [go] down, and is \none of the most talented technicians with whom he has ever worked.\u201d (AE X). According \nto another coworker, whom Applicant trained, he is a highly talented individual who \nprovided an unmatched level of support for the warfighters. (AE Y) Over the years, \nApplicant has won multiple awards for exceptional performance. (AE B, AE J, AE P; Tr. \n101-102) \n \nApplicant frequently vacations in the Philippines. During the course of his travels, \nhe has become acquainted with many people including women he dated and families he \nhelped financially. As a traveler who has visited and spent significant amounts of time in \ndeveloping countries, Applicant has witnessed abject poverty. Believing that much \nforeign aid, either from the U.S. government or from international charities, is \nsquandered by corrupt officials who govern many of these countries, Applicant finds it \nmore gratifying to assist needy people directly rather than through charitable donations. \n(Tr. 132) He is particularly interested in helping people be more self-sufficient. (Tr. 173) \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nOver the years, he has helped a family in the Philippines restore electric power \nthat had been lost after a typhoon. (Tr. 136) On another occasion, he helped repair a \nhome in the Philippines that had also been damaged in a typhoon. (AE Q at 3; AE T)   \n \nApplicant is equally committed to humanitarian assistance in the United States. \n(AE U, AE V) Several years ago, he gave $1,000 to a charity to help flood victims after a \nhurricane. In addition, on one occasion, he donated $1,000 to a U.S.-based disaster \nrelief charity. (AE U)  \n \n \nIn approximately 2008, during a visit to the Philippines, Applicant, while \nshopping, noticed a teenage girl (Acquaintance (A) 1) who appeared to be \u201cin a really \nbad way.\u201d (Tr. 208)) When he asked her what was wrong, she told him that she had not \neaten in three days. Applicant then took her to a fast-food restaurant. (GE 2 at 17)  After \nApplicant left the Philippines, he corresponded with her approximately two to three \ntimes a year via the internet.  \n \n \nApplicant returned to the Philippines in 2010. He had no contact with A1. In 2011, \nApplicant returned to the Philippines, staying approximately two to three weeks. He \nvisited A1, meeting with her for 20 to 30 minutes. In 2013, when Applicant visited the \nPhilippines, he met A1\u2019s family. Noticing that they had no electricity, and a makeshift \nroof composed of tin and bamboo leaves, Applicant helped them install electric service \nand repair the roof. (Tr. 135) During the trip, Applicant also provided financial assistance \nto A1. He helped send her to sewing school, and he paid her $2,500 in five increments \nto help her start a 7-11 style market. Since 2013, Applicant and A1 have communicated \nsporadically by phone. (GE 2 at 18) He neither had sexual intercourse with A1, nor \npropositioned her for sex. (Tr. 207) \n \n \nWhile on a vacation to the Philippines in early 2010, as referenced in the \nparagraph above, Applicant met A2. She worked at a moped rental shop and cleaned \nhomes for a living. Shortly after meeting, they began dating and became intimately \ninvolved. Applicant saw her three times over the two weeks that he was in the \nPhilippines. (Tr. 211) After leaving the Philippines, Applicant remained in touch with her \ndaily via Skype between 2010 and 2012. (GE 2 at 14)  When Applicant was dating A2, \nhe sent her approximately $300 to help pay for medical expenses. (Tr. 169)  By 2013, \nApplicant\u2019s contact with A2 had become less frequent. He has had no contact with her \nsince March 2016. (Tr. 212) \n \n \nIn either 2010 or 2011, Applicant met A3 while visiting the Philippines. She is a \nwaitress. He dated her for three to four weeks. While dating, he gave her $1,500, \nincluding gifts, money to buy a bicycle, and sewing school tuition. After returning from \nvacation, he stayed in touch with her sporadically, but stopped after realizing that she \nwas using him to get money for her family. (GE 2 at 4)  His last contact with her was in \n2011. (GE 2 at 18) \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nApplicant met A4, a prostitute, while on vacation in the Philippines in October \n2011. (Tr. 209) He paid her to have sex with him. (Tr. 209) Before leaving, he \npurchased her a refrigerator and helped her start a convenience store. (Tr. 168) After \nreturning to work, he stayed in touch with her via Skype once or twice per week. (GE 2 \nat 15; Tr. 207) Their last contact consisted of e-mail correspondence exchanged over \nthe holidays in 2013. (GE 2 at 14) \n \n \nApplicant met A5, a Filipino foreign national, on an airplane in 2011. She is the \nmother of four children and works as a house cleaner. Applicant gave her $1,700 to \nhelp her pay for a contracting agency that places clients, typically from developing \ncountries, in housecleaning jobs in wealthier countries. (Tr. 168) They never had sexual \nintercourse.  \n \n \nApplicant met A6 online. They have never subsequently met in person. (Tr. 216) \nShe has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business. (GE 2 at 17) With Applicant\u2019s help, she \nstarted a pig farming business. He invested $2,500 in the business. A6 paid him back in \nthe amount of $2,800. Three hundred dollars constituted return on investment. Applicant \nentered into this arrangement approximately six to eight months after he completed the \nsecurity clearance application. Their relationship was not intimate. \n \n \nApplicant met A7 while visiting the Philippines in February 2013. They were \nintimately involved. For seven to ten days, he enjoyed his vacation with her, shopping \nand sightseeing. (Tr. 215) He gave her $4,500 to help her start a fried chicken stand. He \ngave her this money incrementally over a period of several months. (Tr. 168) Although \nthey stay in touch periodically, they have not been romantically involved since Applicant \nfirst met her in 2013. His last contact with her was by phone in September 2018. (Tr. \n215) \n \n \nApplicant met A8 on the same trip that he met A7. He stayed in touch with her \ntwice per month electronically after returning from vacation. They have had no contact \nsince the fall of 2013. (GE 2 at 19) Their relationship was not intimate. \n \n \nApplicant met A9 while traveling to the Philippines in April 2013. She is a \nconstruction worker. Their relationship was not sexual. Applicant gave her between \n$800 and $1,600 to help pay for her diabetes treatment. (GE 2 at 17) After he returned \nfrom vacation, they initially stayed in touch several times per week via texting or Skype. \nTheir contact gradually decreased to electronic communication twice per month.  They \nare not currently in touch. \n \n \nApplicant met A10 on the same trip to the Philippines in 2013 that he met A9. \nShe is a restaurant hostess. Applicant had an intimate relationship with her. They spent \nthree days together dining out, shopping, and visiting her at her home. After Applicant \nreturned to base from vacation, they communicated electronically approximately twice a \nmonth through January 2014. (GE 2 at 17) In approximately April 2014, Applicant gave \nher $500 to help her pay her rent. (GE 2 at 17-18) \n \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nIn approximately 2014, Applicant purchased a condo in the Philippines for \n$34,000 USD. (Tr. 116) It is roughly the size of a hotel suite. (AE R) Applicant \npurchased it because, given the frequency that he visits the Philippines, it is cheaper to \nown a condo rather than to pay hotel costs for each trip. (Tr. 123) Also, the Philippines \nis \u201ca great jumping off spot to travel to other locations\u201d around the world. (Tr. 124) The \ncondo\u2019s current value is approximately $8,000 USD. (Tr. 123) Applicant does not rent it \nto anyone when he is not occupying it. (Tr. 125) \n \n \nApplicant has money deposited in seven bank accounts. Five bank accounts are \nin the United States and two of the bank accounts are in the Philippines. (Tr. 107) \nCollectively, he has approximately $8,000 USD deposited in the Philippines accounts. \nHe opened the first account to facilitate the purchase of his condo in 2014. (Tr. 111; AE \nD at 3) He uses it to pay condo fees, utilities, and property taxes. Now, he uses it for his \nvacation expenses. He opened the account, in part, to avoid exorbitant ATM conversion \nfees that his U.S. bank charges for foreign transactions. Applicant opened the second \nbank account in the Philippines to take advantage of a perk in which the bank waives \nthe $100 USD fee that the country charges foreign visitors seeking to apply for visa \nextensions. (Tr. 112) \n \n \nApplicant purchased his primary property in the United States in 2007. Because \nhe is home only once every 18 to 24 months, he generally keeps it boarded. Applicant \nrents his other two U.S. properties.  (Tr. 118) Applicant\u2019s combined annual salary and \nretirement income totals approximately $322,000.  (Tr. 103; AE D at 3) His net worth is \n1.7 million dollars. \n \n \nFor approximately four months in 2012, before taking his current job, and after \nfinishing his previous job in a combat zone, Applicant performed contract work in \nFinland. (Tr. 87) While there, he became romantically involved with a waitress who was \na citizen of Thailand. He had sex with her twice. Their relationship never became close \nbecause of their language barrier. \n \n \nIn the past, Applicant considered settling down, moving to the Philippines and \npursuing a serious relationship with a Filipino woman. Now, he is no longer interested in \nmarrying anyone from the Philippines because of the communication gap that he has \nfound which often exists between him and the women he has dated over the years. He \nno longer visits his ex-girlfriends when he travels to the Philippines. He now \nunderstands that the only reason many of them want to \u201chang out\u201d with him is because \nof the possibility that he may buy them good food and great gifts. (Tr. 140)  As for \nrelocating to the Philippines, Applicant ruled this out because his condo is too small. \nAfter living for years in a cramped, Spartan space while working on base, he prefers to \npurchase a home where he can \u201cspread his legs out.\u201d (Tr. 231) Applicant occasionally \n\u201cget[s] random contacts out of the clear blue, but there\u2019s nothing close to close and \ncontinuing happening\u201d with any of the women he has met while traveling to the \nPhilippines. (Tr. 213) \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nWhile Applicant was working in Finland, he took a ferry boat ride to Estonia and \nstayed there for two to three days. He spent the time in Estonia sightseeing. (Tr. 86, \n177)  \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in September 2012. He \nanswered \u201cno\u201d in response to Section 20B, which required him to disclose foreign \ninterests. (See Preliminary Ruling Section, supra) The SOR alleges that he failed to \ndisclose business consulting and financial support he provided to several women who \nwere citizens and residents of the Philippines. Applicant contends that whatever advice \nhe gave to Filipino women that he helped start businesses was limited to basic \ncommon-sense suggestions such as reminding them not to forget to subtract inventory \ncosts from sales revenue when calculating profit. (Tr. 173) Applicant also testified that \nany profit from their businesses was so small by U.S. standards that if he were to have \nrequested a share, it \u201cwould [have] defeat[ed] the purpose . . . of trying to help them.\u201d \n(Tr. 167)  \n \nApplicant did receive a return on his investment in the pig farming business. \nApplicant helped the Filipino woman with the pig farming venture after he completed the \nsecurity clearance application. He earned $300 from the investment. \n \nIn response to Section 20C of Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, \nregarding whether he had travelled outside of the United States in the past seven years, \nhe answered, \u201cyes.\u201d In the second question under Section 20C, asking whether the \nforeign travel was solely for Government business, Applicant also answered \u201cyes.\u201d (GE \n1 at 28) The Government alleges in SOR subparagraph 2.k that Applicant\u2019s failure to \ndisclose trips to the Philippines in 2010 and 2011, a trip to Estonia in 2012, and a trip to \nFinland in July 2012 constitutes a falsification. Applicant testified that he always \nreported his foreign travel to his supervisor per company policy, and that his facility \nsecurity officer (FSO) told him that he was only required to list travel to adversarial \ncountries. (AE M; AE Q at 2; Tr. 174-175)  \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nThe Philippine government is a multi-party, constitutional republic with a \nbicameral legislature. (HE IV at 1) The relationship between the United States and the \nPhilippines is based on a strong historical and cultural link. (HE XII) The United States \nand the Philippines maintain a robust relationship through several person-to-person \ncultural exchanges sponsored by both governments, as well as non-governmental \norganizations. (Id.) Approximately 220,000 U.S. citizens live in the Philippines. (Id.) \nManila, the capital of the Philippines, is home to the only U.S. Bureau of Veterans \nAffairs office and health care clinic outside of the United States. (HE XI at 1-2) The \nlargest U.S. cemetery outside of the United States is in the Philippines. \n \n \nManila is a high-threat location for crime directed at, or affecting U.S. government \ninterests. (HE VII at 1) The U.S. Department of State advises all U.S. citizens \ncontemplating travel to the Philippines to exercise increased caution due to crime, \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                              \nterrorism, and civil unrest. (HE VIII) Certain regions of the Philippines have been acutely \naffected by Islamic State-sponsored terrorism.  (HE V) The Philippines government has \nconsistently acknowledged the danger from such groups and has welcomed assistance \nfrom the United States. (HE V)  \n \n \nAlthough the Philippines is a democratic republic, its human rights record is poor. \nOver an 18-month period between July 2016 and October 2017, government agents \nand their informal allies arbitrarily and unlawfully killed thousands of people allegedly \nconnected to the distribution of illegal drugs. (HE IV at 2) Other problems include torture \nof prisoners, life-threatening prison conditions, arbitrary jailing of political prisoners, and \nwarrantless arrests by security forces. (HE IV at 1) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 7: \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest.  \n \n  \nThe Philippines is an ally of the United States and is a partner in fighting \nterrorism. However, terrorism and civil unrest is pervasive in parts of the country, crime \nis rampant, and the government has a history of brutally disregarding the human rights \nof its citizens in enforcing the rule of law. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with girlfriends over the years and various other people whom he has \nhelped financially, raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 7(a) applies, and Applicant\u2019s \nproperty interest in the Philippines raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 7(f) applies. \n \n  \nNone of Applicant\u2019s romantic relationships were long-term or serious. Although \nApplicant spent thousands of dollars over the years helping Filipino citizens and \nresidents, buying gifts for his then-girlfriends and helping them financially, this money \nwas minimal in relation to his total net worth. The most recent evidence of a romantic \nrelationship with a citizen and resident of the Philippines occurred approximately five \nyears ago. Any residual contact with ex-girlfriends is casual and infrequent. \nConsequently, the casual, infrequent nature of Applicant\u2019s relationship with his friends \nand acquaintances who are citizens and residents of the Philippines renders the \npossibility of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion \nminimal. AG \u00b6 7(a) does not apply. Assuming for the sake of argument that the \nconcerns about crime, terrorism, and human rights abuses in the Philippines were \nsufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 7(a), it is mitigated by AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d I resolve \nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n  \nThe value of Applicant\u2019s condo and his bank accounts in the Philippines are \nminimal in relation to the value of his properties in the United States and to his total net \nworth. Consequently, the possibility that it could create the potential for coercion, \ninfluence, or exploitation is minimal. AG \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign \nbusiness, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a \nconflict and could not be used to effectively influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual,\u201d applies. I resolve SOR subparagraph 1.d and 1.e in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n  \nA clear and accurate assessment of a country\u2019s geo-political position vis a vis the \nUnited States is crucial in a heightened risk analysis. (ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4, \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                              \nn.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007) The Government presented no such evidence about either \nThailand or Finland. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s past relationship with a \nThai citizen residing in Finland does not generate a security concern. I resolve SOR \nsubparagraph 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n  \nApplicant disclosed that he has met several women during his foreign travels on \nhis 2012 security clearance application. He identified and discussed his relationships \nwith them comprehensively during the investigative process. Consequently, I resolve \nSOR subparagraph 1.f, alleging that he failed to report association with foreign \nnationals, in his favor. In sum, Applicant has mitigated the Guideline B security concern. \n  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes.\u201d (Id.) \n \n  \nThe personal conduct security concern is not applicable to Applicant\u2019s purchase \nof property in the Philippines to use during his occasional visits because it is not \nreflective of dishonesty, untrustworthiness, or bad judgment. Any security concerns \nregarding the property were addressed under the Guideline B section above. \n \n  \nApplicant is a single man who has lived nearly continuously in combat zones for \nthe past 15 years, working seven days per week for his employer under extraordinarily \nstressful and austere conditions. These facts, together with his testimony, lead me to \nconclude that emotional fulfillment was not what Applicant was primarily seeking when \nhe entered into romantic relationships with his various paramours in the Philippines \nduring his brief vacation time over the years. Conversely, he was not intimately involved \nwith every woman he met while vacationing in the Philippines, and he assisted them \nfinancially regardless of whether he was having sexual intercourse with them. Moreover, \nhe has not had an intimate relationship with any citizens and residents of the Philippines \nin approximately five years. Applicant has a history of helping people in need, giving \n$2,000 over the years to U.S. charities to help flood victims. Under these \ncircumstances, the altruism Applicant demonstrated by helping women when visiting the \nPhilippines was not diminished by whether or not he was romantically involved with \nthem. I conclude that SOR subparagraph 2.g generates no security concern. \n \n  \nAs for Applicant\u2019s response to Section 20B of his security clearance application \nregarding foreign interests in the Philippines, Applicant\u2019s help to Philippine foreign \nnationals consisted of financial support to help them start businesses or attend trade \nschool. The advice that he has occasionally provided to them over the years was limited \nto innocuous, common-sense suggestions. Under these circumstances, I conclude that \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant did not falsify Section 20B of his security clearance application, as alleged in \nSOR subparagraph 2.j.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s FSO told him that he was only required to report foreign trips to \nadversarial countries. He always reported his foreign travel to his supervisor in advance \nof his trips. Under these circumstances, I conclude that his failure to disclose two trips to \nthe Philippines, a trip to Finland, and a trip to Estonia,  when he answered \u201cno\u201d to \nQuestion 20C regarding foreign, non-work related travel over the past seven years, did \nnot constitute a falsification, and at worst, constituted a careless, but honest mistake. In \nreaching this conclusion, I considered his explanation, together with his forthcoming \nresponses to the other security clearance application questions, and his good character. \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance for more than 35 years, and he has spent \nnearly his entire adult life serving the country, first as an enlisted Airman, and after \nretirement, as a contractor, working nearly year round in combat zones for the past 15 \nyears. While working abroad, Applicant has largely sacrificed a conventional, \ncomfortable life stateside for an ascetic life with the near-constant threat of physical \nharm. I considered these facts in assessing his credibility, and in my disposition of the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions of the alleged guidelines.  \n \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                              \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 2.g \u2013 2.k:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nMarc Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Government Exhibit 1.) On December 28, 2017, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline I \n(Psychological Conditions). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudication Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of \nDefense after June 8, 2017. \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on January 22, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on March 1, 2018. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on March \n15, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 25, 2018. The Government \noffered Government Exhibits 1 through 10, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant offered Applicant Exhibits A through C, which were admitted without objection, \nand testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on May 3, \n2018.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He is married, \nwith no children. Applicant was honorably retired from the Air Force as a technical \nsergeant (E-6) in 2001, and has an Associate of Arts degree. He is seeking to retain \nnational security eligibility for a security clearance in connection with his employment. \n(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13C, 15, 17.)  \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he suffers from an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair his \njudgment, reliability or trustworthiness.

He was brought in by police on a 5150 \nfor danger to self after patient [Applicant] cut both of his wrists superficially \nand was observed to be sitting in warm water in a bathtub. The patient \nstated, \u201cI cut a little more initially, but it didn\u2019t work. I got scared and called \nthe police.\u201d The patient stated that he had been feeling that people were \nfollowing him for the last year and a half. The patient believed they were \nmilitary personnel. The patient was unsure why they were following him, but \nthey were looking at him in the home as well as following him around \nwherever he went. The patient stated he believed he was being monitored, \n\u201cBecause I stare at children too long.\u201d . . . The patient denied auditory or \nvisual hallucinations. The patient however was preoccupied with his \ndelusions to the point of feeling that people were following him even in the \nhospital. The patient reported history of recurrent episodes of depression, \nbut no psychosis in the past. . . The patient stated that he felt that he needed \nto kill himself to save his wife.  \n \n \nThe hospital records further state, under \u201cCOURSE OF HOSPITALIZATION\u201d: \n \nThe patient demonstrated gradual improvement to his symptoms with \ntreatment. . . The patient reported significant decrease in the intensity and \nfrequency of his paranoid delusions. The patient states that he was no \nlonger bothered by them. The patient initially had thoughts of ending his life \nto save his wife. The patient, however, reported resolution of any suicidal or \nhomicidal ideations.  \n \n \nApplicant was prescribed drugs, and also advised to obtain counseling. He \ncontinues on a drug regimen, as well as counseling, as further described below. \n(Applicant Exhibits A and B.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on September 11, 2014. The investigator prepared a Report of \nInvestigation \n(ROI), \nwhich \nstated \nas \nfollows \nconcerning \nApplicant\u2019s \n\u201cPSYCHOLOGICAL/EMOTIONAL HEALTH\u201d: \n \nThe subject\u2019s anxiety stems from the constant feeling that people are \nwatching him, at work, going to the bathroom, at home, when he is driving, \nto \u201csuggest he is doing things he isn\u2019t supposed to do\u201d in order to get rid of \nhim. The subject could not elaborate on what he meant by \u201cthings he isn\u2019t \nsupposed to do.\u201d These feelings first started in about 2003 date not recalled, \nat home, then in about 2005, date not recalled, at work. The subject has \nspoken with his supervisor about his belief that people are watching him to \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nget him on something. The subject\u2019s supervisor has told the subject that no \none is trying to watch him or get things on him. The subject thinks that his \nsupervisor thinks he is \u201ca bit off.\u201d The subject has not had any disciplinary \nactions or confrontations. (See Tr. 26-27.) \n \nThe subject\u2019s counseling and medication have helped him to understand \nthat people are not out to get him, but he still can\u2019t help getting the feeling \nthat people are watching him. (Government Exhibit 2 at 2.)  \n \n \nBased in part on this interview a staff psychologist at the DoD CAF recommended \nthat Applicant receive a medical evaluation. The psychologist stated, \u201cEven in the face of \nthe very limited favorable medical testimony, a concern exists about the subject\u2019s \njudgment and reliability based upon his intrusive thoughts/anxieties he expressed to the \nOPM investigator during his 11 SEP 14 PSI [Personal Subject Interview].\u201d (Government \nExhibit 4.) \n \n \nApplicant received a psychological evaluation from a licensed psychologist/clinical \nneuropsychologist (Evaluator) on November 3 and 10, 2017. (See Tr. 36.) The \nEvaluator\u2019s report is Government Exhibit 3. Pertinent excerpts from this document are as \nfollows: \n \nCOLLATERAL INTERVIEWS (CONDUCTED BY PHONE): \n \n[Applicant] provided a signed authorization for this evaluator to speak with \nhis treating psychiatrist Dr. [A]. On November 8, 2017, Dr. [A] reported that \n[Applicant] is being treated for Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, \nsevere, with psychotic features and Delusional Disorder. He has been \ntreating [Applicant] since December 2009. Dr. [A] first began providing \ntreatment on a monthly basis and reduced it to one time every two months. \n[Applicant] is reported to be consistent with is appointments. The current \nprescribed psychotropic medications are as follows: Risperdal .5 mg, \nWellbutrin 150 mg, Lexapro 20 mg, and Klonopin .5 mg. Dr. [A] is aware of \n[Applicant\u2019s] persecutory/paranoid delusions, and reports Risperdal .5 mg \nis a low dose, but he has been unable to increase the dose due to reported \nside-effects. Dr. [A], reports Risperdal is about the only antipsychotic \nmedication that [Applicant] will tolerate. Some of the paranoid delusions that \nDr. [A] is aware of are as follows: Co-workers are talking about him, playing \ngames with him, his work is trying to fire him, he is being monitored by his \ncomputer and his telephone. Dr. [A] reports that [Applicant] is guarded and \ndoes not go into detail about the paranoid delusions. Dr. [A] reports that he \ndoes not believe that there would be a problem in [Applicant\u2019s] judgment or \nreliability in safeguarding secret/confidential information because of the \nfollowing: He has known [Applicant] for so long, he is able to perform his \njob, has been relatively free of disciplinary actions, has not been fired from \nhis job, and [Applicant] is at baseline/not deteriorating. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nBRIEF HISTORY OF RELEVENT ISSUES:   \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n. \n. \n. \n \n \nAlthough he continues to work as a . . . Assistant Site Manager, and \nhas been with the same company for many years, [Applicant] reports having \nthe following complaints (persecutory/paranoid delusions): His work is \ntrying to fire him because he stares at women too long; co-workers are \ntalking about him, playing games with him; he is being monitored by his \ncomputer and his telephone, \u201cPeople are working on getting me fired; they \ntrack how many times I look at women; security guards on the base can \nread my mind or put things in my mind.\u201d [Applicant] reports ongoing \ntreatment with Dr. [A], psychiatrist, for medication management, and [Dr. B], \nPhD, MFCC, for individual therapy. [Applicant] reports ongoing discussions, \non the above ideations, with both treatment providers. Dr. [A] reports he is \naware of the above delusions.  \n \n \nPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION/TESTING RESULTS:  \n \nMental Status Exam: . . . [Applicant] reported suffering stress due to people \nat his work trying to get him fired . . . No obvious or unusual anxiety \nsymptoms were noticed, beyond closing his eyes when reporting paranoid \nideations. [Applicant\u2019s] thought process was linear; his thought content was \nirrational when discussing paranoid delusions; thought content was relevant \nto the topic being discussed. . . . \n \nPersonality Assessment Inventory (PAI): This evaluator administered the \nPAI to [Applicant], which resulted in a valid profile, validity indices were well \nwithin the normal range, suggesting that he answered in a consistent \nmanner, attended appropriately to the item content, and had an ability to \nidentify positive and negative qualities/attributes about himself. \n \n[Applicant] elevated several of the clinical scales, indicating that he suffers \nfrom significant anxiety, depression, and psychotic symptoms. The most \nsignificantly elevated clinical scales suggest that [Applicant] is hypervigilant \nand overly suspicious; he spends much time monitoring his environment for \nevidence that others are trying to harm or discredit him. He also has \npersecutory beliefs that people are plotting against him in some sort of \nconspiracy (e.g., \u201cPeople want to fire me\u201d). People may view him as odd \nand eccentric, due to his hypervigilance and unconventional ideas. As a \nresult of his paranoid ideations (e.g., \u201cSecurity guards on base can read my \nmind and put things in my mind\u201d) and related anxiety, he socially isolates \nand detaches, which may serve to decrease his social discomfort. \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n. \n. \n. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nAlthough he is not aware that many of his thoughts are delusional in nature, \nhe acknowledges that he has major emotional difficulties and believes he \nneeds help.  \n \n \nBased on the foregoing, under the section \u201cDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS,\u201d the \nEvaluator found the following diagnoses, which are consistent with those of Dr. A, set \nforth above: Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with psychotic features; and, \nDelusional Disorder, Persecutory Type.  \n \n \nThe report concludes: \n \nIMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS \n \nLong-term prognosis is fair if [Applicant] is willing/able to tolerate an \nincrease \nin \nRisperdal \n(or \nanother \nantipsychotic \nmedication \nas \nrecommended by Dr. [A]). In the past, [Applicant] adhered to a higher dose \nof Risperdal, resulting in an improved mental state and stability. However, \nat this time, [Applicant\u2019s] immediate prognosis is poor. He continues to have \nsignificant paranoid delusions, depressed mood, anxiety, and periodic \nsuicide ideation. Insight into his delusions is currently poor. There is \ncurrently significant interpersonal functional impairment in [Applicant\u2019s] life. \nHe also has a history of occupational difficulties (e.g., Unable to work as a \nresult of psychiatric hospitalization in 2009, security clearance was revoked \nin 2009) without mental health treatment. Without an increase in Risperdal \n(or another antipsychotic), his prognosis is likely to remain poor. \n \nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS \n \nAt this time, [Applicant\u2019s] current mental state and functioning impacts his \nability, reliability, judgment, stability and trustworthiness in handling or \nsafeguarding classified information. I agree with Dr. [A] that [Applicant] is \nable to perform his job, and does not have a history of aggression or being \nfired from his place of employment. However, [Applicant] is not in touch with \nreality, at this time, due to his continued paranoid delusions; furthermore, \nhe continues to experience depression and anxiety, and periodic suicide \nideation; this dysregulation of neurotransmitters could affect the frontal \nlobes, and areas involved in decision making and metacognition. As a result \nof his current mental state, and poor insight, there is significant concern that \n[Applicant] could pose a risk of unauthorized disclosure or mishandling of \nclassified information.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. A, provided a written statement dated April 23, \n2018. It is Applicant Exhibit A and reads as follows: \n \nPlease be advised that [Applicant] has been under my psychiatric care since \n12/15/2009 for the medication management of major depression with \npsychotic features and the delusional disorder, persecutory type. He is seen \nevery one to two months for medication management and his current \nmedications are Lexapro 20 mg at bedtime, Zyprexa 2.5 mg at bedtime and \nKlonopin 0.5 mg as needed.2 [Applicant] attends his sessions regularly and \nhas \nbeen \ncompliant \nwith \nthe \nrecommendations \nfor \nmedication \nmanagement.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that his psychiatrist had changed his prescription from Risperdal \nto Zyprexa because of some suicidal thoughts he was having. He also thought that Dr. A \nput him on Zyprexa because of the recommendation from the Evaluator that Applicant\u2019s \nmedication either be changed or increased. (Tr. 37-38.) \n \n \nApplicant also has a treating psychologist, Dr. B, who also submitted a written \nstatement, dated March 22, 2018. He has been seeing Applicant since approximately \n2005. (Tr. 25, 38-39.) The statement is Applicant Exhibit B and reads as follows: \n \nI am writing this letter to confirm that [Applicant] has been in individual \ncounseling with me. [Applicant] has been showing good progress in dealing \nwith his anxiety issues. We have been utilizing Cognitive Behavioral \nTherapy and Solution Focused Therapy as the basis for affecting change in \nhis life. [Applicant] reports improvement in dealing with the stressors of his \nlife. He is a very willing and cooperative client who has an excellent \nprognosis. \n \n \nApplicant testified concerning his issues at some length. He confirmed that his \nissues began in 2004 or 2005 with a constant feeling that people were watching him at \nwork, while going to the bathroom, at home, while he was driving, and suggesting that he \nwas doing things he wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing. Applicant testified that he continued to \nhave these feelings today about his fellow workers. He also believed at the time of the \nhearing that such observation was being done covertly by his management and \ninvestigators, though not as much as during earlier days. (Tr. 24-32.)  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 I take administrative notice of the following facts concerning the drugs that are currently prescribed for \nApplicant. Lexapro is an anti-depressant. (WebMD, Lexapro, https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-\n63990/lexapro-oral/details (accessed December 28, 2018).) Zyprexa is an anti-psychotic. (WebMD, \nZyprexa, https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1699/zyprexa-oral/details (accessed December 28, \n2018).)  Klonopin is used to treat panic disorder and anxiety. (WebMD, Klonopin, https://www.webmd.com/ \ndrugs/2/drug-920-6006/klonopin-oral/clonazepam-oral/details (accessed December 28, 2018).) \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not believe the security guards at work were reading \nhis mind and putting thoughts in his head. He further testified: \n \nThere\u2019s this one Security outfit that has some kind of device or something, \nif you\u2019ve seen on the news and whatnot. They\u2019ve had ways where they can \ngo, where people can go and use hearing \u2013 brain-connecting hearing aids \n\u2013 to brain waves so deaf people can hear and whatnot. So, it\u2019s not really a \nstretch for those same waves to be \u2013 if they have the right frequency \u2013 could \ngo and listen and understand them. (Tr. 46.) \n \n \nHe was asked by me, \u201cAnd you believe this is happening with you?\u201d Applicant \nresponded, \u201cIt happened yes.\u201d I also asked him, \u201cIs it currently happening, or in the past?\u201d \nApplicant stated, \u201cIn the past, yes, Your Honor.\u201d (Ibid.) \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a letter of recommendation from a retired member of the Air \nForce who knows Applicant well. The writer met Applicant at church, believes Applicant \nto be a trustworthy person, and recommends him to receive national security eligibility. \n(Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 39-40.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in \u00a7 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, \u00a7 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions) \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \n \n \nApplicant has been suffering from several diagnosed, severe, mental health \nconditions since at least 2009. He was psychiatrically hospitalized at that time because \nof a suicide attempt. His diagnosed conditions include major depression with psychotic \nfeatures, and a delusional disorder, persecutory type. These delusions are specifically \nrelated to his work, where he believes he is being covertly watched, that his management \nis conspiring against him, and that a security outfit has been able to use a device to read \nhis mind and put ideas into his head. Applicant testified about his delusions, which he \ncontinues to believe. In addition, Government Exhibit 3 is an extensive report from a DoD-\napproved mental health consultant who opined that Applicant\u2019s conditions are not under \ncontrol and may impair his judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nAfter evaluating all the available evidence, I find that none of these mitigating \nconditions apply with force enough to overcome the weight of evidence. First, it must be \nunderstood that there is no allegation that Applicant has ever mishandled classified \ninformation. However, that is not the determining factor in this case. \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \n \nMitigating condition \u00b6 29(a) does not apply because there is little to no evidence \nthat Applicant\u2019s condition is controllable with treatment. He is compliant with the treatment \nplan, but the evidence shows that he is still subject to delusions. \n \n \nMitigating condition \u00b6 29(b) does not supply sufficient mitigation because there is \nlittle evidence that the counseling Applicant is receiving has resulted in a relevant \nfavorable prognosis by either of his mental health professionals. The Government is \nconcerned with Applicant\u2019s diagnosed delusions and depressive psychosis. The letter \nfrom Dr. A merely stated that Applicant is medication compliant. Dr. B\u2019s letter stated that \nApplicant has an \u201cexcellent prognosis.\u201d However, it is noted that the letter also stated that \nApplicant is being treated by Dr. B for \u201canxiety issues,\u201d which are distinct from the \ndepressive, psychotic, and delusional mental health concerns diagnosed by the \npsychiatrist.  \n \n \nMitigating conditions \u00b6 29(c) does not apply because the Evaluator had specific \nconcerns about Applicant, set forth in Government Exhibit 3, which have not been \nanswered. He found that Applicant\u2019s condition is not under control or remission, and that \nthere was a high probability of exacerbation. \n \n \nFinally, mitigating condition \u00b6 29(e) does not apply. Based on the report of the \nEvaluator, and Applicant\u2019s testimony, there is more than sufficient evidence of a current \nproblem. \n \n \nThe simple fact is that Applicant does not currently meet the conditions for a \ngranting of national security eligibility. There is always the possibility that his condition will \nstabilize, and that he will receive a favorable prognosis specifically concerning his \ndiagnoses of major depression with psychotic features, and delusional disorder, \npersecutory type. Until that happens, he is not eligible. Paragraph 1 is found against \nApplicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n \n12 \n \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his psychological conditions, which are involuntary but serious and \nlikely to continue. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant=s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility, and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n                                                \n \n \n \n \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n",

DOD acted under \nDOD acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 17, 2017, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Applicant was separated from employment on April 19, 2018, \nand processing of the case was terminated for lack of jurisdiction.  \n1 Applicant married after the Statement of Reasons (SOR) was issued. This decision is captioned with her \nmarried name instead of the name reflected in the SOR. \n01/30/2019\n\n2 \n \nApplicant was employed by another defense contractor on November 7, 2018, and \nthe case was reopened and assigned to me on November 15, 2018. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a notice of hearing on November 26, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for December 19, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without \nobjection. I kept the record open until January 11, 2019, to enable her to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. She timely submitted AX B through I, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 4, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f. \nShe did not admit or deny the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Her admissions have \nbeen incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since November 2018. She has never held a security clearance or \neligibility for a public trust position. \n \n \nApplicant attended college from October 2000 to September 2001 and received a \ncertificate of completion for training as a legal office assistant. She attended college from \nJanuary 2006 to August 2007 and October 2009 to September 2011 but did not receive \na degree. She has student loans totaling about $74,000, on which deferment ended in \nDecember 2018. (Tr. 69.) The student loans are not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant married in July 2011. (GX 1 at 6.) Around December 2011, her husband \nleft her. She filed for divorce in 2012, and the divorce was final in May 2014. She has an \n11-year-old daughter from her previous marriage, for whom she receives child-support \npayments of $800 per month. She also has a 15-year-old son from a previous relationship, \nfor whom she receives child support of $147 per month. She remarried in 2017 and has \na 19-month-old daughter from this marriage. (GX 2 at 2-3; Tr. 30-31.) \n \n \nApplicant has worked for federal contractors since at least February 2002 as a \nreceptionist, technical assistant, executive assistant, administrative specialist, human-\nresources specialist, performance-management analyst, and payroll time-and- \nattendance specialist. She was unemployed from June to November 2011, when her \nemployer\u2019s contract ended. Her previous jobs did not offer medical insurance, and she \nincurred debts for medical care. She had a full-time day job and worked at full-time night \njobs at fast-food restaurants during the summer of 2012. She worked part time at a fast-\nfood restaurant for three months in 2012 or 2013. (GX 2 at 2.) In each case, she quit her \nnight job because she was physically unable to work two jobs. \n \n \nApplicant purchased a home in 2005 with an adjustable-rate mortgage. Her \nhusband\u2019s pay was reduced when he was moved from a supervisory position to a lower-\n                                                          \n2 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her application for a public trust position (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n3 \n \npaying non-supervisory position. (Tr. 46.) They filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nSeptember 2007 because they could not afford to pay the mortgage loan and could not \nobtain a loan modification. The bankruptcy also included her then husband\u2019s car loan, \nmedical bills, and her then husband\u2019s credit-card debt. They received a discharge in June \n2009. About $259,000-$280,000 was discharged. (GX 2 at 5; Tr. 32.) \n \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s first husband left her, she remained in the marital home, which \nshe had purchased in July 2010. Her mother, who has since passed away, also was living \nwith and supported by her. Applicant stayed in the marital home for about two months, \nmoved in with a friend, and then sold the marital home in a short sale. The credit report \nfrom April 2017 reflects that the mortgage loan was paid. (GX 4 at 1.) Her friend was \nretired military and employed full time. They agreed to split their living expenses, but \nApplicant found herself paying most of the expenses. She could not afford to move out, \nand so she continued to live with her friend for about two years. (Tr. 37-39.)  \n \nAround 2015, Applicant began living with a co-worker, and they married in 2017. \n(Tr. 30.) Her current husband is retired military and she is entitled to military medical \nbenefits as a military family member. Her current husband has given her financial \nguidance and has joined her in managing the family finances. (Tr. 40-41.) She testified \nthat her husband has prepared a spreadsheet for her, setting out a plan to resolve her \ndelinquent debts. It lists specific creditors and specific payment amounts to each creditor. \nShe did not submit the spreadsheet at the hearing. She promised to submit a copy of it, \nbut it was not included in her post-hearing submission. (Tr. 75-76.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a delinquent car loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b), and five medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g). The bankruptcy and delinquent \ndebts are reflected in credit reports from November 2018 (GX 3), April 2017 (GX 4), and \nOctober 2014 (GX 5.)  \n \nThe allegations of delinquent medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g do not comply with \nthe requirement for specificity in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.3, which requires that the SOR \u201cshall be \nas detailed and comprehensive as the national security permits.\u201d The SOR does not \nidentify the creditors or collection agents and provides no account numbers. The April \n2017 credit report on which they are based lists only the date each account was opened. \nHowever, Applicant was able to track down each of these medical debts. The evidence \nconcerning the delinquent debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: delinquent car loan charged off for $10,375. Applicant testified that \nthis debt was jointly incurred during her previous marriage. (Tr. 47.) The account was \nopened in December 2011, and the debt was charged off in June 2014. (GX 3 at 5; GX 5 \nat 3.) In a personal subject interview (PSI) in November 2014, Applicant told an \ninvestigator that she was negotiating with this creditor. She admitted this debt in her \nanswer to the SOR and stated that she would resolve it after she resolved other smaller \ndebts. At the hearing, she testified that she contacted the creditor and was offered a \nsettlement for $8,000, but she could not afford to accept it. (Tr. 47-48.) She did not provide \nany documentary evidence of the settlement offer. In her post-hearing submission, she \nasserted that this creditor informed her that it would not attempt to collect this debt \n\n4 \n \nbecause it is barred by the statute of limitations. (AX D.) She provided no documentary \nevidence to support her assertion regarding the statute of limitations.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: medical debt for eye surgery, past due for $172. This debt was \nincurred in December 2014, and the last payment was in March 2015. (GX 3 at 6; GX 4 \nat 2.) The total amount due on this debt is $2,826. (GX 4 at 2.) Applicant underwent laser \nsurgery after her vision declined and she began wearing glasses. She decided that the \nsurgery made more financial sense than paying for new glasses whenever her vision \nchanged. (Tr. 51.) Applicant has promised to make biweekly $75 payments beginning on \nJanuary 19, 2019. (AX I.) As of the date the record closed, she had not made any \npayments.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d: medical debt for $651. This debt was incurred when Applicant went \nto an emergency room after an automobile accident in 2013. She testified that she \ndisputed the amount of the debt because she left the emergency room for an unspecified \npersonal emergency before being treated. She settled the debt for a lesser amount on \nNovember 30, 2018, after she received the SOR. (AX A; Tr. 53-54.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: medical debt for $331. This debt was paid in full on September 28, \n2017, after Applicant received the SOR. (AX H.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: medical debt for $156. This debt was paid in full in March 2016. (AX \nG.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: medical debt for $47. This debt was paid in full on January 9, 2017. \n(AX F.) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual pay is about $96,000, which is a substantial increase from her \nprevious job, which paid $65,000 per year. Her take-home pay ranges from about $2,000 \nto $2,300. She has no savings. (Tr. 80.) Her husband is retired military, and his annual \npay is about $104,000. (Tr. 80.) Applicant does not know how much he receives in military \nretired pay. Her husband has four children from his previous marriage and pays child \nsupport for two of them. He also is still jointly liable for the mortgage payments on his \nprevious marital home. (Tr. 88.) Applicant\u2019s rent is $2,700. She pays $1,700, and her \nhusband pays $1,000, plus the utilities. They have a monthly car payment of $554. (Tr. \n67.) She did not provide any other information about her monthly living expenses. \n \n \nApplicant testified that she did not contact the various creditors alleged in the SOR \nuntil recently, because she did not have sufficient income to make payments, and she did \nnot want to make a payment agreement that she would be unable to afford. (Tr. 86.) Her \ncurrent employment contract is for three years, and she is confident that her income will \nnot decrease during the duration of the contract and may increase. (Tr. 83.) \n \nPolicies \n \nADP positions are sensitive positions, and applicants for ADP positions are entitled \nto the procedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \n\n5 \n \ndetermination may be made. The standard for assignment to sensitive duties is that the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.   \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \n\n6 \n \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to \ndo so\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \nrecent, and the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were not incurred under \ncircumstances making them unlikely to recur. The medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-\n1.g are less likely to recur, because Applicant\u2019s recent marriage entitles her to military \nmedical benefits. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy. It was caused by \nher then husband\u2019s pay reduction and upward adjustment in her mortgage-loan \npayments, which were conditions largely beyond her control. Under the circumstances, \nfiling a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition was a prudent decision.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established for the debts incurred after Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. \nHer marital breakup and the resulting income reduction, unemployment from June to \nNovember 2011, unemployment from April to November 2018, and uninsured medical \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g were conditions largely beyond her control. However, \nher medical debt for laser surgery alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was voluntarily incurred. The \n\n7 \n \nrecord does not reflect why her employment was terminated in April 2018, but there is no \nevidence that it was voluntary or due to any misconduct.  \n \nHowever, Applicant has not acted responsibly regarding the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. The car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b was incurred in December 2011, while \nshe was employed, and she acted responsibly for a while by working second jobs in 2012 \nand 2013. However, she stopped making payments in June or July 2014, well before she \nlost her job in April 2018. She has provided no documentary evidence of any efforts to \nresolve the debt, except for her reliance on a statute of limitations. She provided no \nevidence of efforts to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c until after the hearing, and she has \nmade no payments on the debt. She did not resolve the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d and 1.e until after she received the SOR.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Other than the financial counseling required by the \nbankruptcy court in 2008, she presented no evidence of financial counseling, and her \nfinancial situation is not under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, \nwhich Applicant resolved before she received the SOR. She claimed that the creditor \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b told her that it would not attempt to collect the debt because it was \nbarred by the statute of limitations, but she submitted no evidence to support her claim. \nFurthermore, reliance on the non-collectability because of a statute of limitations does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt. ISCR Case No. 11-08274 (App. Bd. May \n2, 2013).  \n \nApplicant submitted a specific plan to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but she \nsubmitted no evidence that the creditor had agreed to the plan and no evidence of any \npayments under the plan. Her resolution of the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and \n1.e after she received the SOR does not amount to a good-faith effort. Evidence of past \nirresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for \na public trust position. An applicant who does not resolve debts until an application for a \npublic trust position is in jeopardy may lack the good judgment expected of those with \naccess to sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) \nciting ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017).  \n \nApplicant has made some progress in attaining financial stability, tracking down \nand resolving several medical debts. However, she has not established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility. She testified that she had a plan to resolve all her debts and that \nthe plan was laid out in a detailed spreadsheet, but she did not submit it at the hearing or \nin her post-hearing submission.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant claimed that she disputed the amount of \nthe medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but she provided no documentation to support her \nclaim. However, she eventually settled the debt. She has not disputed any of the other \ndebts alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public \ntrust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).3  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns \nraised by her delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant her eligibility for a public \ntrust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for a public trust position is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 58-year-old industrial security specialist employed by a U.S. defense contractor since June 2016. He has been employed in related positions since February 1999, with periods of unemployment from January-June 2011 and January-June 2016. He has previously had favorable background investigations in June 2002 and July 2009. This is a periodic reinvestigation of that clearance (GE 1). The SOR alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits six delinquent debts totaling over $122,000. The debts comprise a $20,619 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax lien filed in May 2010, and five delinquent education loans 3 totaling $101,629. Applicant obtained the education loans to pay for his children\u2019s college expenses. Applicant disclosed the fact, but not the amount, of the tax lien on his August 2014 clearance application (GE 1). He did not disclose any delinquent education loans on his clearance application, but discussed them with a Government investigator during a February 2015 interview (GE 2) based on an August 2014 credit report (GE 4).

Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the\n2\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 20\nJuly 2017 and I convened a hearing 30 August 2017. DOHA received the transcript 7\nSeptember 2017, and the record closed.\nConsisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-4, and hearing exhibit (HE) I.\n1\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. However, on 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8\nJune 2017. My decision is the same under both guidelines.\n1\n   12/17/2018\n\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations.

The debts comprise a $20,619 Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) tax lien filed in May 2010,  and five delinquent education loans\n3\ntotaling $101,629. Applicant obtained the education loans to pay for his children\u2019s\ncollege expenses. Applicant disclosed the fact, but not the amount, of the tax lien on his\nAugust 2014 clearance application (GE 1). He did not disclose any delinquent education\nloans on his clearance application, but discussed them with a Government investigator\nduring a February 2015 interview (GE 2) based on an August 2014 credit report (GE 4).\nApplicant\u2019s July 2016 credit report (GE 3) reflects the education loan amounts alleged in\nthe SOR. Applicant\u2019s January 2017 Answer contains a December 2016 loan account\nstatement showing a $103,546 combined principal balance.  \n4\nApplicant attributed his financial problems to being laid off in January 2011. At\nthe time, he was making $145,000-150,000 annually, and was generally not having any\nproblems keeping up with his financial obligations. He received an unstated amount of\nseverance pay (GE 2). He was unemployed until June 2016, when he obtained\nemployment paying $125,000 annually. In January 2012, he obtained a different job,\nearning $128,000 annually. In January 2016, he resigned that position, and remained\nunemployed until June 2016, when he obtained his current position, earning $124,000\nannually (Tr. 41).\nApplicant did not explain why he had Federal income tax liens filed against him in\n2010, only that his January 2011 layoff made it difficult for him to keep up his payment\nplan, which he otherwise did not document. Similarly, during his February 2015\ninterview, he claimed to have just arranged a repayment plan on his education loans, to\npay $120 monthly. He could not recall the start or payoff dates for his repayment plan\n(GE 2). At hearing, he claimed, without corroboration to be paying $1,000 monthly\nthrough direct withdrawal for about the last six months (Tr. 35-36).\nApplicant had two other tax liens filed in 2010, which were satisfied (GE 4). Also not alleged in the SOR,\n3\nApplicant had state tax garnishments issued against him in March and July 2013, which were satisfied. He\nhad a June 2014 garnishment order for $91,464.12 in delinquent education loans. In June 2014, he had a\n$27,826 IRS levy for tax years 2005-2007 (GE 2). Applicant provided no independent documentation of his\ncurrent tax status.\nThe account statement showed no past-due amounts. The $1,100 January monthly payment included unpaid\n4\nfees, not otherwise specified. \n2\n\nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a\nbudget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence of community\ninvolvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.5\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant failed to fully mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s unresolved May 2010\nIRS tax lien highlights ongoing tax issues which Applicant has neither explained nor\ndocumented any resolution of. These issues appear to predate his January 2011 layoff,\nand the subsequent decline in income explains only the difficulty meeting any\nrepayment obligations undertaken, not the need for a repayment plan. Similarly, the\ndecline in income explains why the education loans fell delinquent, but does not\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n3\n\ndocument any repayment efforts undertaken upon regaining employment, albeit at\nreduced salary.6\nApplicant \nonly \npartially \nmeets \nthe \nmitigating \nconditions \nfor \nfinancial\nconsiderations. The precipitating layoff occurred over six years ago, not recent, and the\ncircumstances are not likely to recur.  However, while the circumstances of that layoff\n7\nwere beyond his control,  he has not documented that he behaved responsibly under\n8\nthe circumstances. As early as February 2015, Applicant claimed to have taken steps to\nresolve his IRS and education loan issues, but aside from a single data point in\nDecember 2016, he has not documented the claimed regular payments on his\neducation loans or documented any actions taken regarding the IRS lien.9\n \nApplicant has neither claimed nor documented any credit or financial counseling,\nand there is a dearth of evidence to show that his financial problems have been\nresolved or are under control.  This failure of evidence precludes a conclusion that\n10\nApplicant has made a good-faith effort to address his debts.  Moreover, he submitted\n11\nno work or character evidence which might support a whole-person assessment to\novercome the security concerns raised by his conduct. I conclude Guideline F against\nApplicant.\n Formal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history\n6\nof not meeting financial obligations; (e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible\nspending . . . ;\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n7\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \nBut not so his January 2016 resignation from his job, the financial impact of which Applicant did not\n8\ndocument.\n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n9\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . .  and there are clear indications\n10\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n11\nresolve debts.\n4\n\nConclusion\nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n Statement of the Case \nOn August 26, 2014, and August 3, 2017, Applicant submitted security clearance \napplications (SCA). On March 6, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 23, 2018, and he provided four documents \nwith his response. He admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.f, and denied \u00b6 1.a.   \nApplicant obtained counsel and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel provided discovery and an amendment to the SOR to Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n2 \n \n \nCounsel by letter dated November 5, 2018. The amendment included SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - 1.n; \nall falsification allegations cited under Guideline E. On November 30, 2018, Applicant \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - 1.n. On December 31, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for January 17, 2019. \nOn January 4, 2019, the case was assigned to me. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibit (GE) 1-14, \nbut only GE 1-10 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s Counsel \nobjected to GE 11-14, as noted under Procedural Matters addressed below. In addition, \nCounsel offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) B, C, E, F, G, and L,1 which I admitted into \nevidence without objection. (Tr. 26-32) Applicant called his wife to testify on his behalf. I \nheld the record open until February 17, 2019, in the event either party wanted to submit \nadditional documentation. On January 22, 2019, Applicant\u2019s counsel provided two \nadditional documents. I admitted AE M and N into evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 28, 2019, and the record was closed on \nFebruary 17, 2019. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel objected to GE 11-14, which are reports of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground interviews during various security clearance investigations. Applicant\u2019s \nCounsel believed the reports of subject interview were incomplete reports, and claimed \nthe falsification allegations were taken out of context. Department Counsel stated that \nthe subject interview reports were complete summary reports, but Applicant\u2019s Counsel\u2019s \nclaim of \u201cstatements taken out of context\u201d was due to him not receiving Applicant\u2019s \nentire report of investigation. (ROI) She correctly noted that DOHA is not authorized to \nprovide the entire ROI since it is the property of Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM). I reviewed GE 11-14, and I determined that the summary of Applicant\u2019s \ninterview was complete in all four documents. The summary covered the beginning, \nmiddle, and the end of Applicant\u2019s interview, without any missing pages. Of course, the \ninterviews are summaries and are not verbatim. They do not provide complete \ninformation from the interviews. I also advised Applicant\u2019s Counsel to clearly state \nduring Applicant\u2019s testimony if there were any discrepancies in the summary of the \nbackground interviews, which I would take into consideration. (Tr. 20-25) \n \n \nThe subject interview summary is an investigative report produced by OPM, a \nFederal government agency. OPM is required to complete subject interviews in the \nDOD security clearance investigations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are of a party opponent \nand according to Federal Rule of Evidence (Fed. R. Evid.) 801(d)(2), they are not \nhearsay. In the alternative, the summary is admissible as a record of a regularly \nrecurring activity\u2013in this case a security clearance investigation under Fed. R. Evid. \n803(6). ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2019). [Except OPM \ninvestigative records. See n. 3.] Thus, I overruled Counsel\u2019s objection to the four subject \n                                                          \n1 Some tabs from Applicant\u2019s notebook of exhibits were removed prior to the hearing. The notebook \ncontained a table of contents, but not all of the tabs listed in the table of contents were included in the \nnotebook that was provided to me at the hearing. \n\n \n3 \n \n \ninterview summaries of Applicant. I admitted GE 11-14 into evidence, and I have \naccorded the facts therein the appropriate weight given the record as a whole.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  Applicant is 38 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005, and \na master\u2019s degree in 2007. Applicant was married in 2003 and divorced in 2009. He \nremarried in 2009. He has a daughter, age 12, and an adult stepdaughter, age 21. \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in March 2003. He was on active duty until \nDecember 2005, when he received an honorable discharge due to hardship. He joined \nthe Navy Reserve in February 2010, and in October 2012, he resigned his commission \ndue to a pending Federal investigation. While serving as a government contracting \nofficer in Iraq, Applicant had been accused of setting up a sham company, bribery, and \nreceiving monetary kickbacks for awarding contacts to companies involved in the \nscheme. He could not be promoted in the Navy Reserves while a Federal investigation \nwas on-going, and he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 12-14, 33, 38, 42, 46-48, \n77-78, 119, 121-122; GE 1, GE 3-6; AE M, AE N) \n \nSince 2012, Applicant is the chief executive officer and 51% service disabled \nveteran owner of a federal consulting company that has 150 employees and does $10 \nmillion in business annually. He manages many different operations in the company. \nApplicant does not currently possess a DOD security clearance, but he previously held \na DOD security clearance and a DOD facility clearance until 2015. Applicant is \nrequesting that he be granted a personal DOD security clearance, and as Key \nManagement Personnel, his company could then be granted a DOD facility clearance. \n(Tr. 12-14, 33, 38, 46-49, 77-78; GE 1) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.a alleges that in 2009, while Applicant was working as a U.S. \nGovernment Contracting Officer in Iraq, he was investigated for bribery and conspiracy \nto commit bribery. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied this allegation, and also \nnoted that this adverse information occurred a decade ago. On May 18, 2015, Applicant \nreceived notice via certified mail from the U.S. Army Procurement Fraud Division that \nafter completion of a Federal investigation, Applicant and his company were being \nconsidered for debarment from future contracting with any agency in the Executive \nbranch of the U.S. Government. (AE M) He denied receiving any notice from the \nGovernment. He found out about the proposed debarment from his business partner, \nwho had checked the website listing debarred federal contractors and individuals. (Tr. \n97-98) Applicant obtained counsel, disputed the findings of the investigation, and \nargued that debarment was not appropriate in this matter. (AE N) On February 25, \n2016, the U.S. Army Procurement Fraud Division agreed to establish an administrative \ncompliance agreement, and required Applicant to take a business ethics course. (SOR \nresponse attachment 2)  A Memorandum from the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI), dated August 6, 2012, stated that although there was not \nenough corroboration obtained during the investigation to charge Applicant with bribery, \nand attempted bribery, the case agents from FBI, Defense Criminal Investigative \n\n \n4 \n \n \nServices, Army Criminal Investigation Command, and Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction believe that Applicant was involved in criminal activity. (Tr. 95-102; GE \n3-7; AE C, AE M, AE N)  \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.b alleges that in 2011, while Applicant was employed as an \nemployee of the United States Peace Corps, he accessed pornographic websites on his \nassigned government computer. Applicant admitted this allegation in his response to the \nSOR. He stated that he had just filed a complaint with the Office of Inspector General \n(OIG) against his supervisor for selling illegal drugs to Peace Corps employees, \nnepotism, and possible contract fraud. She also discriminated against military members. \nApplicant testified that his supervisor asked him directly if he wanted to be part of a \ncontract bribery scam. After hearing her offer, Applicant admitted to being \nunprofessional, and he said some curse words to his supervisor. He claimed his \nsupervisor then placed him on a performance improvement plan. (PIP) About three \nweeks after he filed an OIG complaint against his supervisor, a computer check \nrevealed that Applicant had been visiting pornography websites on his work computer. \nThere were also allegations of him reporting to work late and leaving work early. \nApplicant was called into an office with an OIG representative, and he signed the \npaperwork that was provided to him. He said the paper included an admission of guilt, \nwhich he agreed to sign since he was guilty of accessing pornographic websites on his \nwork computer. Applicant noted that he signed the paperwork without the benefit of \nhaving legal representation. (Tr. 60-70)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his employment with \nthe U.S. Peace Corps when he completed his 2014 SCA. Applicant denied this \nallegation, and believes the omission was either a computer glitch, the result of a \u201cgag \norder\u201d he thought was in effect, or just oversite. SOR \u00b6 1.m alleges that during his \nbackground interview in September 2014, Applicant volunteered information about his \nemployment with the U.S. Peace Corps. When initially asked by the investigator \nwhether he had any difficulties with this employment, Applicant denied any difficulties, \nand said no one from the Peace Corps would question his conduct or behavior at this \nemployment. He did not violate any oral, written or otherwise recorded agreements \nmade with this employer. He admitted to the investigator that he clicked on links \nprovided by his father which, unbeknownst to him, turned out to be pornographic \nwebsites. At the hearing, Applicant accepted full responsibility for intentionally visiting \npornographic websites on his government computer. He did not disclose on his SCA \nthat he was terminated for accessing pornography on his government computer. (Tr. 70-\n73, 102-103, 107-108, 124-127; 136-137, 139; GE 2, GE 11; AE L) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n alleges that Applicant intentionally lied to the investigator during his \nbackground interview in September 2014 when he told the investigator that he had been \nemployed by the Peace Corps, but he was under a gag order and could no longer \ndiscuss his employment with the Peace Corps during his interview. Applicant stated that \nhe believed the gag order was valid, and he was required to keep his \u201cmouth shut.\u201d (Tr. \n70-73, 102-103,109,136; GE 2, GE 11; AE L)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges that Applicant falsified his 2017 SCA when he answered \u201cno\u201d \nto the question if within the last seven years, had he ever received a written warning, \nbeen officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace. \nApplicant denied this allegation. He believed he was under a \u201cgag order\u201d and could not \ndisclose any information about his misconduct while employed by the U.S. Peace \nCorps. He claimed paragraph 3, of an unsigned settlement agreement, (AE L) was the \ndriving force in this matter. Applicant said he also knew this adverse information was \nreadily available during his investigation, so he was not attempting to hide this \ninformation. Later during the hearing, Applicant stated that he did not know the exact \ntime period, and going back 7 years, he should have listed his misconduct for viewing \npornography while employed by the Peace Corps, but he mistakenly missed the seven-\nyear cut-off by \u201cdays.\u201d Applicant did not list his termination from the Peace Corps for \nviewing pornography on the SCA. He stated he was not trying to hide the information. \nAfter reading Paragraph 3 of AE L, I find that it does not contain any language which \nwould prevent Applicant from discussing his Peace Corps employment misconduct \nduring the course of his background investigation. (Tr. 60-73, 104, 129, 140-14; GE 1, \nGE 2; AE L, paragraph 3)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges Applicant falsified material facts during a December 2011 \nsubject interview when he told the investigator that he was under a gag order as a result \nof a lawsuit he filed against the Peace Corps. He had filed a complaint against the \nPeace Corps and the matter was settled out of court. He could not provide additional \ninformation, due to a gag order issued by the presiding judge. (GE 14) In addition, \nApplicant deliberately withheld the circumstances that led to him being placed on paid \nadministrative leave, due to viewing pornographic websites on his government \ncomputer. Applicant testified that he has always admitted his misconduct of viewing \npornography whenever questioned, and also admitted he lost his employment position \ndue to viewing pornography. Later in the hearing, Applicant said he was not forthcoming \nwith his pornography misconduct due to the gag order, and he recommended the \ninvestigator obtain his employment history directly from the Peace Corps. (Tr. 73-75, \n105, 113) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.l alleges that Applicant gave conflicting accounts during his \nbackground interviews concerning the circumstances of viewing pornography on his \nwork computer. During his March 2012 interview, Applicant told the investigator that he \nhad looked at pornographic sites on his Government computer when he was on his \npersonal e-mail account. The websites were sent to him by his military friends. He did \nnot consider viewing pornographic websites from his personal e-mail a problem or in \nviolation of any policy. During his September 2014 background interview, Applicant said \nhe clicked on links provided by his father, which he did not know contained \npornographic as well as shopping websites. (Tr. 106-107; GE 11, GE 13) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant was counseled while employed with \nU.S. General Services Administration (GSA) for misuse of his Government credit card. \nIn 2012, his employment with GSA was terminated. Applicant admitted this allegation in \nresponse to the SOR. He denied that the misuse of his Government credit card was \n\n \n6 \n \n \nintentional. His wife inadvertently pulled this credit card out of a stack of personal credit \ncards Applicant kept at home. When GSA notified him of the fraudulent activity, he \nimmediately paid the balance billed to his Government credit card. He claimed to have \nself-reported the misuse of his Government credit card to his supervisor. His supervisor \ntold Applicant that this incident was a minor issue. Applicant was later called into an \noffice with his supervisor and the chief of staff, approximately six weeks before the \nexpiration of his employment probationary period. They asked him to commit contract \nfraud, which he immediately refused. The chief of staff slipped a piece of paper to him, \nand he discovered that he was being placed on a PIP for insubordination, and misuse of \na Government credit card. Applicant stated he turned over the PIP document and wrote \nthat he immediately resigned his position with GSA. Before he walked out of the room, \nhe was told that he could not resign from a government job. It was his understanding \nthat he resigned from GSA. Upon further question at the hearing, Applicant was asked \nwhy he had denied being fired from GSA, as he indicated that he thought he was simply \nlet go during his probationary period. Applicant said this statement was correct, as he \nwas unsure of his status when he left employment with GSA. (Tr. 76-77, 83-93, 146; AE \nE) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.h alleges that Applicant falsified his 2014 SCA when he listed \nthat he left employment with GSA to start his own business. SOR \u00b6 1.i alleges Applicant \nfalsified information on the same SCA when he denied he was fired, quit after being told \nhe would be fired, or left employment by mutual agreement for misconduct or \nunsatisfactory performance. (GE 2) Applicant denied these allegations. He did start his \ncompany after leaving GSA, and he had resigned from his position. (Tr. 93-95, 103-104, \n127-128) \n \nDuring the hearing, his attorney asked Applicant:  \n \nCounsel: \u201cAnd it was your understanding that you resigned and they \n(GSA) said no, you can\u2019t resign.\u201d \n \nApplicant: \u201cThat is correct.\u201d \n \nCounsel: \u201cAnd they fired you.\u201d \n \nApplicant: \u201cThat is correct.\u201d \n \nCounsel: \u201cBut you weren\u2019t aware of that?\u201d \n \nApplicant: \u201cNo I wasn\u2019t. Once again I didn\u2019t hire legal counsel. Once \nagain [I] walked out of the building the same day.\u201d (Tr. 93) \n \n\u2026and later during the hearing:  \n \nCounsel: \u201cAnd it says when in fact you were terminated from that \n(GSA) position. Did you understand you were terminated?\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant: \u201cNo, not at that time I did not know I was terminated.\u201d (Tr. \n103) \n \nOn the 2017 SCA completed by Applicant, he listed his reason for leaving \nGSA as follows: \n \nI was terminated for insubordination. I was asked by my entire team \nof executives to illegally award several contracts, valued in the $100s \nof millions of dollars, to companies of their choosing. I told them that \nit was illegal, and that I respectfully refused. When I did that, I was \nstill under my \u20181 year probationary\u2019 period, and was terminated from \nmy employment.\u201d (GE 1 pg. 14) [ \n \nOn page 15 of his 2017 SCA, Applicant said, \u201c\u2026When I refused, respectfully, I was \nissued termination papers, and left the same day. If I had to do it again, I would do \nit EXACTLY the same way. No questions.\u201d \n \nDuring the hearing Applicant was questioned about his contradictory statements. \nHe stated that he learned much later that he had been terminated by GSA in 2012. \nWhen he filled out the SCA in 2014, he reflected that termination information he just \nonly recently discovered. When asked how he found out about his termination from \nGSA, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t remember. There\u2019s somehow I did find out. I don\u2019t remember. I \ndon\u2019t recall.\u201d (Tr. 147-149) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant was arrested in May 2012 for assault \nof a family member (wife). Applicant testified that during this time he was having \ndifficulty with his wife. He claimed she was addicted to illegal drugs. He admitted during \nthe hearing to being arrested in state A for having an open container in public, but he \ndenied ever being arrested in May 2012 or convicted of domestic assault. (Tr. 49-52) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview in January 2013, he told the investigator that \nhis neighbors called the police whenever he and his wife got into a loud argument. The \npolice were called three times to their apartment, and his wife was arrested on all three \noccasions. Applicant stated he was never arrested or charged with domestic \ndisturbance on any of those occasions. (GE 12) State A criminal record and an FBI \nidentification record both show that Applicant was arrested in May 2012 for assault of a \nfamily member. Two months later, in July 2012, the charge was nolle prossed. (GE 9-\n10) Applicant did not disclose his May 2012 arrest for assault of a family member on his \n2014 or 2017 SCA. (GE 1-2) It is important to note that during his interview in \nSeptember 2014, Applicant provided a different account of the incident. He stated the \npolice were called to their apartment in May 2012 due a loud argument, and the policy \nof State A police is that one of the individuals involved in the domestic disturbance must \nbe arrested if the police are called to investigate. In May 2012, Applicant volunteered \n(emphasis added) to go with the police because his wife already had several criminal \nconvictions. He spent about eight hours in jail, he met with a magistrate, paid a fine, and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwas then released. Applicant did not list the arrest on the SCA as he was unaware that \nhe had been charged with any criminal offense. (GE 11)  \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant was arrested in December 2015 for \nassault of a family member (wife). As indicated previously, Applicant claimed the \nneighbors called the police on multiple occasions whenever he and his wife got into a \nloud argument. On this particular night, he and his wife were having a loud verbal \nargument. He left the residence and stayed overnight in a hotel. The next morning, \nApplicant was arrested by the police for assault after leaving his hotel room. Since it \nwas a holiday weekend, he was held in jail for three days before he could see a judge. \n(Tr. 52-54; GE 9; AE G) \n \nWhile sitting in jail, Applicant realized he had a company payroll cycle that \nneeded attention, but he did not have his business partner\u2019s telephone number \nmemorized. The only phone number he had memorized was his wife\u2019s phone number. \nApplicant claimed he did not realize that a protective order had been issued, so he \ncalled his wife from jail. They had a cordial conversation, and he asked her to call his \nbusiness partner to handle the company payroll. Applicant was then rearrested for \nviolation of a protection order. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) The protective order remained valid for a \nperiod of five months. Applicant had to move into his own apartment. Applicant \naccepted a deferred sentence agreement which required him to successfully complete \n24 weeks of an anger management program, and successfully complete two years of \nprobation without further violations. The violation of a protective order was nolle prossed \nin March 2016. Applicant successfully completed the anger management program in \nSeptember 2016, and the assault of a family member charge was dismissed in March \n2018. (Tr. 54-58; GE 9; AE G) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n\n \n9 \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable under the established facts \nin this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n10 \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official,\u2026 in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, and  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to: \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified SCAs and background interviews concerning his \nemployment and termination history with the Peace Corps and GSA. He intentionally \nfailed to fully disclose the circumstances of his workplace misconduct, and he provided \ncontradictory and inconsistent statements throughout multiple security clearance \ninvestigations. While serving as a government contracting officer in Iraq, Applicant was \naccused of setting up a sham company, bribery, and receiving monetary kickbacks for \nawarding contacts to companies involved in the scheme. He was arrested on more than \none occasion for assault on a family member, and he was arrested for violation of a \nprotection order. As recently as 2018, the court dismissed an assault charge against \nApplicant after his completion of anger management classes and two years of \nprobation. Applicant did not disclose his full criminal history on the SCAs, and he \nprovided contradictory statements about his May 2012 assault arrest during two \nbackground interviews. Applicant admitted to intentionally accessing pornography on a \ngovernment computer, but his previous accounts of how he accessed these websites, \nand whether he did so intentionally, were also inconsistent. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible. He has not made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct omissions or \nfalsifications provided during the course of several security clearance investigations. His \nclaim that either a judge\u2019s ruling, or a company settlement agreement, preventing him \nfrom disclosing his workplace misconduct pursuant to a \u201cgag order\u201d is self-serving and \nunconvincing. He demonstrates a pattern of dishonesty, which casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. Many of his statements and \nexplanations were uncorroborated. After reviewing his history of misconduct and deceit, \nI find that it is probable Applicant\u2019s inappropriate behavior is likely to recur. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n12 \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. This SOR highlights serious offenses that \nprovides insight to Applicant\u2019s character and integrity. Applicant is not remorseful for his \nmisconduct or deceit. His explanations are self-serving and insincere. I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated security concerns raised by his personal conduct. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n      Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 6, 2015. \nOn October 13, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons \n(SOR), \nalleging \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The DOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on November 30, 2017, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nFebruary 21, 2018, and the case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 22, \n2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \n04/10/2019\n\n2 \n \nhearing was scheduled for June 7, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which \nwas admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 12, 2018. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant appeared at the hearing with a personal representative. However, both \nApplicant and the personal representative were unfamiliar with the hearing process. It \nwas Applicant\u2019s intention for the personal representative to testify on Applicant\u2019s behalf. \nWe resolved this issue as follows: Both parties waived opening statements and the \npersonal representative testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf, and then acted as Applicant\u2019s \npersonal representative. \n \n \nAt the start of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR \nallegations, and further stated that he might make an additional motion at the end of the \nhearing. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion and Applicant was initially uncertain as \nto whether or not he was prepared to proceed with the hearing. I stated that I would leave \nthe record open for 30 days in order to permit Applicant to more fully respond to the \namended allegations and to submit additional documentation. Under these conditions, \nApplicant determined that he was prepared to proceed with the hearing. Department \nCounsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence, and I granted his motion \nwithout objection. The record remained open until July 9, 2018. Applicant timely submitted \nAX B through H, which included a statement addressing the SOR amendments. I admitted \nthe additional evidence without objection. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, 56, is a senior software systems engineer currently employed by a \ndefense contractor since April 2008. He was previously employed in the same position by \ndefense contractors since at least 2002. Applicant worked as a Federal employee from \n1988 until 1997. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1985. He and \nhis wife married in 1982 and have three adult children. He was granted his first security \nclearance in 1988. (GX 1.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR as amended alleges that Applicant failed to timely file \nhis state and federal tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2016. Applicant admits the \nSOR allegations. The delinquent tax filings are documented in Applicant\u2019s responses to \ninterrogatories, Answer, and documentary submissions. His admissions are incorporated \nin my findings of fact. \n \nApplicant does not have any formal training in tax preparation. He prepares and \nfiles his own tax returns using tax-preparation software, due in large measure to his \nconcern that accountants and tax preparers are likely targets of hacking. For many years, \nApplicant erroneously believed that if he was entitled to a refund from the IRS, he was \nnot required to file his tax return on the annual deadline, but was instead required to file \n\n3 \n \nwithin three years of the annual deadline or he would forfeit his refund. (GX 2; Tr. 37-38; \nAnswer.) Applicant also stated that his state of residence withholds refunds after two \nyears, so he historically tried to file his Federal and state taxes within two years of the \ndeadline. (Tr. 37-38.) \n \nApplicant attributes his late tax filings primarily to the complexity of his taxes, his \nmisconception about filing requirements, and his efforts to maintain balance in his family \nand work lives. (Answer.) The issues and events that Applicant identifies as having made \nhis tax accounting and preparation complex, and his filings and payments delinquent, are \ndiscussed more fully below. \n \nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s wife was in a serious car accident in which she was gravely \ninjured. She suffered from ongoing health issues for many years that required frequent \nmedical attention. Applicant incurred significant medical costs, and itemized these on his \ntax returns. (GX 2; Tr. 50.) Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s health deteriorated in 2012 and 2013, and \nshe underwent surgery in 2014 as a result of the injuries she received in the accident. \nThrough the years, Applicant prioritized his wife\u2019s medical care and concern over her \nhealth over preparing his tax returns. (Answer.) \n \nIn approximately 2008, Applicant started a two-pronged business venture. He \npurchased a used recreational vehicle (RV) with the intention of refurbishing it and \nreselling it. He also bought an online subscription service that was theoretically designed \nto permit Applicant to purchase deeply discounted vacation packages to resell. A \ncomponent of the vacation-sale business was to recruit other people to purchase and sell \nthe packages, and Applicant would receive a percentage of their sales. Applicant did not \ngenerate any reportable income from either part of the business, nor did he ever obtain a \nbusiness license. (GX 2; Answer.) However, the business did generate expenses that \nApplicant itemized on his tax returns. Applicant did not keep business records in real time \nand this complicated his ability to gather information in order to timely file his tax returns. \n(Tr. 53-58.) Applicant officially closed the business in June 2016. (Answer.) \n \nIn tax year 2011, Applicant\u2019s then-employer issued stock options to its employees, \nincluding Applicant. Because of the way the employer issued the stock options, the value \nof the options was imputed to the employees as income, which necessarily increased \ntheir tax obligations. The employer sent Applicant an IRS Schedule K-1 that was incorrect. \nApplicant contacted the employer, which in turn contacted the IRS to amend the Schedule \nK-1s. It took several years for this issue to be corrected, and Applicant did not file his tax \nreturns while the issue was pending. (GX 2.) It is unclear when the schedule K-1 was \namended. Applicant sold the stocks in April 2017 and received his last Schedule K-1 in \nMarch 2017. (Tr. 63-65.) \n \nIt took Applicant approximately 440 hours to do the accounting and tax preparation \nfor tax year 2014. Despite this large investment of time, Applicant miscalculated his tax \nobligation and owed approximately $90. He filed the 2014 Federal return in July 2017, \nand paid the amount due in September 2017. (GX 2; Tr. 45-46; Answer.) \n \n\n4 \n \nApplicant spoke extensively about his delinquent tax filings during his personal \nsubject interview (PSI) in May 2015. Applicant identified tax year 2011 as the year he \nbegan having difficulty in his tax accounting and preparation in both his e-QIP and his \nPSI. He stated because of his difficulties filing his 2011 tax returns, he was unable to \ntimely file 2012, 2013, and 2014. He filed his 2011 Federal return on April 21, 2015. He \nanticipated filing his 2013 and 2014 tax returns soon. Additionally, the IRS sent inquiries \nto Applicant for non-filing of tax returns in at least 2012, 2013, and 2016. (GX 2; Answer.) \n \nApplicant signed his responses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories on October 4, 2017. The \ninterrogatories required Applicant to submit IRS account transcripts for tax years 2011 \nthrough 2016. Applicant stated that his 2016 state and Federal tax returns remained \nunfiled. However, his 2015 state and Federal returns were also unfiled. He filed his 2015 \nFederal return on October 10, 2017. Applicant filed for an extension for his 2016 Federal \nreturn. However, he missed the October 15, 2017, deadline and filed the return on \nNovember 24, 2017. (GX 2; Tr. 43-45; Answer.). \n \nThe instructions section of IRS Form 1040, updated annually, specifically sets forth \nthe filing requirements for that tax year. For example, in 2011 married couples filing jointly \nwith both spouses under the age of 65 with a gross income of at least $20,600 were \nrequired to file a Federal return by April 18, 2016.1 Applicant\u2019s income has exceeded the \nannual minimum gross income for tax years 2011 through 2016.2 (Answer.) Applicant was \ngenerally entitled to receive refunds from the IRS. However, he forfeited his 2011 refund \nby filing the return more than three years after the filing deadline on April 21, 2015. \nApplicant filed automatic extensions for several tax years, but did not meet the October \n15 deadlines. (GX 2; Tr. 40-43; Answer.)  \n \nApplicant filed an extension for his 2017 Federal tax return, which moved his \ndeadline to October 15, 2018. However, Applicant\u2019s accounting and tax preparation \nresulted in Applicant\u2019s owing Federal tax for 2017. He was required by Federal law to \nsubmit his payment by the April 2018 filing deadline. On May 31, 2018, Applicant filed the \nreturn with a check for $2,500 for tax payment. (AX A.) Further, this submission occurred \none week after Applicant acknowledged receipt of the Notice of Hearing.3 Regarding his \n2017 return, Applicant stated: \n \nIt is interesting that my 2017 \"Application for Automatic Extension of Time \nto File\" projects us receiving a $300 refund while my actual tax filing shows \nus owing additional taxes. In other words, we made yet another mistake. It \nis a humbling lesson learned for me going forward that estimates (just like \n2014) can be wrong. (AX B.) \n \n                                            \n1 The relevant pages from 2011 1040 instructions from www.irs.gov are appended to the record as Administrative \nExhibit (AD EX) IV. \n \n2 See www.irs.gov. \n \n3 The email acknowledging receipt of the Notice of Hearing is appended to the file as AD EX II. Appellant\u2019s sheet of \ncorrections of the transcript is amended to the file as AD EX III. \n\n5 \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant realized he was required to file by the IRS deadlines \nregardless of whether or not he was entitled to a refund, but it was at some point prior to \nfiling his Answer on November 30, 2017. However, Applicant also stated in his Answer \nthat his \u201cprevious security investigations revealed this same issue since [his] wife\u2019s wreck \nin 2001 and since the start of [his] business in 2008.\u201d Upon receiving the SOR, he realized \nthat his practice of delinquently filing his tax returns could have a negative impact on his \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 67-70.)  \n \nApplicant does not owe any balance for his 2014 state tax. However, as of \nSeptember 28, 2017, Applicant had not filed his 2015 and 2016 state tax returns. \n(Answer.) Applicant filed his 2017 state tax return on May 31, 2018. (AX A.) \n \nApplicant thinks filing his tax returns will be simplified now that he no longer has to \nwait for a Schedule K-1 or incorporate the information from it into his tax calculations, but \ninstead receives a standard employee W-2. (Tr. 66.) Applicant stated that because he \nwas operating under the misconception that he had three years to file if he was owed a \nrefund from the IRS, he did not think he was violating any laws. (Tr. 70.) Applicant stated \nseveral times that he remains circumspect about hiring a tax preparer or accountant out \nof concern that Applicant\u2019s personal information will be hacked. His current intention is to \ncontinue preparing his own tax returns. (Tr. 64-73.) Applicant does not have any \ndelinquent accounts or other financial issues. (AX C-AX H.) Now that Applicant is aware \nof the negative impact his delinquent filing of his Federal and state tax returns could have \non his security eligibility, he intends to timely file all future tax returns. (Tr. 70-71.) \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s witness, a security specialist who has worked with Applicant for more \nthan 11 years, holds a security clearance. She is aware of the SOR allegations. She \ntestified that Applicant is trustworthy and reliable, stating that he has identified and helped \nto rectify several data spillages that were potentially damaging, and that he has never \ncaused a security-related incident. (Tr. 28-31.) Applicant provided character references \nfrom his supervisor since 2003, a friend of over 30 years, a coworker since 2008, and a \nformer coworker and friend of 28 years. Each is aware of the SOR allegations. \nCollectively, they stated that Applicant is a person of integrity who is skilled in his \nprofession. Given Applicant\u2019s character and trustworthiness, they highly recommend \nApplicant for continued access to classified information. (Answer.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \n\n6 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying condition: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant did not timely file his Federal and state tax returns for 2011 through 2016, \ndespite receiving extensions for many years. He did not timely pay his 2014 and 2017 tax \nobligations. The 2011 inaccurate tax reporting by Applicant\u2019s employer and Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s medical expenses were conditions that were beyond Applicant\u2019s control. These \n\n8 \n \nconditions added complexity to Applicant\u2019s accounting and tax preparation, which \ncontributed to his inability to timely file his tax returns. It is understandable that Applicant \nwanted to maintain balance with his personal and professional lives and to prioritize his \nwife\u2019s care. Further, it is not unreasonable for Applicant to be concerned that his personal \ninformation could be at risk through hacking. Nevertheless, Applicant did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. There are a myriad of options that Applicant could \nhave employed to protect his personal information when using the services of a tax \nprofessional. For example, Applicant could ensure that the tax professional computed \nApplicant\u2019s taxes without entering his personal information. The computed tax information \ncould then be entered by Applicant and submitted to the taxing authority. \n \n \nApplicant also attributes his pattern of failing to timely file his tax returns to his \nmisconception about his filing requirements. Applicant is college educated and has \nworked as a software systems engineer since at least 2002. The 1040 instructions clearly \nset forth the filing requirements and these requirements have applied to Applicant for all \ntax years in question. It is unclear exactly when Applicant fully understood that he is \nrequired to file his Federal tax return annually by the IRS deadlines established by the \nIRS. \n  \n \nFurther, Applicant has been given notice that the government is concerned about \ntimely filing of taxes by the questions asked on his 2015 e-QIP, and likely during his \nprevious background investigations. Applicant was also questioned extensively about his \nfailure to timely file his taxes during his May 2015 PSI. Applicant had to have understood \nthe security concern raised by his pattern of delinquently filing his tax returns when he \nreceived DOHA\u2019s interrogatories in September 2017. The fact that Applicant filed his 2015 \ntax return the day after he completed his responses to interrogatories underscores the \nfact that Applicant understood that his failure to timely file his tax returns had security \nclearance implications.  \n \n \nHowever, despite having received the SOR in October 2017, Applicant did not file \nhis 2016 Federal tax return until November 24, 2017, well after the extension deadline. \nHe did not timely pay his 2018 Federal tax obligation. Applicant filed his 2017 return, the \nfirst return filed within an extension period, and paid his tax obligation only after receiving \nthe hearing notice. Applicant asserted that he will timely file his future tax returns now that \nhe is aware of the security clearance implications. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s overarching motivation for his last-minute efforts to comply with his tax-\nfiling obligations, as well as his future promise of compliance, is protecting his security \nclearance. The appeal board has regularly held that \u201capplicants who only begin to address \ntheir security-significant conduct when their personal interests are at stake may be lacking \nin judgment and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, \n2017.)  \n \n \nIn specifically addressing mitigating condition 20(g) in ISCR Case No. 17-01807 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018), the appeal board observed: \n \n\n9 \n \nThe mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a payment \nagreement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to \nissue a favorable decision. As with the application of any mitigating \ncondition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide whether \nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. \nThe timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the judge to \nconsider in the application of [this mitigating condition]. pp 3-4. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of failing to timely file his Federal and state tax returns is recent \nand raises concerns about his willingness to abide by rules and regulations, and his \ncurrent reliability and judgment. While many factors contributed to Applicant\u2019s failure to \ntimely file his Federal and state tax returns for many years, he did not act reasonably \nunder those circumstances. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2 were addressed under that guideline, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1988. His supervisor, coworkers, and \nfriends highly recommend Applicant for a continued security clearance. He is a skilled \nprofessional. However, through his failure to timely file and pay his taxes, Applicant has \nnot demonstrated the judgment and reliability required of individuals granted access to \nclassified information. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his failure to timely file his tax returns taxes \nas required. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him continued eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

Sykstus, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his 2012 arrest for felony \naggravated child abuse. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on May 21, 2013. On \nDecember 23, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline J. The DOD acted under Executive \nOrder (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.  \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 22, 2017, and the case \nwas assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 21, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for June 6, 2018. \n03/14/2019\n\n2 \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AX) A through Q, which were admitted without objection, and called four witnesses. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2018. \n \nThe SOR was issued under the AG implemented on September 1, 2006. The DOD \nimplemented the amended AG on June 8, 2017, while this decision was pending. This \ndecision will be decided based on the amended AG effective June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old engineering manager currently employed by a defense \ncontractor since October 2015, and employed in the defense industry since 1993. He has \nheld a clearance since 1996. He earned a bachelor of science degree in mathematics in \n1993. He and his current wife married in 2004. They have a blended family with three \nchildren ages 19, 18, and 11. (GX 1.)  \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline J that Applicant was arrested in October 2012 \nand charged with felony aggravated child abuse. The arrest was based on accusations \nmade by Applicant\u2019s oldest son and Applicant\u2019s ex-wife. Applicant admits that he was \narrested, but denies that he committed any criminal act. \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife married in 1996 and divorced in November 2004. At the \ntime of the divorce, Applicant and his ex-wife had a 5-year-old son. Following the divorce, \nApplicant and his ex-wife have repeatedly returned to court over issues of custody and \nchild support. Their relationship is contentious, at best. (AX A - AX E.) \n \nIn October 2012, Applicant and his ex-wife had joint custody of their 12-year-old \nson. At the request of his ex-wife, Applicant went to her house to discipline their son. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife met Applicant in the driveway and showed him marks on her wrists \nwhere their son had grabbed her while she was trying to punish him for failing math. \nApplicant entered the house and confronted his son. Applicant, in the presence of his ex-\nwife, removed his belt and hit his son three times with it for being disrespectful to his \nmother. Applicant further told his son that he would not be permitted to participate in any \nextracurricular activities until his math grade improved. (Tr. 28-31.) \n \nThe following week, Applicant had custody of his son. Applicant learned from a \nfriend of his daughter\u2019s that Applicant\u2019s son had posted, \u201cI hate my f-ing dad\u2019s guts\u201d on a \nsocial media account. Applicant was distressed by the post, but was also distressed \nbecause he did not allow his children to have social media accounts. (Tr. 32-33.) \n \nApplicant logged in to the site and pulled up his son\u2019s post. Applicant showed the \npost to his son and demanded that his son read the post aloud. His son was clearly afraid, \nand refused to read the post. Applicant \u201cpopped\u201d his son in the back of the head and \nagain demanded that his son read the post aloud. His son refused. Applicant grabbed his \nson by the front of the shirt and catching his son\u2019s leather necklace, a scuffle ensued, and \n\n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s son ended up on the kitchen floor, screaming and crying. Applicant told his \nson to calm down and go to bed. (Tr. 32-36.) \n \nThe next morning, Applicant\u2019s son wore a shirt buttoned to the neck to school. In \nthe early afternoon, Applicant got a telephone call informing him that he needed to go to \nthe county\u2019s child advocacy center for some issues with his son. When Applicant arrived, \nhis ex-wife\u2019s car was already there. Applicant was met by county officers who wanted to \ndiscuss aggravated child abuse charges with Applicant. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife had told the \nofficers about the incident the night before, as well as the spanking incident the previous \nweek, which combined, rose to the level of felony aggravated child abuse. (Tr. 36-40.) \n \nApplicant was shown photographs of his son\u2019s neck which had multiple red marks \non it. Applicant did not see any marks on his son\u2019s neck following the scuffle or the next \nmorning because of his son\u2019s fully buttoned shirt, but believes they were possibly caused \nin part by the leather necklace, but were primarily self-inflicted by his son. (Tr. 90-91; GX \n2; Tr. 61-63.) \n \nApplicant was indicted by a grand jury, arrested, and charged with felony \naggravated child abuse. (GX 4.) He properly reported the arrest to his facility security \nofficer who instructed Applicant to keep the security office informed. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife \nimmediately filed for child support and sole custody of their son. Following the indictment, \nthe contract on which Applicant was working went to another contractor and Applicant \nwas laid off. Despite submitting hundreds of job applications, Applicant was unemployed \nfor approximately 11 months. (Tr. 38-41.)   \n \nAfter approximately two years, in September 2014, on the advice of his attorney, \nApplicant pled guilty to third-degree assault, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to one \nyear in prison, which was suspended for two years; two years\u2019 supervised probation; a \n$500 fine; $250 restitution; and 40 hours community service. Applicant was also required \nto complete: a domestic violence program; a parenting program; an anger management \nprogram; and undergo an assessment for drug or alcohol abuse. A protective order in \nApplicant\u2019s son\u2019s favor was entered against Applicant which required him to have no \ncontact with his son. (GX 4.) Applicant completed restitution in March 2016, all other court \nrequirements between 2013 and 2015, and was released from probation without violation \nin October 2015. (AX F - AX J.) Applicant has not had any contact with his son since \n2012. (Tr. 40-41.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, who was present during the incident with Applicant\u2019s son, \nrecounted the events in accord with Applicant. The following day, she met Applicant at \nthe child advocacy center, and was interviewed and gave a written statement to the police \nwherein she emphatically stated that Applicant had not abused his son. Applicant\u2019s wife \nwas shown pictures of the marks on Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s neck, and was shocked. She \ntestified that there were no markings or injuries on Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s neck when he went \nto bed after the incident. (Tr. 77-85.) She further testified to the strength of character of \nApplicant, and stated that Applicant is a devoted father to all of their children and would \nnever abuse any of them. (Tr. 75-76.)  \n\n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother testified that Applicant has never been an overly strict \ndisciplinarian, and has been a very involved father for all of his children. (Tr. 100-102.) \nApplicant\u2019s friend, who is also a pastor, stated that Applicant discussed the situation with \nhis son with him, and that Applicant was deeply affected by the situation. (Tr. 107.) \nApplicant\u2019s friend of over 13 years, who is a public school nurse and was previously an \nemergency room nurse, has witnessed victims of child abuse. She has observed \nApplicant and his wife around all of their children and has never witnessed any type or \npattern of abuse in their household. (Tr. 112 \u2013 113.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was credible and remorseful. The summary of Applicant\u2019s \npersonal subject interview (PSI) and his Answer are consistent with his testimony and his \nwife\u2019s testimony. Applicant has never been accused of any other abuse. Applicant wrote \na letter to his son at the time of the incident stating \u201cI\u2019m here for you.\u201d He has maintained \nthe same cell phone numbers and hopes and prays that someday his son will contact \nhim. (Tr. 66.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \n\n5 \n \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe concern under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe following disqualifying condition applies under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or \nconvicted. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n\n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant was indicted for felony aggravated child abuse. He later pled guilty to \nthird-degree assault, a misdemeanor. He has not had any contact with his son since 2012. \nHe completed all court-ordered requirements and was released from probation without \nviolation in 2015. Applicant admits that he spanked him on one occasion and that he \nsmacked the back of his son\u2019s head and grabbed him up out of the chair by the front of \nhis shirt on another occasion. There is no history of reported abuse prior to these two \nincidents that occurred in 2012, nor are there any more recent allegations of any type of \nabuse of Applicant\u2019s other two children. These two incidents with Applicant\u2019s son occurred \nmore than six years ago under circumstances that are not likely to recur. The incidents \ndo not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nSince 2012, Applicant paid restitution, successfully completed all requirements of \nprobation, has regained employment with a defense contractor, and continues to be a \nyouth-sports coach in his community. He regrets the loss of his relationship with his son \nand hopes he will contact him in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1996. He properly reported his arrest \nto his employer. Applicant is remorseful for his past conduct. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline J, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his arrest. Accordingly, I conclude he has \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Katauskas, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 20 August 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.2\nApplicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a decision without hearing by the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The record in this case closed 25\nMarch 2017, when Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due. Applicant provided no\nadditional documents. DOHA assigned the case to me 1 October 2017.\nConsisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-8 .\n1\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. On 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed Security\nExecutive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8 June 2017. \n1\n   12/11/2018\n\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old configuration manager employed by a U.S. defense\ncontractor since October 2013. She has served previously in similar positions with a\nseries of defense contractors since May 1992. She has had small gaps in employment\nas her currently employer lost its bid on the renewal contract, only to have herself be\nhired by the successor contractor. The longest such gap was from December 2005 to\nJune 2006. She seeks to retain the clearance she was issued in July 2007 (Item 5, 6).\nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (Items 6-8) establish,12 delinquent\ndebts totaling nearly $12,000, and a May 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition which was\ndischarged in June 2005. Applicant admitted some debts, and the bankruptcy; claimed\nthat some debts had been included in her bankruptcy; and claimed to have been\nunaware of some other debts. She listed no delinquent debts on her December 2014\nclearance application (Item 5), but was confronted with them during an April 2015\ninterview with a Government investigator (Item 6) based on a January 2015 credit report\n(Item 7). She similarly failed to disclose a handful of criminal arrests/citations (SOR 2.a-\n2.f), but was confronted with them during her interview.3\nApplicant documented no efforts to address her debts, either after her interview or\nafter she received the SOR. She attributed her 2005 bankruptcy filing to her August 1997\ndivorce, but it is difficult to see this as anything but attenuated. She provided no budget\nor financial statement. She has not documented any financial or credit counseling. She\nprovided no work or character references, or any evidence of community involvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the\nrelevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant claimed that she thought the felony question (SOR 2.f) referred to the last seven years, and in any\n3\nevent, she had discussed the offense during her 2007 background investigation. She provided no\ncorroboration for this latter claim, but given the age of the offense (nearly 25 years at the time of her clearance\napplication) I find the allegation to hold little security significance. Regarding her omissions of her more-recent\ncriminal history and financial problems, she variously claimed to have forgotten them or to have listed them\non her clearance application. These explanations are less credible.\n2\n\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of\nfinancial difficulties for which she did not provide any documentation of efforts to resolve\nher debts.5\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. \nShe has not clearly documented any efforts to resolve them.  Applicant did not document\n6\nthat her financial problems were due to circumstances beyond her control, and she\ndocumented no efforts to resolve them, either after her subject interview or after she\nreceived the SOR or FORM.  Applicant has had no credit or financial counseling, and\n7\nthere is no evidence any of the debts are being resolved.  Her lack of effort does not\n8\nconstitute a good-faith effort to address her debts.  In addition, Applicant has not\n9\ndemonstrated a track record of living within her means. Furthermore, Applicant provided\nno \u201cwhole-person\u201d evidence to mitigate the security concerns raised by her inaction on\nthe debts. Accordingly, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n19(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history\n5\nof not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n8\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n9\n3\n\n \nIn similar fashion, the Government established cases for disqualification under\nGuidelines J and E. At a minimum, the circumstances of her criminal conduct and her\nclearance application omissions bespeak an inattentiveness to detail which is\ninconsistent with access to classified information. Her response to the SOR is largely a\nplea to save her job, but without a more thorough explanation of her criminal conduct\nand the clearance application omissions, she cannot mitigate the security concerns\nraised by these allegations. Accordingly, I conclude Guidelines J and E against\nApplicant.\n Formal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-m:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

(Tr. 21-22, 53) In 2012, Applicant and his spouse were \nnaturalized as U.S. citizens. (Tr. 52) He has property in the United States including a \nhome and about $22,000 in his U.S. bank account. (Tr. 24; AE F) \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has three relatives living in Iraq. His father and \none sister are citizens and residents of Kurdistan, a region of Iraq.

(Tr. 38) His mother is deceased. (Tr. 40) \nHis most recent visit with his father was in 2012, and he most recently communicated \nwith his father or sister two or three years ago. (Tr. 27-28) He does not send money to \nhis father or sister in Iraq. (Tr. 28) He does not own property or bank accounts in Iraq. \n(Tr. 28-29) When his father dies, he does not plan to go to Iraq for his father\u2019s funeral, \nand his father\u2019s property in Iraq will go to his sister in Iraq. (Tr. 39-41) His only visits to \nIraq after 2012 were on behalf of his employer. (Tr. 41) \n \nApplicant has a sister who lived in Iraq and is a citizen of Iraq. She currently \nresides in Germany with her husband. (Tr. 29; SOR \u00b6 1.c) He communicates with his \nsister in Germany, who provides information to Applicant about his family in Iraq.

ISCR Case No. 08-06795 at 6 n. 3 (App. Bd. May 25, 2012). \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \nForeign Preference \n \nApplicant is not fluent in English. He admitted twice that he voted in an Iraqi \nelection in 2014. (Tr. 30; SOR response; Officer of Personnel Management (OPM) \npersonal subject interview (PSI); GE 2) In his OPM PSI, which is the investigator\u2019s \nsummary of his statement, he said he voted because he wanted to help Iraq become a \nbetter democratic country like the United States. (Tr. 44; GE 2) He may have simply \nagreed with the OPM investigator\u2019s statements about voting. Applicant explained in \nbroken English, \u201cIt\u2019s not a vote. There was misunderstood for me in that question, \nbecause they, did you practice or did you exercise this election. I said yes. Yeah I work \non it. I\u2019m not vote in it.\u201d (Tr. 31) He said he did not understand English \u201cvery good,\u201d and \u201cI \nwork there. It\u2019s not vote.\u201d (Tr. 44) \u201cI see a lot of Iraqis they come to vote. That one they \nvote in Iraq and they vote. For that I say it\u2019s allowed to Iraqis to vote who\u2019s living in the \nU.S. . . . So for that I say they allowed to me. But I\u2019m not voted on.\u201d (Tr. 45-46) He was \nunable to clarify the content of the summary in his OPM PSI, possibly because he could \nnot understand the questions about it; however, he insisted that he did not vote in the \nIraqi election. (Tr. 49) \n \nIn 2010 and 2014, Applicant worked as a volunteer while living in the United \nStates to help expatriate Iraqis living in the United States vote in Iraqi elections. (Tr. 31-\n32, 47) He was paid in 2014; however, he was unsure if he was paid in 2010 for this \nwork. (Tr. 31-32; 42-43) He did not say whether or not the Iraqi or U.S. government or \nsome other entity paid him in 2014. \n \nApplicant did not believe he continued to have Iraqi citizenship, and in any event, \nhe was willing to renounce his Iraqi citizenship. (Tr. 50)4 In 2012, he took the \nNaturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America (AE H) which states: \n \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and \nabjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will \nbear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf \nof the United States when required by the law; that I will perform \nnoncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when \nrequired by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under \ncivilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation \nfreely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me \nGod.5 \n                                            \n4 The Iraqi Council of the Presidency issued Article 10(I), which states, \u201cAn Iraqi who acquires a \nforeign nationality shall retain his Iraqi nationality, unless he has declared in writing renunciation of his \nIraqi nationality.\u201d Iraqi Official Gazette Issue 4019 dated March 7, 2006, No. 26, https://www.refworld.org/ \npdfid/4b1e364c2.pdf.  \n \n5 The language of the current Oath of Allegiance is found in the Code of Federal Regulations \nSection 337.1 and is closely based upon the statutory elements in Section 337(a) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1448, https://www.uscis.gov/us-\ncitizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-oath-allegiance-united-states-america. \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant serves as a linguist for the U.S. Army in Iraq. (Tr. 25) He goes on \npatrols outside his base with soldiers, and he wears a helmet and vest outside his base. \n(Tr. 25; AE I) He is not permitted to carry a weapon. (Tr. 26) He does not visit his family \nin Iraq. (Tr. 26) He is not authorized to leave the Army base or to have visitors at the \nArmy base. (Tr. 26) He provided photographs of Army personnel he served with in Iraq. \n(Tr. 32-36; AE I) He was present in camp when an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL) \nvehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED) exploded and caused damage to his \ncamp. (Tr. 36-37; AE I) ISIL or some other terrorists fired at his patrol three times when \nhe was in Iraq; however, he was not injured. (Tr. 51) \n \nOn April 19, 2018, an Army colonel and Task Force commander, who served \nwith Applicant in Iraq from August 2017 to April 2018, wrote: \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] dedication, professionalism and positive demeanor positively \nimpacted the Task Force\u2019s ability to communicate, coordinate and execute \noperations in close partnership with Iraqi senior leaders. [Applicant] could \nalways be counted upon to assist with requirements, going above and \nbeyond to accomplish the mission. His superb knowledge of the language \nand culture directly impacted the unit\u2019s ability to achieve mission success \nand he was an indispensable member of the team. \n \n(AE B). A major who served with Applicant in 2017 lauded Applicant for his \nprofessionalism, diligence, and contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE B) In 2016, \nan Infantry lieutenant colonel commanding a battalion observed that Appellant \nenthusiastically volunteered to move with the unit into a more dangerous and \ninhospitable area of the conflict. (AE B) He too lauded Appellant\u2019s professionalism and \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. (AE B)   \n \n \nApplicant provided five certificates of appreciation from units in Iraq praising him \nfor his contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE C) They described his diligent, \nprofessional, and honorable service as a linguist. (AE C) \n \nIraq \n \nThe U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership with \nIraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq marked \na milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, stable, and \nself-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the United States in the region as well \nas a voice of moderation and democracy in the Middle East. Iraq has functioning \ngovernment institutions including an active legislature, is playing an increasingly \nconstructive role in the region, and has a bright economic future as oil revenues surpass \npre-Saddam production levels with continued rapid growth to come. The United States \nmaintains vigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, \nand security issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement. \n \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nThe Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) between Iraq and the United States \nprovides the basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship. It covers the range of bilateral \nissues including political relations and diplomacy, defense and security, trade and \nfinance, energy, judicial and law enforcement issues, services, science, culture, \neducation, and environment. Efforts to implement the SFA are overseen by the Higher \nCoordinating Committee and several Joint Coordination Committees, which meet \nperiodically. \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping, and advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq. The current \ntravel advisory level is Level 4: Do not travel.  \n \nThe ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens \noutside Baghdad is limited given the security environment. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and \nattacks by IEDs occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Methods of \nattack have included explosively formed penetrators (EFPs), magnetic IEDs placed on \nvehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed on or concealed near roads, \nmortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire weapons. Such attacks may \ntake place in public venues such as cafes and markets.  \n \nIraq witnessed continued terrorist activity in 2016, primarily as a result of the \nactions of ISIL. In 2016, ISIL remained the greatest terrorist threat globally, maintaining a \nformidable force in Syria, including a large number of foreign terrorist fighters. ISIL\u2019s \ncapacity and territorial control in Iraq has dramatically eroded in the past two years. \nAccording to estimates from the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq, acts of terrorism and \nviolence killed more than 7,000 civilians and injured more than 12,000 in 2016. By the \nend of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory from ISIL, drastically \nreducing ISIL\u2019s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. Human rights violations continue \nto be a problem with allegations of unlawful killings and other abuses being made \nagainst the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces.  \n \nIn its annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported that \nsevere human rights problems were widespread. Sectarian hostility, widespread \ncorruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society weakened \nthe government's authority and worsened effective human rights protections. Iraqi \nSecurity Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed some \nhuman rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization Forces \nkilling, torturing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. ISIL committed the overwhelming \nmajority of serious human rights abuses, including attacks against: civilians, (particularly \nShia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL); members of other religious and ethnic \nminorities; women; and children. \n \nObservers also reported other significant human rights-related problems: harsh \nand life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; arbitrary arrest and \nlengthy pretrial detention, denial of fair public trial; insufficient judicial institutional \ncapacity; ineffective implementation of civil judicial procedures and remedies; arbitrary \ninterference with privacy and homes; child soldiers; limits on freedom of expression, \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nincluding press freedoms; violence against and harassment of journalists; undue \ncensorship; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \nlimits on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom due \nto violence by extremist groups; restrictions on freedom of movement; refugee and \ninternally displaced persons (IDP) abuse; both forced IDP returns and preventing IDPs \nfrom returning home; discrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, \nreligious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; trafficking \nin persons; societal discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due process; and \nlimitations on worker rights. \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Iraq is balanced against the \ninherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents and the Iraqi \ngovernment\u2019s problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top national \nsecurity goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and \nsupport of the Iraqi Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant admitted that his father and sister are citizens and residents of \nKurdistan, a region of Iraq. One of his sisters is a citizen of Iraq residing in Germany.   \n \nApplicant does not have frequent or recent direct contact with his family living in \nIraq. Applicant, his spouse, and three children were born in Kurdistan, a region of Iraq. \nApplicant maintains his relationships with his father and sister in Iraq through his sister \nliving in Germany. He did not establish an absence of care and concern for relatives \nliving in Iraq.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Iraq primarily \nbecause of terrorists and insurgents. Applicant has voluntarily shared in those dangers \non behalf of the DOD, and he is willing to do so in the future. Numerous linguists, \nsupporting U.S. forces, have family living in Iraq. Hundreds of United States and \ncoalition armed forces and civilian contractors serving in Iraq are targets of terrorists, \nalong with Iraqi civilians and soldiers who support the Iraqi government and cooperate \nwith coalition forces.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Iraq is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or her \nspouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another significant consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Iraq with the United States, and the situation in that country places a \nsignificant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship with \nany family member living in or visiting that country does not pose a trustworthiness or \nsecurity risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in or \nvisiting Iraq.6  \n \nGuideline B security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMay 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd.

Rather, the issue is whether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an \napplicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance [or public trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Iraq seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Iraq has a significant problem with \nterrorism. Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes \nto the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would \nattempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, \n2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Iraq or visiting that \ncountry create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on \nhis family in Iraq in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. \nThese relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced substantial \nevidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with family in Iraq and has raised the issue of \npotential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply, \nand further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) and 8(c) apply. Applicant has \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has resided in the United States since 2006, except \nwhen he was in Iraq.7 Applicant, his spouse, and his three children are citizens and \nresidents of the United States. He and his spouse swore an oath of allegiance to the \nUnited States as part of the citizenship process. He has property in the United States \nincluding a home and a substantial bank account. Most importantly, he served as a \nlinguist in Iraq supporting U.S. goals in that country.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Iraq as a linguist and cultural advisor, including \nthe dangers that service entailed, weigh towards mitigating security concerns. Applicant \nseeks a security clearance to enable him to continue serving in Iraq, providing critical \nassistance to U.S. Armed Forces in a dangerous combat environment. He has offered \nto continue to risk his life to support the United States\u2019 goals in Iraq. He has shown his \n                                            \n7 ISCR Case No. 17-00629 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018) the Appeal Board discussed a translator\u2019s \nmultiple tours on behalf of the United States in Iraq, limited time as a resident in the United States, and \nconnections to family living in Iraq. The Appeal Board stated: \n     \nIn general, an applicant\u2019s deployment to a combat zone in support of U.S. forces is not a \nfactor that weighs against his or her national security eligibility. On the contrary, such \ndeployments tend to establish various mitigating conditions such as [Directive] \u00b6 8(b) \n(\u201cthere is no conflict of interest . . . because . . . the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d); [Directive] \u00b6 8(d) (\u201cthe foreign . . . \nactivities are on U.S. Government business\u201d); and [Directive] \u00b6 8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine \nnature of the foreign business . . . is such that [it is] unlikely to result in a conflict of \ninterest and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.\u201d) \n \nId. at 3 (internal footnotes omitted) (remanding administrative judge\u2019s denial of security clearance). \n\n \n13                                                                                                                                           \npatriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his support to DOD while \nserving in Iraq.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of \ndangerous high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant \ncontribution to national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n5, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Iraq are limited as the only family members living in \nKurdistan, a region of Iraq are his sister and father. He does not have direct contact with \nhis family in Iraq. His travel to Iraq after 2012 was on behalf of the U.S. Government \nand not for personal reasons. He does not have property in Iraq. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Iraq. His father and sister reside in Kurdistan, a region of Iraq. Like \nevery other resident of Iraq, they are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights \nviolations of the Iraqi government. \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in Iraq, and Applicant has supported U.S. goals and objectives in \nIraq. Applicant and his family living in Iraq are potential targets of terrorists, and \nApplicant\u2019s potential access to classified information could theoretically add risk to his \nrelatives living in that country from lawless elements in Iraq.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Iraq continue but are \nattenuated as they are through his sister living in Germany. His connections to the \nUnited States taken together, including his support of U.S. goals in a combat \nenvironment, are sufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns under \nGuideline B.  \n \nForeign Preference \n \nAG \u00b6 9 articulates the security concern for foreign preference: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \n\n \n14                                                                                                                                           \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 lists six foreign preference conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case including: \n \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \n \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued by \nany country other than the United States; \n \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military organization; \nand \n \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in any way that conflicts with U.S. national \nsecurity interests; \n \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country in violation of U.S. law; and \n \n(f) an act of expatriation from the United States such as declaration of \nintent to renounce U.S. citizenship, whether through words or actions.  \n \n \nIn July 2012, Applicant was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. He erroneously stated \nthat he voted in an Iraqi election in 2014.8 Applicant credibly stated that he did not vote \nin the Iraqi election. His statement to the OPM investigator and his response to the SOR \nabout voting in the Iraqi election were caused by Applicant\u2019s misunderstanding of and \n                                            \n8 When the SOR was written, the previous version of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (Aug. 30, \n2006) was in effect, and AG \u00b6 10(a)(7) stated, \u201c(7) voting in a foreign election\u201d was a disqualifying \ncondition. The Department of Defense eliminated that disqualifying condition and did not replace it with a \nsimilar specific disqualifying security concern relating to voting. Currently, voting in a foreign election does \nnot, in and of itself, raise a security concern. See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., \n547 U.S. 47, 57-58 (2006) (\u201cWe refuse to interpret the Solomon Amendment in a way that negates its \nrecent revision, and indeed would render it a largely meaningless exercise.\u201d); Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, \n397 (1995). Voting in an Iraqi election by itself does not necessarily \u201cconflict[] with U.S. national security \ninterests.\u201d \n\n \n15                                                                                                                                           \nconfusion about the English language. He did not intend to mislead security officials \nabout his connections and preferences concerning Iraq.    \n \nIn April 2014, Applicant assisted Iraqis citizens living in the United States for \nabout three days who were interested in voting in an Iraqi election. It is unclear what \nentity funded this employment. It might have been funded by the Iraqi Government. \nApplicant\u2019s involvement in the Iraqi election while living in the United States shows \nenough of a preference or interest in Iraqi politics to raise a foreign preference security \nconcern. See AG \u00b6 10(d). \n \nOne foreign preference mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 11 applies in this case, \n\u201c(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign citizenship that is \nin conflict with U.S. national security interests.\u201d Applicant stated that he is willing to or \nhas renounced his Iraqi citizenship. Foreign preference security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and C are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old linguist, and DOD contractors have employed him \nsince April 2015 in Iraq. Shortly after his hearing, he returned to Iraq to continue his \nlinguist duties. His annual salary as a linguist is $80,000. In 2006, he and his family \nmoved to the United States. In 2012, he and his spouse became U.S. citizens, and they \ntook the oath of allegiance to the United States. His employment and assets are located \nin the United States.  \n \n\n \n16                                                                                                                                           \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iraq must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers there.9 Iraq is a dangerous place because of violence \nfrom terrorists, and the Iraqi government does not respect the full spectrum of human \nrights. Terrorists continue to threaten the Iraqi government, the interests of the United \nStates, U.S. Armed Forces, and those who cooperate and assist the United States. The \nUnited States and Iraqi governments are allies in the war on terrorism. \n \nApplicant has indirect contact through his sister in Germany with his father and \nsister in Iraq. Contacts with family in foreign countries are a manifestation of one\u2019s care \nand concern for relatives living in those foreign countries. His relationships with \nresidents of Iraq raise important foreign influence security concerns. In 2014, he worked \nfor three days to help Iraqi citizens vote in an Iraqi election, raising an important foreign \npreference security concern. The foreign preference security concern is mitigated by his \noffer to renounce his Iraqi citizenship and his oath of allegiance to the United States. \n \nApplicant served as a linguist, translator, or cultural advisor in Iraq. He made \ncontributions at personal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Iraq. All these \ncircumstances increase the probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report \nany attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit \nhim. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). One colonel, one \nlieutenant colonel, and one major wrote letters lauding his professionalism, diligence, \nand honorable service to the United States in a combat zone. His base was bombed, \nand his patrol was fired upon three times. He received five certificates of appreciation \nfrom units in Iraq praising him for his contributions to mission accomplishment. His past \nhonorable service as a linguist and intention to continue that service weighs heavily \ntowards mitigation of foreign influence security concerns. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (affirming grant of security clearance and commenting \n\u201cApplicant has served as a translator and as a cultural liaison between Americans and \nAfghan citizens, diffusing tensions and facilitating transactions between the two groups. \n. . . Applicant put his life in danger on at least one occasion to protect American lives \nand interests in Afghanistan.\u201d). \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole \nperson. I conclude foreign influence and foreign preference security concerns are \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n                                            \n9 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd.

Feb. 12, 2003) (security \nclearance decisions must be based on current DoD policy and standards).4 DOD CAF \nadjudicators reviewed this case using the previous version of the adjudicative guidelines, \ndated September 1, 2006, which were in effect at the time. My decision and formal \nfindings under the revised Guideline F would not be different under the 2006 Guideline F.  \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to delete the \nallegations of failure to timely file federal and state returns from 2006 to 2015, so that the \nSOR would allege only that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state returns from \n2010 to 2015. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not object, and I granted the motion to amend.5 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 38 years old, a college graduate, unmarried, and with no children. \nSince March 2010, he has worked for a defense contractor.6 \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income \ntax returns for the tax years 2006 through 2015.7 Applicant answered that he filed his \n                                                          \n2 SEAD-4, \u00b6 B, Purpose.  \n \n3 SEAD-4, \u00b6 C, Applicability.  \n \n4 See also ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007) (when the guidelines were last revised, \nthe Board stated: \u201cQuasi-judicial adjudications must be made within the bounds of applicable law and \nagency policy, not without regard to them.\u201d) \n \n5 Tr. 7.  \n \n6 GE 1.  \n \n7 SOR \u00b6 1. \n \n\n3 \n \nfederal and state income taxes for 2006 through 2009 on time. Applicant admitted with \nexplanations that he did not timely file his federal and state for 2010 through 2015.8  \n \nApplicant testified that in September 2016 he suffered a life-threatening medical \ncondition and had to be resuscitated. The experience made him appreciate his family and \nhis friends at work. He did not, however, attribute that experience or any other medical \nreasons or other explanations for failing to timely file his 2010 to 2015 tax returns.9 \n \nInstead, Applicant blamed those failures to file timely on his opening of an online \ninvestment account in about 2009 or 2010. He was trying to buy some stock online. \nApplicant got locked out of his account and was told by the investment firm that he needed \nto verify his identity. So, he went to his credit union, which gave him a notarized document \nbut said it would not prove to the investment account that he was who he claimed to be. \nThe investment account told him he needed to go to a lawyer. At about this time, he \nwanted to prepare his tax returns and tried to log in to his investment account to get the \nproper forms for the IRS and state taxing authorities. Since taxes were routinely withheld \nfrom his paychecks, he did not anticipate owing any taxes. He did not believe, however, \nthat he could file his returns without having the forms from the investment account. And \nhe was not able to access those forms.10 \n \nApplicant testified about his background interview with the OPM investigator in \nApril 2016. Applicant discussed his tax filing problem, and the investigator asked if \nApplicant had funded the investment account.  Applicant said he had not, and he was told \nby the investigator that in that event, he did not need any forms from the investment \naccount to file his tax returns. Applicant did not realize that, and within a few months of \nthat interview, he had filed all late returns. He owed less than $1,000 in taxes.11 \n \nOn cross-examination, Applicant was asked that since he was an IT specialist, why \ncould he not access his investment account? He answered that because he was not an \nIT administrator for that account; only the investment firm\u2019s IT administrators could access \nhis account. Applicant was asked whether he sought help from a tax professional or a tax \npreparer. He answered that he did not, even though he knew his tax returns were due on \nApril 15 each year. He also said that lack of finances did not prevent him from seeking \nprofessional help with his taxes. Before opening the investment account, Applicant had \nalways timely filed his tax returns since 1998.12 \n                                                          \n8 Answer. \n \n9 Tr. 12, 31.  \n \n10 Tr. 13-15.  \n \n11 Tr. 15-18. Applicant also testified than he attended a FDIC Lending Smart Course regarding finances \nand taxes, and that going forward, will file all his tax returns on time. Id. 18. The record does not show \nwhen Applicant attended the FDIC course, before or after he filed his late returns. The most credible \ninference is that Applicant attended this course sometime after his OPM interview.  \n  \n12 Tr. 24-26, 30-31.  \n \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant was examined on why he failed to disclose on his security clearance \napplication in June 2016 that he had unfiled tax returns.13 He said that he was under \nstress from filling out the security clearance application and from the job-related stress of \nproviding IT support for over 200 individuals in his department.14  \n \nApplicant\u2019s attention was called to the summary report of his background interview \nin April 2016 when he told the investigator that he had been \u201clazy\u201d and could not get the \ntax documents from his investment account.15 Applicant testified that he did not like the \nword \u201clazy,\u201d that he was tired \u201cafter work,\u201d with a work day from 4:00 AM until after 5:00 \nPM (including commute).16  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to authorize \nsuch access. E.O. 10865 \u00a7 2; SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, \nconsidering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial \ndecision. SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(c), 2(d). \n \nDepartment Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \nAdministrative Judges are responsible for ensuring that an applicant receives fair \nnotice of the issues raised, has a reasonable opportunity to litigate those issues, and is \nnot subjected to unfair surprise. ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). \n                                                          \n \n \n13 Counsel for Applicant objected to this questioning, because it was not alleged in the SOR. I overruled \nthat objection, on the grounds that it went to the whole-person concept and to Applicant\u2019s credibility. Tr. \n28. Even though not alleged in the SOR, such matters may be considered on the issue of Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility. See ISCR Case No. 08-09232 at 3 (Sep. 9, 2010).  \n \n14 Tr. 33-34.  \n \n15 GE 2.  \n \n16 Tr. 34-35.  \n\n5 \n \nIn resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility, \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(b). See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has a number of delinquent debts, which \npurportedly raise a security concern under Guideline F. The financial considerations \nsecurity concern is explained at AG \u00b6 18, which in pertinent part, states: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  \n \n Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial \nissues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality \nto pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to \ndelinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person\u2019s \nself-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.17 \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f):   failure to file\u2026annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \n. . . as required; \n \n                                                          \n17 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).  \n \n\n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c):  the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g):    the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection or tax enforcement \nprocess. Rather, an administrative judge examines the way an applicant handles   \npersonal financial obligations to assess how they may handle their security obligations.18 \n\u201cFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with \nwell-established government rules and systems.\u201d19 Here, Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility was called into question by his history of failing to timely file his income tax \nreturns. I conclude that disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f) applies. The next inquiry is \nwhether any mitigating conditions apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file began with his obligation to file his 2010 tax returns in \n2011. That failure continued annually until after his background interview in April 2016, \nwhen he was told that he did not need any investment account forms to file his returns. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was not infrequent, nor did it occur that long ago. Therefore, AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. \n \n Applicant claimed that he failed to file, because he could not access his \ninvestment account for forms he believed necessary to file his returns. Even if I credit that \nas a circumstance largely beyond his control, the next inquiry is whether Applicant acted \nresponsibly under those circumstances.20 Confronted with this problem, however, he did \nnothing further to solve it. He did not seek professional help from a tax preparer or a tax \n                                                          \n18 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016). \n \n19 ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002).  \n \n20 That Applicant may have been \u201ctired after work\u201d is not a circumstance largely beyond his control.  Millions \nof taxpayers, many of whom may also be tired after work, are expected to comply with their annual income \ntax obligations. This is especially true of individuals who seek access to classified information.  \n\n7 \n \nadvisor. And Applicant admitted that his financial situation did not prevent him from \nseeking such assistance. Applicant knew that his tax returns were due on April 15 of each \nyear. He simply let each tax filing deadline go by, until he completed his security clearance \napplication and was interviewed by an OPM investigator. This is not responsible conduct. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant attended an FDIC Lending Smart Course regarding finances and taxes. \nOn this record it appears, however, that he did so after his background interview. \nNonetheless, I give him partial, but not complete, mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). \n \nThe record shows that once Applicant was alerted by the OPM investigator that he \ncould file his back returns, Applicant did so, and that he owed less than $1,000 in back \ntaxes. Even if I credit Applicant with bringing his tax obligations up to date under AG \u00b6 \n20(g), his history of late filing of federal and state income tax returns is not fully mitigated. \nApplicant \u201cdid not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required \nof persons granted access to classified information.\u201d21 \n \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.22 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      Against Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \n \n \n    Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n21 ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). \n \n22 AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  \n \n\n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to classified information.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPhilip J.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 18, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline J (criminal \nconduct) and Guideline E (personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG).1 \n1 I considered this case under the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. I also considered it under \nthe previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using either set \nof AG. \n04/11/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 31, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2018. The \ncase was closed due to loss of jurisdiction on January 23, 2018, as Applicant was \nseparated by his sponsor employer, a DOD contractor, in August 2017. The case was \nreopened and assigned to me on October 22, 2018, when Applicant was re-sponsored \nby another DOD contractor.  \n \nOn November 2, 2018, the Government amended the SOR pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 \nof the Directive, to add allegations under Guideline F (financial considerations), \nnumbered \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.m.

Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F, which I admitted in \nevidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until January \n4, 2019, for additional evidence. By that date, Applicant submitted additional \ndocumentation, which I marked collectively as AE G and admitted in evidence without \nobjection.

He was on a date with his child\u2019s mother at a sushi \nrestaurant. He drank sake for the first time. He did not feel intoxicated so he drove \nhome. As he approached his home, the road that he lived on was flooded. He \nunknowingly drove his car on top of a submerged tree, then called the police for \nassistance. The responding officer asked him if he had been drinking, and he said \u201cYes\u201d \nand disclosed that he had consumed a \u201ccouple of sak[e]s.\u201d The officer looked into his \neyes with a flashlight and administered a walk-and-turn sobriety test. The officer then \nplaced him in the front seat of the officer\u2019s car, without handcuffs, and drove him to the \nprecinct. There, he was administered a breathalyzer test and tested under the legal \nlimit. He received 18 months of probation before judgment, a $140 fine, and he was \nordered to attend alcohol-education counseling. He completed probation, paid the fine, \nand attended alcohol counseling; he did not receive an alcohol-related diagnosis.

He was living with his child\u2019s \nmother and they got into a verbal argument. She called the police and reported that he \nhit her on her leg, which he denied. The case was placed on a stet docket. In August \n2015, the case was taken out of the stet docket when he was again charged with \nsecond-degree assault (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.a). He testified that he and his child\u2019s mother got \ninto another argument, after she hit him on his head with a remote. He denied hitting \nher. He stated that \u201cShe was coming at me in an aggressive way,\u201d so he threw her \npurse at her, and the buckle of the purse scratched her forehead and caused her to \nbleed. When the police arrived, they immediately arrested him upon seeing the blood on \nher forehead. At trial, his child\u2019s mother admitted that she lied about the July incident \nand he was consequently found not guilty of that charge. He received 24 months of \nprobation before judgment for the August charge, and he was ordered to attend \ndomestic-violence counseling. He completed counseling in 2016 and probation in 2017. \nHe has since returned to the counseling program on invitation to share his experiences \nwith other attendees.7 \n \n \nIn June 2018, Applicant was charged with second-degree assault for the third \ntime (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 2.a). He testified that he told his child\u2019s mother that he no longer \nwanted her living with him. He then went to his weekly church group and returned to a \nvandalized home. He told her to take what she wanted but leave their son with him, \nsince he was the sole breadwinner. He grabbed her keys and got into a tug-of-war with \nher over her cell phone, which he wanted to keep because he paid for it. When he let go \n                                                     \n5 Tr. at 35-37; GE 4. \n \n6 Tr. at 37-43, 53-56; GE 1, 3, 5-8. \n \n7 Tr. at 43-56, 64-65; GE 1, 3, 9, 10. \n\n \n4 \n \nof the phone, he fell backwards onto the floor, and as he was standing up, she said \u201cyou \njust hit me, I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d He gathered his belongings and went to a friend\u2019s \nhouse to spend the night. In the morning, he reported to the police station to try to \nprovide his statement to any report that she might have filed the previous night. He was \ngiven the name and number of the reporting officer, because the officer was not at the \nstation, and he left the officer a voicemail. He returned to the station when the officer did \nnot return his call, and another officer was sent to his home later that day. That officer \ntold him that there was no police report filed and he was not charged. He was thus \nsurprised when he received a court summons reflecting that he had, in fact, been \ncharged with second-degree assault. His child\u2019s mother claimed in a police report that \nhe hit her and placed her in a headlock. He hired an attorney and intends to fight the \ncharge. The case was scheduled for a pre-trial hearing in December 2018.8 \n \n \nApplicant testified that the relationship between him and his child\u2019s mother ended \nin December 2017. As her name is still on the lease, she has continued to reside in their \nhome approximately two to three days out of the week. He unsuccessfully attempted to \nremove her name from the lease. He has known her since elementary school. They \ndated briefly in high school but fell out of touch when their families moved. They \nreconnected and began dating again in May 2014. He testified that he did not take the \ntime to get to know her, and he learned throughout the course of their relationship that \nshe has a criminal background, to include domestic-violence-related charges from \nprevious relationships. He also learned that \u201cthe way that she communicates is through \nviolence. And she\u2019s clever. I have to give that to her because she calls the police.\u201d He \ntestified that he never initiated any violence, as he is not a violent person. He has not \nbrought domestic-violence-related charges against her because she is his child\u2019s \nmother and does not want her to get into trouble.9  \n \n \nIn the future, Applicant intends to be more pragmatic in how he assesses and \nresponds to situations involving his child\u2019s mother, and to call the police if necessary. \nHe no longer intends to protect her at his expense. He does not have any other \ncriminal-related incidents. He testified that his employer was aware of his 2014 and \n2015 charges, but he had not yet reported his 2018 charge. While he was concerned \nabout the impact on his employment that the outcome of his 2018 charge would have, \nhe was not concerned about his employer finding out about it.10  \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges the following delinquent accounts: a medical debt of $478 \n(SOR \u00b6 3.a); eight student loans totaling $118,656 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.i); and four consumer \naccounts totaling $1,602 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.j-3.m). The debts are established by a 2018 credit \nbureau report. Applicant also disclosed his debts in his 2015 security clearance \napplication (SCA).11  \n                                                     \n8 Tr. at 56-63, 66-68, 72, 108-109; GE 11, 13. \n \n9 Tr. at 53-56, 60-62, 64-69, 78-83, 104-105, 107-109, 123-128; GE 1; AE G. \n \n10 Tr. at 53-56, 60-62, 64-69, 78-83, 104-105, 107-109, 123-128; GE 1; AE G. \n \n11 GE 1, 12; AE Q. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to being the primary provider from \napproximately 2014 to 2018 for his child, his child\u2019s mother, and her 10-year-old child \nfrom a previous relationship. He was also involved in a no-fault car accident in which his \ncar was totaled. He received $4,000 from the accident, but he had to apply it towards \nthe expense of obtaining another car. He attributed his minor medical debt to his \ninvoluntary termination.12 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a is for a $478 medical debt. Applicant testified that he believed he had \nhealth insurance after his involuntary termination from a previous employer. He \nindicated that he did not receive a bill for his visit to an urgent care center for strep \nthroat, and he was unaware of this debt until he received the SOR. He researched the \ndebt and intended to resolve it with his tax refund.13  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b through 3.i are for Applicant\u2019s eight defaulted student loans from his \nbachelor\u2019s degree, totaling approximately $118,656. He testified that he first learned \nthat his loans were in default when he began working with the credit-repair company \nLexington Law in May 2018 to resolve his delinquent accounts, as he did not receive \nany delinquent notices. He contacted the U.S. Department of Education after he \nreceived the amended SOR in November 2018, and he set up an income-based \npayment plan of $5 monthly for nine months to get his loans out of default. As of the \ndate of the hearing, he paid a total of $10 towards that plan; he also made a $10 \npayment in December 2018. He intended to continue to abide by the payment plan, and \nonce his loans were out of default, he intended to make timely monthly payments \ntowards his student loans.14 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.j and 3.k are for two credit cards in collection for a total of $827. \nApplicant testified that he cosigned the credit cards for his child\u2019s mother in \napproximately 2015. He intended to resolve them with his tax refund.15 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.l is for a charged-off credit-card account for $238. Applicant testified that \nhe was a victim of identity theft or hacking, so he closed his account with the creditor in \n2015. He testified that he is a claimant to a pending federal lawsuit against the creditor, \nand he believed the account would be resolved through the lawsuit. He testified that he \ndisputed the debt through Lexington Law. Since he canceled his subscription with \nLexington Law, he intended to dispute the debt directly with the credit bureaus.16 \n \n                                                     \n12 Tr. at 83-105, 108-113. \n \n13 Tr. at 83-85, 91-92; GE 12. \n \n14 Tr. at 92-99, 110-111; GE 12; AE D, E, F, G. \n \n15 Tr. at 102; GE 12. \n \n16 Tr. at 102-104; GE 12. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.m is for another charged-off credit-card account for $537. Applicant \ntestified that this debt is for his credit card, which he forgot about. He intended to \nresolve it with his tax refund.17 \n \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant worked as a financial analyst for his \ncurrent employer. He was promoted in October 2018. His annual income was $61,200. \nHe testified that he received financial counseling from three credit-repair companies, \nCredit Karma in 2016, and Credit Sesame and Lexington Law in 2018. He canceled his \nsubscription to Lexington Law because he did not find them helpful; however, he was \ncontinuing to monitor his credit through Credit Sesame. He has also received budget \ntraining at work, and he has a budget. He is current on his rent of $1,225 monthly and \nhis car payment of $360 monthly. He continues to be primarily responsible for his child\u2019s \nexpenses, as his child\u2019s mother does not contribute. After expenses, his monthly net \nremainder is approximately $500. He has a savings account with a balance of $140. He \nhas a retirement account with an unknown balance. He testified that \u201cI\u2019m just now \nstarting to really take control of my finances,\u201d whereas in the past five years, he focused \non his immediate, day-to-day expenses.18 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s previous supervisor described Applicant as an \u201cexceptional member \nof our team,\u201d and stated that he had \u201cfull confidence in [Applicant\u2019s] ability to maintain [a \nsecurity clearance].\u201d Applicant\u2019s pastor of ten years described Applicant as a highly \nprofessional and trustworthy individual. A friend of ten years described Applicant to be \nan \u201cupstanding, centered, and skilled gentleman.\u201d19 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n                                                     \n17 Tr. at 104; GE 12.  \n \n18 Tr. at 66-67, 69-72, 76-79, 83-92, 98-102; AE E, F. \n \n19 AE A, B, C. \n\n \n7 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 31. The following is potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 charge for driving with a suspended license is a traffic-related \noffense. He was found not guilty of his July 2015 assault charge, after his child's mother \nadmitted that she lied about the underlying incident. I find that AG \u00b6 31(b) does not \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d and I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2014 alcohol-related charges occurred after he admitted to an officer \nthat he had consumed alcohol prior to driving his car over a tree submerged under \nwater. He acknowledged that he was arrested and charged with assault in August 2015 \nafter the officers saw blood on his child\u2019s mother\u2019s forehead. He acknowledged that he \nthrew her purse at her and the buckle of the purse scratched her forehead causing her \nto bleed. His 2018 assault charge is pending. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \n1.e, and 1.f. \nThe potentially relevant mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are as follows:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant resolved his one-time alcohol-related charges in 2014 through \nprobation before judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c and I \nfind SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nThough Applicant resolved the August 2015 assault charge through probation \nbefore judgment, his 2018 assault charge is pending. I am thus unable to find that such \nconduct is unlikely to recur, that he did not commit the offenses, that there is evidence \nof successful rehabilitation, or that so much time has elapsed and it does not cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32(c), and 32(d) are \nnot established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n\n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) do not apply to the 2012 \ntraffic-related offense or the July 2015 assault charge in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d. For the \nreasons set forth above, AG \u00b6 16(c) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f, and AG \u00b6 \n16(e)(1) also applies to SOR \u00b6 1.f. While Applicant testified that he reported his 2014 \nand 2015 charges to his employer, and he was not concerned about his employer \nfinding out about his 2018 assault charge, he had not yet reported it to his employer. He \nwas concerned about the impact that the outcome of his 2018 charge would have on his \nemployment.   \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline J analysis, AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), \n17(d), and 17(e) are established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and \n17(e), and 17(f) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, and thus Applicant has \nnot established mitigation for SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n11 \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he believed SOR \u00b6 3.l would be resolved through \na pending federal lawsuit in which he is a claimant, as the debt was incurred because \nhe was a victim of identity theft or hacking. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to SOR \u00b6 3.l and I find \nSOR \u00b6 3.l in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his \ncircumstances. He sought and received credit counseling, and he was continuing to \nmonitor his credit as of the date of the hearing. However, while he learned that his \nstudent loans were in default in May 2018, he did not contact the U.S. Department of \nEducation until after he received the amended SOR in November 2018. As of the date \nof the hearing, he had just started his nine-month rehabilitation plan and his student \nloans remained in default. He had not yet done anything to resolve his remaining debts, \nas he intended to do so with his tax refund. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and \n20(d) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.k and 3.m. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n\n \n12 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude he has not mitigated the criminal conduct, personal \nconduct, and financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.m:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 30-year-old project manager employed by a defense contractor since July 2005, when he graduated high school. He married in September 2015, and he and his wife have a son, born November 2016. He seeks to retain the clearance he was issued in November 2005. Applicant used alcohol under questionable circumstances from June 2008 to July 2012, resulting in three incidents indicative of poor judgment. In June 2008, he was charged with operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol (SOR 1.a). He received and completed probation before judgment, and the charge was dismissed. In August 2011, he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, when he had a .12% blood alcohol content (SOR 1.c). He was otherwise satisfactorily completing the terms of his sentence when he was again charged with driving under the influence (.12% blood alcohol content), and speeding, in May 2012 (SOR 1.d). Because of this second arrest, Applicant was found to be in violation of the terms of his probation for the August 2011 arrest, and received additional punishment (SOR 1.e). Applicant ultimately completed the sentencing requirements of these arrests, and has been off probation for over three years (Tr. 39, AE A). Applicant\u2019s criminal record included a July 2010 driving on a suspended license charge which was nolle prossed (SOR 1.b), and a July 2012 3 citation for possessing alcohol in a campground (SOR 1.e).4 Between 2008 and 201",

I grant Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 27 September 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal\nConduct, Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a\n2\nhearing before the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).

On 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed Security\nExecutive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8 June 2017.\nThis decision is issued under the original AG, but I have examined the new AG to ensure that I would not\nreach a different result if I issued this decision under the new AG. I would not rule differently under either set\nof AG.\n1\n12/20/2018\n\nthe case to me 14 August 2017, and I convened a hearing on 28 September 2017.\nDOHA received the transcript 5 October 2017, and the record closed.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 30-year-old project manager \nemployed by a defense contractor since July 2005, when he graduated high school. He\nmarried in September 2015, and he and his wife have a son, born November 2016. He\nseeks to retain the clearance he was issued in November 2005.\nApplicant used alcohol under questionable circumstances from June 2008 to July\n2012, resulting in three incidents indicative of poor judgment. In June 2008, he was\ncharged with operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol (SOR 1.a). He received\nand completed probation before judgment, and the charge was dismissed. In August\n2011, he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, when he had a .12%\nblood alcohol content (SOR 1.c). He was otherwise satisfactorily completing the terms\nof his sentence when he was again charged with driving under the influence (.12%\nblood alcohol content), and speeding, in May 2012 (SOR 1.d). Because of this second\narrest, Applicant was found to be in violation of the terms of his probation for the August\n2011 arrest, and received additional punishment (SOR 1.e). Applicant ultimately\ncompleted the sentencing requirements of these arrests, and has been off probation for\nover three years (Tr. 39, AE A). Applicant\u2019s criminal record included a July 2010 driving\non a suspended license charge which was nolle prossed (SOR 1.b),  and a July 2012\n3\ncitation for possessing alcohol in a campground (SOR 1.e).4\nBetween 2008 and 2010, at a time Applicant was in an apprenticeship program\nwith his employer, Applicant used marijuana 2-3 times with coworkers. Applicant was\nnot aware that he had been granted a clearance in November 2005, but was aware that\nhe had applied for a clearance. Applicant has not used marijuana since 2010, and the\ncoworkers with whom he used marijuana are no longer employed by the company. \nApplicant acknowledged that his poor decisions reflect adversely on his\njudgment, but attributes them to his youth (Tr. 22, 42). However, he notes that since his\nmarriage and the birth of his son, his lifestyle has changed. His wife\u2019s family does not\nengage in the kind of misconduct that punctuated Applicant\u2019s youth, and he wants to set\na good example for his son and maintain the kind of good image his wife\u2019s family has.\nThe vice president of his company, who has known Applicant for over ten years, is\naware of his misconduct and recommends him for his clearance (Answer). He also\nsuccessfully completed a voluntary county outpatient substance abuse program in\nApplicant moved to a new state, and failed to comply with state requirements to transfer his license. His old \n3\nstate license was suspended, which was discovered during a routine traffic stop not otherwise alleged in the\nSOR.\nA park ranger observed a visitor to Applicant\u2019s campsite in possession of alcohol, a violation of campground\n4\nrules.  The visitor had left the campsite, but because the campsite was registered to Applicant, Applicant was\ncited, and paid a fine.\n2\n\nFebruary 2014, a program which included random drug and alcohol screenings, all of\nwhich were negative (Answer).\nPolicies\nThe AG list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for access to classified\ninformation. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nunder each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. Each decision must\nalso show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the factors listed in AG \u00b6\n2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case can be\nmeasured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or denial of a\nclearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant\nadjudicative guidelines are Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,\nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.5\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J, but\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. The dismissed July 2010 driving on a\nsuspended license charge and the July 2012 citation for possessing (constructively)\nalcohol in a campground lack security significance even under a disqualifying condition\nwhich contemplates a pattern of minor misconduct. However, three alcohol-related\narrests and a related probation violation constituted criminal conduct. Nevertheless, in\nthis case, even the combination of offenses does not raise any security concerns\nbeyond those considered under Guideline G, and while Applicant violated his probation\non his August 2011 arrest, he otherwise satisfactorily completed the court-ordered\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n3\n\nrequirements for that arrest as well as the other two arrests.  Moreover, even if I\n6\nconcluded that the disqualifying conditions were fully applicable, the corresponding\nmitigating conditions remove any security concerns.  Applicant completed all his\n7\nsentencing requirements and has an excellent employment record. Moreover, marriage,\nmaturity, and parenthood have had salutary influence on his life outlook. Accordingly, I\nresolve Guideline J for Applicant.\nIn similar fashion, the Government established a case for disqualification under\nGuideline G, by demonstrating Applicant\u2019s three alcohol-related arrests between June\n2008 and July 2012, the last of which triggered a probation violation.  Although the\n8\nrecord does not reflect a formal diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, such diagnosis is not\nrequired to raise a security concern.  Nevertheless, I find that Applicant has mitigated\n9\nthe security concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest was over six years aga, and he has not\nconsumed alcohol for several years. Thus, \u00b623(a) partially applies, in that I concluded\nthat enough time has passed and the conduct is unlikely to recur. However, while\n\u00b622(d)-(g) do not fully apply because there has been no documented diagnosis, and\n\u00b623(c)-(d) do not fully apply because of questions about the nature of Applicant\u2019s\ntreatment programs, \u00b623(b) fully applies.  Moreover, after his May 2012 charge,\n10\nApplicant took a different approach to his alcohol use problem. In addition to fully\ncomplying with the court requirements for education, Applicant voluntarily undertook a\nsubstance abuse program with the county, that he completed in 2014.\n\u00b631(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to affect a national security\n6\neligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness ; . . . (d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-ordered\nrehabilitation program;\n\u00b632(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened . . . that it is unlikely to recur and\n7\ndoes not cast doubt on the individuals\u2019 reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; (d) there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\nactivity, restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\nHowever, as with the criminal conduct concerns, the constructive alcohol possession citation does not really\n8\nhave any security significance under alcohol consumption as he was not consuming alcohol, and did not\nactually possess the alcohol.\n\u00b622(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\n9\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern . . .; (b) alcohol-related incidents at work,\nsuch as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition . . . regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; (c) habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment . . .; (d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional or mental\nhealth professional. . . of alcohol use disorder;\n\u00b623(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of\n10\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n4\n\n \nFurther, Applicant\u2019s character reference finds his reliability and work ethic to be\nexceptional. I conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse alcohol in the future. Accordingly, I\nresolve Guideline G for Applicant.\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s illegal drug abuse between 2008 and 2010, a period during\nwhich Applicant held a clearance, but Applicant mitigated the security concerns.11\nApplicant\u2019s drug use was essentially experimental, occurred right after high school, and\nended over seven years ago. Setting aside for the moment whether Applicant actually\nknew that he held a clearance, he knew that he had applied for one\u2014which put him on\nnotice of the Government\u2019s view of illegal drug use\u2014and it is unlikely his employer\ntolerated illegal drug involvement. Nevertheless, the drug use was minimal.\nDrug involvement mitigating conditions give much support to Applicant. His illegal\ndrug abuse was not recent, was not frequent, and seems unlikely to recur.  Applicant\u2019s\n12\nsubstance abuse program covered both his alcohol and marijuana use. All the use\noccurred before his marriage and parenthood, and with coworkers who are no longer\nwith the company.  Under the circumstances,  I conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse\n13\nillegal drugs in the future. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against Applicant.\nThe Government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E.\nThe conduct complained of\u2014the five criminal charges at SOR 1.a-1.e and the\nmarijuana use at SOR 3.a\u2014are fully cognizable as criminal conduct and drug use,\nrespectively. No critical mass is achieved by combining the two. The disqualifying\ncondition cited by the Government, \u00b616(d), is not satisfied.  Accordingly, I resolve\n14\nGuideline E for Applicant.\n \n\u00b625(a) any substance misuse; (c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . . ;(f) any illegal drug use\n11\nwhile granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position;\n\u00b626(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n12\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment [Emphasis supplied];\n\u00b626(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence\n13\nof actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not\nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used;\n\u00b616 (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be\n14\nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable, judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information. This included but is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3)\na pattern of . . . rule violations.\n5\n\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Given the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file \nFederal and state income tax returns for numerous years, his significant outstanding tax \ndelinquencies and unresolved promissory note, and the length of time they have been \nunresolved, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn February 5, 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn May 23, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. On June 8, \n2017, new AGs were implemented and are effective for decisions issued after that date.1  \n \n                                            \n1 I considered the previous AGs, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new AGs, effective June 8, \n2017. My decision would be the same if the case was considered under the previous AGs. \n12/17/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nOn September 21, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR, and requested a \nhearing. On March 28, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On June 28, 2018, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for July 25, 2018. Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits, Government \nExhibit (GE) 1-7, and Applicant offered ten exhibits, Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-J. There \nwere no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. On August 2, \n2018, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied all eight allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.h.   \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old licensed attorney. He honorably served in the U.S. Air \nForce on active duty from 1986 through 1992. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1985, a master\u2019s degree in 1987, and a juris doctorate in 2003. He is married and has \none adult child. He is sponsored for national security eligibility by a DOD contractor, for \nwhich Applicant is the Chief Executive Officer. (CEO) (Tr. 8-9; GE 1) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file state and Federal income tax \nreturns for multiple years. He owes three state tax debts, three Federal tax debts, and he \nhas an unsatisfied judgment. The combined total of Applicant\u2019s delinquent indebtedness \nis approximately $802,288. The record establishes the status of Applicant\u2019s unpaid \naccounts and untimely tax returns as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant failed to file state and Federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012. He denied this allegation \nin his SOR response because he has since filed all of his state and Federal income tax \nreturns. The testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant did not timely \nfile his state and Federal income tax returns for tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, \n2008, 2011, and 2012, as required. The income tax returns for tax year 2003 was filed in \n2006, and the income tax returns for tax years 2004 through 2008 were filed in 2009. Tax \nyears 2011 and 2012 income tax returns were filed in May 2014. (Tr. 10 -13, 49, 55, 89-\n91) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, c, and d allege Applicant had two state tax liens entered against him \nin 2013, and another state tax lien entered against him in 2016, in the combined total \namount of $37,097. Applicant denied these allegations in his response to the SOR. The \ntestimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant\u2019s state tax liens are unpaid \nand unresolved. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, and f allege Applicant had a Federal tax lien entered against him in \n2009, and another Federal tax lien entered against him in 2016, in the combined total \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \namount of $654,148. Applicant denied these allegations in his response to the SOR. The \ntestimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant\u2019s Federal tax liens are \nunpaid and unresolved. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent \n2005 income taxes in the amount of $20,225. He denied this allegation in his response to \nthe SOR. The testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that the Federal \nGovernment is currently claiming approximately $860,000 for Applicant\u2019s combined \ndelinquent Federal taxes. Applicant initiated a one-year repayment agreement to pay \n$500 per month to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) four weeks before his hearing. At \nthe time of his hearing, Applicant had not yet made any payments to the IRS for resolution \nof these delinquent taxes. (Tr. 15, 50, 72, 88, 92-93, 95; AE H; AE J) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant owes on a bank promissory note in the amount of \n$90,818. The bank filed a lawsuit against him in October 2014 to collect this debt. He \ndenied this allegation in his response to the SOR. The testimony and evidence at the \nhearing showed that this case is still pending litigation and the debt is unresolved. \nApplicant believes that he has repaid this debt in full and possibly overpaid the debt, but \nhe failed to provide evidence at the hearing showing his history of payments on this \naccount. Applicant claimed that he never received any statements from the bank and the \npayments on this note were automatically deducted from his bank account for years. He \ncalled his law partner as a witness since she represented Applicant during the litigation \nof the alleged promissory note, now valued at approximately $150,000. (Tr. 39) She \ntestified that the lawsuit was pending, and if she filed a motion to dismiss the case, she \nbelieved it would most likely be granted by the court. As of the date of the hearing, \nApplicant\u2019s attorney had not filed a motion to dismiss the case, and there was no evidence \npresented of Applicant\u2019s claimed payments on this account. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. \n20-21, 25-31, 33-35, 40, 77-78; AE A - G) \n \nApplicant stated that his financial problems stem from a catastrophic, million-dollar \nloss from a fire that damaged his rental property in 2003. He received a letter from his \ninsurance company the very day the fire occurred advising him that the insurance \ncompany would no longer insure his rental properties. Applicant suffered a heart attack \nshortly thereafter. He was financially ruined, and he borrowed $60,000 from his friends to \nsurvive. Applicant reported that he has repaid all that borrowed money to his friends. (Tr. \n10, 92) \n \nApplicant\u2019s office also burned in the fire, and he lost all business records. He did \nnot timely file state or Federal income tax returns for 2003, but he eventually filed those \nincome tax returns. He did not file his state and Federal income tax returns for tax year \n2004 because he was depressed, and he was on the verge of financial ruin. Applicant \neventually hired a certified public accountant (CPA). The CPA took Applicant\u2019s tax records \nand money, and made an appearance on his behalf before the IRS. About a year and a \nhalf later, the CPA kept the money, returned the tax records to Applicant, and told him he \ncould not help Applicant with his tax issues.  (Tr. 10-11) \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nApplicant hired a second CPA in about 2005, and he immediately noticed that his \nincome tax returns were finally being filed. The IRS requested to do an audit of Applicant\u2019s \nfiled 2009 and 2010 income tax returns. Applicant testified that he and his CPA met with \nan IRS representative. The IRS representative had Applicant sign a Power of Attorney \n(POA) for his CPA, and then she advised him that she would reschedule the audit. \nApplicant claimed the IRS representative instructed him not to open his mail from \nthe IRS because it would only upset him.  He thought that the IRS representative would \nsend the notices of the audits to Applicant and Applicant\u2019s tax representative(s), the CPA \nand eventually Applicant\u2019s sister, who is an IRS enrolled agent and was also added to \nApplicant\u2019s POA. (Tr. 11-13, 65-66, 84-85, 90) \n \nAfter an extended period of time, Applicant contacted his CPA to determine his \ncurrent tax status. The IRS audits for tax years 2009-2010 and 2012-2013 had already \noccurred when Applicant learned that the IRS failed to provide any notices of the audits \nto his tax representative(s). Applicant admitted that he had received an envelope from the \nIRS that contained the audit notice for both of his audits. He did not open any mail from \nthe IRS based on the advice he received from the IRS representative. Since no one \nappeared at the hearing for Applicant\u2019s Federal tax audits, all expenses reported on \nApplicant\u2019s 2009-2010, and 2012-2013 income tax returns were disallowed by the IRS for \ntax write-offs. (Tr. 12-13, 44, 64-70; AE I) \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, who is a tax expert, testified as a witness. She stated that the \nIRS agent\u2019s letter (AE I) pointed out that Applicant\u2019s CPA would not have been provided \na notice of the tax audit since her name was added to the POA in about 2016, which \nessentially cancelled the CPA on the POA. She also stated that, at one point in time, the \nCPA and she were both listed on the POA, but in late 2016 Applicant took action to have \nthe CPA\u2019s name removed from the POA. She believed Applicant\u2019s two audits, for tax \nyears 2009-2010 and 2012-2013, took place prior to her name being added on the POA, \nso she would not have received any of the audit notices. She did state that Applicant\u2019s \nCPA would have received these audit notices prior 2016. (Tr. 53) She testified that her \nbrother had talked with his CPA about the audit hearings and the CPA said he had it \nhandled. The CPA had obviously received the audit notices but he was not appearing at \nthe audit hearings, as he told her brother.2 (Tr. 58-59, 61) The audit for 2009-2010 tax \nyears would have most likely taken place in 2011 or 2012, and the audit for 2012-2013 \nwould have most likely taken place in 2014 or 2015. Applicant\u2019s sister filed Applicant\u2019s \n2016 and 2017 income tax returns. She stated that her brother owed taxes for both of \nthose tax years, but he did not pay the Federal taxes owed because he did not have the \nfunds. (Tr. 62)  She submitted a request for an audit reconsideration in September 2017 \nbut, as of the date of the hearing, the IRS had not yet responded to that request. (Tr. 42-\n47, 52-55, 58-63, 72; AE H; AE I) \n \n                                            \n2 Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony conflicts with Applicant\u2019s testimony that his CPA did not receive any audit \nnotices from the IRS. Applicant claimed that after the audits were over and no one appeared, he then \nreceived information from the IRS that showed he owed a horrendous amount of Federal taxes for those \naudited tax years. He admitted that he received the audit notices from the IRS. Applicant stated that his \nsister\u2019s testimony was in error. (Tr. 64-68, 73-74)  \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nApplicant stated that the total amount of Federal and state delinquent taxes were \nmerely unrealistic numbers due to his disallowed expenses. Applicant wishes to have his \ntax issues resolved so he can pay the actual tax money that is owed and be in complete \ncompliance. His most recent notice from the IRS disclosed that he currently owes \napproximately $860,000 for Federal tax liabilities. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) Applicant recently set-\nup a one-year repayment plan with the IRS covering tax years 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, \n2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, which includes all of the tax years with \ndelinquent Federal taxes owed. As of the date of his hearing, he had not yet made any \npayments on the one-year repayment plan. He noted that the state tax authority relies on \nthe Federal Government to determine an individual\u2019s tax liability. Once the Federal tax \nnumbers are correctly calculated, the state tax authority will then reset his state taxes, \ninterest, and penalties numbers. He has not yet made any payments on his outstanding \nstate taxes. (Tr. 13-15, 48-51; 61-62, 71, 76, 87-88; AE H, J) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Adverse \nclearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely based on whether the applicant has met the strict guidelines the \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Security Executive Agent have established for \nissuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I \nhave considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19, and the following \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant did not timely file his Federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012. The \nevidence also shows that he owes over $800,000 for delinquent taxes and an unresolved \npromissory note pending litigation. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012),  \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago,3 was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n                                            \n3 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant has not resolved his significant delinquent tax debt; nor has he paid, \nsettled, or resolved the bank promissory note pending litigation. He just recently entered \ninto a one-year repayment agreement with the IRS but has not yet started making his \nmonthly payments. Although he provided mitigating evidence of a fire and health \nconcerns during the 2003-2004 time period, which were circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, he does not have a reasonable explanation as to why he has been unable to \nresolve his tax issues during the past 14 years. Given the heavy burden generated by his \nfailure to timely file income tax returns or pay income taxes, the length of time the taxes \nhave been outstanding, and Applicant\u2019s unsubstantiated promise to resolve his debts, I \ncannot conclude that he has mitigated any of the financial considerations security \nconcerns. There are no indications that his tax and other financial problems are under \ncontrol, and I find it probable that future issues are likely to occur. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), (b), (c), (d) and 20(g) was not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nLooking at the totality of Applicant\u2019s tax history and circumstances, the evidence \nclearly shows that he does not possess the requisite good judgment, responsibility, and \ntrustworthiness required by individuals entrusted with protecting our nation\u2019s secrets. \nApplicant is a licensed attorney and should be expected to know and comply with his \nobligations under Federal and state tax laws. His self-serving explanation that he did not \nopen any mail from the IRS, to include important notices of his pending IRS audits, based \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \non an unsubstantiated and implausible claim concerning IRS representative\u2019s bad advice \nis purely irresponsible and unreasonable. \n \nGiven the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file Federal and \nstate income tax returns for numerous years, his significant outstanding tax and bank loan \ndelinquencies, and the length of time they have been unresolved, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n       Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n PAMELA C. BENSON \n \n \n \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 20, 2017, Applicant owed delinquent debt totaling $44,184 on nine accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i). In response to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted three consumer credit debts of $15,449 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $4,743 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and $6,126 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He denied owing a $131 satellite-television debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a $1,323 medical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a $765 charged-off balance (SOR \u00b6 1.f), a delinquent mortgage past due for $13,748 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), a $1,183 utility debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and a $666 collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i). After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 55-year-old extrusion engineer with a general equivalency diploma. He has worked for a defense contractor since July 2015. He testified that he held a clearance that was withdrawn, but he does not know the level. (Tr. 34-35.) He was married 3 to his first wife from August 1991 to October 2009, and has a 21-year-old son from that union. He has a 37-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. Applicant and his current spouse began cohabiting in September 2011. They married in September 2018. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 30.) Applicant worked as a vice president of sales for his brother\u2019s company from October 1994 to July 2009.

The financial considerations security concerns are not yet \nmitigated. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn November 20, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 29, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On April 23, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for May 16, 2018. \n \n \nApplicant failed to appear at his hearing scheduled for May 16, 2018, for medical \nreasons unknown to the Government before the hearing date. On May 29, 2018, I sent a \ncertified letter to Applicant advising him that I would reschedule his hearing, but only for \ngood cause. On June 4, 2018, I received documentation confirming that Applicant was on \napproved disability from April 4, 2018, through at least June 17, 2018. I granted a \ncontinuance at Applicant\u2019s request. On August 6, 2018, I rescheduled his hearing for \nSeptember 19, 2018, advising him to note the change in location from the hearing \nscheduled for May 2018. \n \nApplicant did not show for his hearing on September 19, 2018. He went to the \nlocation of his hearing scheduled for May 2018, because he had lost the amended notice \nnoting the change in location. With no objection from the Government, on January 15, \n2019, I issued yet another amended notice, scheduling his hearing for February 13, 2019.  \n \nAt the hearing held as rescheduled on February 13, 2019, four Government exhibits \n(GEs 1-4) were admitted in evidence. A December 20, 2017 letter forwarding the proposed \nGEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were marked as hearing exhibits (HEs I and II) for \nthe record, but were not admitted for evidentiary purposes. Applicant submitted one exhibit \n(AE A) and testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 27, 2019. \n \nI held the record open to March 15, 2019, for post-hearing submissions from \nApplicant. On March 13, 2019, he submitted AEs B-G, which were admitted in evidence \nwithout any objections. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 20, 2017, Applicant owed \ndelinquent debt totaling $44,184 on nine accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i). In response to the \nSOR allegations, Applicant admitted three consumer credit debts of $15,449 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), \n$4,743 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and $6,126 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He denied owing a $131 satellite-television \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a $1,323 medical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a $765 charged-off \nbalance (SOR \u00b6 1.f), a delinquent mortgage past due for $13,748 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), a $1,183 \nutility debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and a $666 collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i). \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old extrusion engineer with a general equivalency diploma. \nHe has worked for a defense contractor since July 2015. He testified that he held a \nclearance that was withdrawn, but he does not know the level. (Tr. 34-35.) He was married \n\n3 \n \nto his first wife from August 1991 to October 2009, and has a 21-year-old son from that \nunion. He has a 37-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. Applicant and his \ncurrent spouse began cohabiting in September 2011. They married in September 2018. \n(GE 1; AE A; Tr. 30.) \n \nApplicant worked as a vice president of sales for his brother\u2019s company from \nOctober 1994 to July 2009. In July 2009, he left his job paying him $90,000 annually to \nstart his own extrusion business in another part of their state. The expectation was that his \nbrother would refer business to him. (GE 1; Tr. 37-38, 41-42.) In October 2009, Applicant \npurchased a home in his new area. He made a down payment of $25,000 and obtained a \nmortgage loan of $144,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) to be repaid at $1,302 monthly. (GEs 1-4; Tr. 63-\n64.) In December 2009, he charged $1,088 on a jewelry store account for earrings (not \nalleged in SOR). In October 2010, he bought a snowmobile, obtaining a loan for $11,264, \nto be repaid at $228 per month (SOR \u00b6 1.d). In December 2011, he bought a car with a \nloan of $16,439 (not alleged in SOR). Applicant relied on credit cards obtained in August \n1987 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and January 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) for household needs. (GEs 2-4; AE A; Tr. \n47.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s income from his business was about $40,000 a year at first. It never \nexceeded $100,000. He incurred unexpected expenses in renting a building that did not \nhave adequate electrical voltage to run the equipment needed for his business. (Tr. 38-40.) \nHe had to buy a transformer that cost $25,000, which was delayed in its delivery. It put his \nbusiness behind at the start. (Tr. 38-40.) Then Applicant\u2019s brother stopped sending him \nbusiness. Applicant\u2019s income dropped to $10,000, and he began to default on some \nfinancial obligations. (Tr. 65-66.) \n \nApplicant made no payments after February 2012 on the snowmobile (SOR \u00b6 1.d), \nand the recreational vehicle was subsequently repossessed. The deficiency balance on his \nloan was charged off for $4,743 and placed for collection in November 2012. (Tr. 56.) His \ncredit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.c became seriously delinquent in October 2012 and was \ncharged off for $15,000. He had a second account with the creditor opened in September \n1987 with a high credit of $254 that had been closed due to inactivity in September 2012. \nHe made a last payment on his credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.e in March 2012, and the creditor \ncharged off his account for $6,126 in May 2012. Applicant stopped paying on his jewelry \ndebt in early 2013, and his account was charged off for $733 in approximately July 2013. \n(GEs 1-4.) \n \nIn early 2013, Applicant\u2019s business lost its biggest customer. (Tr. 25-26, 40.) Around \nFebruary 2013, Applicant had a heart attack.1 He incurred a $1,323 ambulance charge that \nhe did not repay. He was not held responsible for repayment of his other medical bills \nbecause his income was minimal. (Tr. 49.) \n \n                                                 \n1 Applicant testified that he had a heart attack in 2014, shortly before he went to work for the trucking \ncompany. (Tr. 49-50.) Available credit reports show that the medical bill at issue is from February 2013. (GEs \n2-3.) According to his SF 86, he began working for the trucking company in 2013. (GE 1.) His present \nrecollection of the 2014 date appears to be inaccurate. (Tr. 81.) \n\n4 \n \nIn July 2013, Applicant closed his business. He used his retirement savings to pay \nhis business creditors. (Tr. 68.) He paid off a personally-guaranteed business loan of \n$77,090 in September 2013. (GE 3.) He made no payments toward his mortgage loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g) after July 2013, however, and he vacated the property in September 2013. As \nof April 2014, his loan was $13,748 past due on a balance of $136,203. (GEs 1-4.) \nApplicant testified that he was told when he vacated the property \u201cthat would be fine.\u201d He \nhad about $20,000 in equity in the property. (Tr. 27, 69-71.) \n \nFrom July 2013 to June 2015, Applicant worked as a truck driver earning \napproximately $50,000 annually. (GE 1; Tr. 26, 36.) In October 2013, his car was \nrepossessed, and his account was charged off. (GEs 1-4.). He borrowed $20,000 from his \nbrother to purchase a used car. According to Applicant, his brother does not expect to be \nrepaid. (Tr. 78-79.) A satellite-television debt of $131 from January 2015 was charged off \nand then placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a). A credit-card account opened in May 2015 \nbecame delinquent in July 2015, and a $696 debt was charged off and placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i). (GEs 1-4.) \n \nIn July 2015, Applicant began working for his defense-contractor employer. On \nAugust 31, 2015, he completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86). In response to financial inquiries regarding any \ndelinquency on routine accounts, he indicated that he owed past-due credit-card debts of \n$6,126 (SOR 1.e), $15,449 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and $733 for jewelry (not alleged in SOR). \nApplicant indicated that he owed nothing on his defaulted snowmobile, car, and home \nloans. Concerning his defaulted mortgage loan, he indicated that his loan was resolved in \nApril 2014, when he returned the keys to the property (SOR \u00b6 1.g). He attributed his \nfinancial delinquencies to his business loss and expressed his intention to repay his credit-\ncard debts. He also related that he was discussing possible options with an attorney about \nthe credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (GE 1.) At his hearing, he elaborated that he had \ndiscussed filing for bankruptcy with an attorney, but he felt at the time that he would get a \nchance to repay his creditors. (Tr. 48.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on September 5, 2015, revealed that his $15,449 and \n$6,126 credit-card debts, his $4,743 snowmobile loan balance, and his $1,323 medical \ndebt from February 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) were in collection. His defaulted mortgage was \n$13,748 past due as of April 2014. A credit card was past due 30 days for $50 on a $468 \nbalance (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Applicant was making timely payments on two credit cards with \nbalances of $4,088 with creditor X and $584 with creditor Y. (GE 2.) \n \nOn October 6, 2015, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked about his delinquent accounts, \nApplicant admitted that he owed the $15,449 and $6,126 credit-card debts. He asserted \nthat he owed nothing on the defaulted jewelry account, snowmobile loan, or mortgage loan. \nWhen confronted about the $1,323 medical debt, Applicant indicated that it was an \nambulance bill that he was disputing because the ambulance broke down while \ntransporting him to the hospital. As for the credit card that was past due for $50 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.i), Applicant explained that he was having trouble contacting the creditor to repay the \n\n5 \n \ndebt. He expressed a plan to start making monthly payments toward his delinquencies by \nJanuary 2016, and to attempt to verify his disputed debts. He described his financial \nsituation as stable and catching up. (AE A.) \n \nIn February 2016, the credit-card account that had been past due for $50 was \nplaced for collection for $696 with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.i. In April 2016, a utility provider \nplaced a $1,183 debt for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (GE 3.) Applicant claims that the debt was \nincurred by subsequent tenants after he moved out of the apartment (Tr. 71), but he \nsubmitted no proof, and it is on his credit report. In April 2016, Applicant opened a credit- \ncard account, which had a current balance of $535 as of July 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). As of \nAugust 2016, Applicant was making timely payments to creditor X toward a $3,376 \nbalance. (GE 3.)  \n \nAs of November 15, 2017, Equifax reported no progress toward resolving the \ndelinquencies in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s foreclosed mortgage loan was listed as $13,748 past \ndue as of April 2014 with no recent update. The balance on the defaulted snowmobile loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) had accrued to $7,488. The $131 satellite-television debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) had \nbeen placed for collection in March 2017, and was listed as unpaid as of November 5, \n2017, although Applicant testified at his hearing that he paid the debt by check \u201ca couple of \nyears ago.\u201d (Tr. 43.) His account with creditor X was current with a $3,293 balance. The \naccount has a credit limit of $3,300. (GE 4.) As of August 2015, his credit limit on the \naccount was $4,000. (GE 2.) \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified about the delay in addressing his past-due debts \nthat \u201cthings are just coming up in my life that are out of my control, and you know, take \nprecedence over paying debts off.\u201d (Tr. 25.) He had a motorcycle accident while on \nvacation visiting his brother in February 2018, and he was out of work on disability for \nabout eight months. (Tr. 25, 28, 74-75.) His disability income was \u201cbasically the same\u201d as \nhis employment income, but it was paid out in lump sums. (Tr. 28.) His friends raised about \nthree months\u2019 rent for him when he was in the hospital being treated for a traumatic brain \ninjury following his accident. (Tr. 29.) \n  \nOn March 13, 2019, Applicant stated that the credit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.c and \nthe defaulted mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.g) were being removed from his credit report. (AE B.) A \nrecord from the creditor (AE D) indicates that it could not verify an account ending in \nx36423. (AE D.) That account number matches that of the account that was closed in 2012 \ndue to inactivity and not the account ending in x23183, on which Applicant owes a $15,449 \nbalance. Applicant admitted that he has paid nothing on the credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, \nbut he is not receiving any collection notices. (Tr. 47, 55.) Concerning the defaulted \nmortgage, documentation from the creditor indicates only that Applicant was provided with \nthe company\u2019s credit retraction fax number so that they could attempt to resolve his inquiry. \n(AE E.) Applicant testified that the debt should no longer be on his credit report because \nthe house was sold for more than what he paid for it. (Tr. 77.) Applicant presented \ndocumentation showing that his spouse had delinquent cellphone (AE F) and cable \ntelevision (AE G) accounts that were settled in November 2017. On March 11, 2019, \nApplicant made a $1,000 payment to creditor X. (AE C.) \n\n6 \n \nApplicant indicates that he had an agreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e to settle \nhis $6,126 debt for $3,500. (AE B.) At his hearing, he testified that, a few months ago, he \nwas told he could settle the debt for $3,000, and he told the creditor that he would respond \nwhen he had the money to settle it. (Tr. 57.) Applicant asserts that he had reached out to \nthe creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d but had no payment plan in place to address his defaulted \nsnowmobile loan; that he paid $131 to resolve the satellite-television debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that \nthe utility provider in SOR \u00b6 1.h was still trying to locate his account; and that he was still \ntrying to connect with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f about that credit-card debt that he now \nbelieves has not been paid. Applicant added that it was going to take some time to address \nhis debts, but that he is \u201con top of it.\u201d (AE B.) Applicant understands that he has to repay \nthe ambulance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b), but he believes the ambulance company should be held \naccountable because the ambulance broke down on the highway when he was having a \nheart attack. (Tr. 45-46.) He acknowledges that he has made no payment on the credit- \ncard debt in collection with the entity in SOR \u00b6 1.i. (Tr. 72.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s son currently attends a community college. Applicant cashed in his life \ninsurance policy of $26,000 to pay his son\u2019s tuition. Applicant gives his son about $100 a \nweek for his college expenses. (Tr. 32-33.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current salary with the defense contractor is $75,000. He has earned \nbonuses annually of about $2,500. (Tr. 35-36.) He estimates that he owes approximately \n$5,000 in medical bills as a result of his accident. He also will have some medical bills for a \nprocedure in January 2019, although he expects them to be minimal because he has \nmedical insurance. (Tr. 52-54.) He returned to work the day following the procedure. (Tr. \n54.) For the most part, he lives from paycheck to paycheck. When he has extra money, he \ntries to pay off debts. (Tr. 76.) As of his hearing in February 2019, he had about $9 in his \nchecking account. (Tr. 79.) His spouse receives about $900 a month in Social Security \nDisability income. (Tr. 82.) Applicant and his spouse pay $1,800 per month in rent. (Tr. 83.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n7 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \n\n8 \n \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nAvailable credit information establishes that Applicant incurred the delinquencies \nalleged in the SOR. It is unclear whether the mortgage delinquency is still owed. The debt \nwas on his credit report as $13,748 past due as of November 2017, but the information \nabout the delinquency was from April 2014. Applicant testified that the house was sold for \nmore than what he paid for it, although he provided no proof of the sale. Even so, he does \nnot dispute that he stopped paying on the mortgage loan and lost the house. His record of \ndelinquent accounts establishes disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \nThe applicability of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions shifts the burden to \nApplicant to demonstrate that one or more of the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n20 applies: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies only in that some of the debts first became delinquent more than \nfive years ago. Applicant stopped paying on the credit cards in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e and the \nsnowmobile loan in 2012. The ambulance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) is from February 2013. His last \n\n9 \n \npayment on the mortgage loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g) was in July 2013. However, his failure to \naddress these past-due debts constitutes continuing conduct of security concern that is not \nmitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). The satellite-television debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, the credit-card debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.i, and the utility debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h, which are all from 2015, and the credit-card \ndelinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.e from 2016, are evidence of recent financial problems that cast \ndoubt on his judgment and reliability and are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \n \nApplicant has a case for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). The debts that became \ndelinquent in 2012 and 2013 were caused by the failure of his business. Applicant could \nnot control economic conditions in his area or the decisions of others (his brother and his \nbiggest customer) that led to a significant loss of business for his company and the \nconsequent decline in his income. Even so, in starting his own business, Applicant took a \nrisk that it may not be financially profitable. The ambulance debt resulted from a medical \nemergency, which is a circumstance contemplated within AG \u00b6 20(b). Regarding those \naccounts that became delinquent in 2015 or 2016, it is unclear what was transpiring that \ncaused him to fall behind so seriously on his utility costs or to cease paying in July 2015 on \nthe credit card placed with the collection entity in SOR \u00b6 1.i and in November 2016 on the \ncredit card in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \n \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component of good financial management is whether an \nindividual maintains contact with his or her creditors and attempts in good faith to arrange \nfor repayment. In that regard, Applicant\u2019s evidence falls considerably short of showing any \nongoing contact with his creditors. He claims that he paid the $131 satellite-television debt \na couple of years ago, but his November 2017 credit report shows the debt as unpaid. The \ncellphone and cable bills that were settled in November 2017 were his spouse\u2019s debts. \nEven though Applicant may reasonably be excused from addressing his delinquent \naccounts while he was out of work for eight months following his serious motorcycle \naccident in 2018, he has known since his August 2015 SF 86 that his delinquencies were \nof concern to the DOD, and he was not proactive about his debts after he returned to work. \nAlthough he had medical treatment in January 2019, he apparently returned to work the \nfollowing day. He had a hearing for September 2018 that was rescheduled, and yet he \ninexplicably took little action before his February 2019 hearing to address the issues that \nhave been of concern to the DOD for several years. \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) has been shown to fully apply without a track \nrecord of repayment. There is no evidence that Applicant is being pursued for any \ndeficiency on the delinquent mortgage loan. Abandonment of a financial obligation is not a \ngood-faith effort to resolve a debt. Applicant presented no documentation to establish that \nthe debt was resolved through a foreclosure sale that could mitigate the debt under AG \u00b6 \n20(e). Even if that debt is no longer owed, his other past-due debts total more than \n$30,000, which is a significant debt burden for Applicant, who is living largely from \n\n10 \n \npaycheck to paycheck. Promises to pay a debt at some future date are not a substitute for \nfinancially responsible behavior. The Appeal Board has held that applicants who only begin \nto address their financial issues when their personal interests are at stake may not comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations when their immediate interests are not imperiled. See \nISCR Case No. 17-01382 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) and ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2018). Applicant lacks a documented track record of timely payments that \ncould alleviate the concerns for his financial judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not a proceeding designed to \ncollect debts. Applicant has worked for his employer since July 2015, and I have no reason \nto doubt his assertion that he is dedicated to his duties. He indicates that he will continue to \nclean up his credit. Had he not waited until February and March 2019 to take action, he \nwould perhaps have been in a better position to demonstrate that he has established a \nplan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement it.  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an \napplicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) \n(citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once \na concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons noted, I am unable to conclude that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n11 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it not is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance and \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 15, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On December 23, 2016, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information \n(December 29, 2005) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive, effective September 1, 2006.1  \n01/24/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), J \n(Criminal Conduct), and F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD \nCAF was unable to make an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether such \neligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 10, 2017. In a sworn statement, dated \nJanuary 30, 2017,2 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was \nprepared to proceed on March 8, 2017. The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. \nA Notice of Hearing was issued on August 28, 2018, scheduling the hearing for \nSeptember 24, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 7 and Administrative \nExhibit I were admitted into evidence without objection. No Applicant exhibits (AE) were \noffered. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 17, 2019.3 I kept \nthe record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that \nopportunity and timely submitted several documents, which were marked and admitted \nas AE A through AE O, without objection. The record closed on October 29, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with limited comments, nearly all of \nthe factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.d., and 1.f.); he failed to admit or deny one allegation pertaining to personal conduct \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e.), so a denial was registered for him; he admitted, with limited comments, \nnearly all of the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through \n2.c.); he failed to admit or deny one allegation pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.d.), \nso a denial was registered for him; and he admitted several allegations pertaining to \nfinancial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.i. through 3.n.). He denied, with limited comments, all \nof the remaining allegations.  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \neight additional factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.o. \n                                                          \n1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December \n10, 2016, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or \ncontinued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, were \nestablished to supersede all previously issued national security adjudicative criteria or guidelines. \nAccordingly, those guidelines previously implemented on September 1, 2006, under which this security \nclearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the two versions, there is no substantial \ndifference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case. \n \n2 Although the pre-printed form upon which Applicant selected the chosen forum was dated 2016, \nit is clear that if the SOR was issued in December 2016, he could not have received it in January 2016. \n \n3 Although a copy of the purported transcript was received on October 2, 2018, while the cover of \nthe transcript was the one for this case, the contents were associated with a different case. Upon \ndetermining the error, the correct transcript was electronically transmitted to me on January 17, 2019. \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nthrough 3.v.). There being no objection, the motion was granted.4 Applicant was afforded \n20 days to respond to the new allegations. He failed to admit or deny any of the added \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations, so denials were registered for him. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a missile assembler with his current employer since October 2004. Although he \nattended high school for six years, in 2000, he received a certificate of completion, but \nnot a diploma. He has never served in the U.S. military. He was granted a secret \nclearance in 2004. Applicant has never married, but he has resided with a cohabitant for \nan unspecified period, and he had four children, born in 2002, 2004, 2008, and 2015, \nrespectively. \n \nPersonal Conduct and Criminal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant has a lengthy history of disregarding laws, rules, and regulations. The \nSOR alleged nine incidents of criminality and personal conduct by Applicant commencing \nin 2006, and continuing until at least 2016.  \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 3.n.): In June 2006, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving with \nSuspended License, 2) Operating a Vehicle without Insurance, and 3) Switched Tag. He \nwas convicted and fined.5 He was granted a payment plan. While he paid $35 associated \nwith the Switched Tag conviction, he failed to pay the remaining $256 for that charge, and \nthe $306 and $356 for the other charges.6 \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 3.n.): In July 2012, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving while \nLicense Suspended, and 2) Operating a Vehicle without Insurance. He was convicted \nand fined.7 He was granted a payment plan. While he paid $356 for the Insurance charge, \nand $244 associated with the Suspended License conviction, he failed to pay the \nremaining $62 for that charge.8  \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 3.n.): In July 2013, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving with \nLicense Revoked, 2) Operating a Vehicle without Insurance, and 3) Expired Tag. He was \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 12-14. \n \n5 GE 6 (Municipal Record Search, dated October 21, 2016). \n \n6 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1.  \n \n7 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n8 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nconvicted and fined.9 He was granted a payment plan. His fines of $306 for the Revoked \nLicense, $356 for the Insurance, and $206 for the Expired Tag remain unpaid.10  \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 3.n.): In October 2013, Applicant was charged with Contempt of \nCourt associated with his failures to pay his outstanding fines. In March 2014, after he \npaid $35 in fees and court costs, the charge was nolle prossed.11  \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.f., and 3.n.): In January 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith 1) Driving with License Revoked, 2) Failure/Refusal to Display Insurance, and \nExpired Tag. He was convicted and fined.12 He was granted a payment plan. His $306 \nfine for Revoked License, $356 fine for Insurance, and his $206 fine for Expired Tag \nremain unpaid.13 Applicant failed to self-report his arrest to his security manager of facility \nsecurity office.14 \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. and 3.n.): In September 2014, Applicant was again charged with \nContempt of Court associated with his failures to pay his outstanding fines. In November \n2014, a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was eventually ordered to pay $303 in fees \nand court costs, but that amount remains unpaid.15  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g.): In December 2015, a coworker brought a shocking pen into the work \narea. Applicant took the device from the coworker and entered another work area where \nhe attempted to \u201cprank\u201d another employee. Human Resources determined that Applicant \nhad conspired to be untruthful in an interview when he was questioned about his level of \ninvolvement in the incident. Applicant was subsequently issued a written warning for \nfailure to comply with the company\u2019s guidelines for professional conduct.16 Applicant \ndenied both the allegation and taking the device into the work area, claiming the incident \nwas incorrectly reported.17 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 2.c.): Although he is aware that it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle \nwithout a driver\u2019s license, when he is unable to obtain transportation to and from work \n                                                          \n9 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n10 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n11 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n12 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n13 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n14 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1. \n \n15 GE 6, supra note 5. \n \n16 GE 5 (Incident History, dated September 29, 2016). \n \n17 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; Tr. at 74-76. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nwith a coworker, to avoid being fired from his job, Applicant admitted that he takes the \nrisk and has continued to drive unlawfully since his 2014 arrest.18 \n \nFinancial Considerations19 \n  \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to several factors: he is a single father; \nhe and his children reside with Applicant\u2019s grandmother \u2013 the individual who raised him \n\u2013 in her house; his girlfriend refused to allow him to get a tag for the vehicle in her name \nfor which he had cosigned; and in 2012, his girlfriend left him and the children. Although \nnot cited by him as a contributing factor to his financial problems, three or four years ago, \nfor Christmas, Applicant purchased an unspecified number of all-terrain-vehicles (ATVs) \nfor his children, each costing $5,000 to $6,000.20 For reasons not explained other than \nexperiencing \u201crough times,\u201d in addition to the traffic fines and fees that remain unpaid, \nother accounts became delinquent.  \nThe SOR, as amended, identified 21 purportedly delinquent accounts, including \nunpaid court fines and fees, which had been placed for collection, charged off, or filed as \njudgments, as generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s December 2010, June 2016, or \nSeptember 2018 credit reports. Those debts total approximately $48,677. The current \nstatus of the non-court fines and fees accounts is as follows: \nThere are six delinquent accounts that were placed for collection and filed as \njudgments that were eventually partially or fully satisfied by garnishments: $5,028 (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 3.c. and 3.l.); $1,048 (SOR \u00b6 3.d.); $1,400 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e. and 3.m.); $1,025 (SOR \u00b6 \n3.f.); $5,064 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.g. and 3.i.); and $1,149 (SOR \u00b6 3.h.).21 There has been no change \nin the status of a vast majority of Applicant\u2019s accounts that were placed for collection, \nmost of which were charged off with unpaid balances: $4,787 (SOR \u00b6 3.a.); $374 (SOR \n\u00b6 3.b.); $2,167 (SOR \u00b6 3.o.); $1,385 (SOR \u00b6 3.p.); $2,088 (SOR \u00b6 3.q.); $9,073 (SOR \u00b6 \n3.r.); $6,154 (SOR \u00b6 3.s.); $418 (SOR \u00b6 3.t.); $175 (SOR \u00b6 3.u.); and $714 (SOR \u00b6 3.v.).22 \n                                                          \n18 GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated May 18, 2016), at 3; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, \nsupra note 1; Tr. at 72. \n \n19 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: GE 2, supra note 18; GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit \nReport, dated December 30, 2010); GE 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated June 28, 2016); GE 7 (Equifax \nCredit Report, dated September 21, 2018); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1.   \n  \n20 Tr. at 56-57. \n \n21 GE 3, supra note 19; GE 4, supra note 19; GE 7, supra note 19; AE A (Garnishment File, various \ndates); AE B (Satisfaction of Judgment, dated October 16, 2018); AE C (Garnishment File, various dates); \nAE D Civil Fee Sheet, dated September 28, 2018); AE E (Garnishment File, various dates); AE F (Order, \ndated May 27, 2010); AE G (Order, dated June 9, 2009); AE H (Garnishment File, various dates); AE I (Civil \nFee Sheet, dated September 28, 2018); AE J (Garnishment File, various dates). See also GE 5, supra note \n15. \n \n22 GE 7, supra note 19; Tr. at 55. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nApplicant claimed he made some payments to creditors, and he contended that in \nMarch 2018 he engaged the professional services of a debt relief organization to resolve \nhis delinquent accounts, and that he pays that organization $400 per month for their \nservices.23 Although Applicant stated an intention to submit documentation regarding his \nrelationship with the debt relief company; the status of all of his delinquent accounts; \npayment plans established with his creditors; and payments made to creditors by himself \nor in his behalf, no such documentation was submitted.  \nApplicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement to reflect his monthly net \nincome; monthly expenses; and a monthly remainder available for discretionary saving or \nspending. He reported that his monthly net salary was about $2,731.80, and his monthly \nexpenses, including $500 child support, and $600 for debt relief and credit cards, was \n$2,450.24 That leaves him approximately $282 per month available for discretionary \nsaving or spending. There is no evidence of financial counseling. \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d25 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d26   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n                                                          \n \n23 Tr. at 48-52. \n \n24 AE N (Personal Financial Statement, undated). \n \n25 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n26 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d27 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.28  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, \u201csecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d29  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d30 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n27 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n28 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n29 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n30 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including those in the DOD CAF \ncase file, those submitted by Applicant, his testimony, as well as an assessment of \nApplicant=s demeanor and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal \nprecepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in \nthe SOR: \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security concerns: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \nBetween 2006 and 2014, Applicant established a lengthy pattern of criminality \ninvolving repeated traffic-related violations for which he was charged, convicted, and \nfined. His repeated failures to pay his court fines and costs resulted in two charges of \ncontempt of court. Although he is aware that it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle without \na driver\u2019s license, Applicant admitted that he takes the risk and has continued to drive \nunlawfully since his 2014 arrest. Based on the actions described above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and \n31(b) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense;  \nand  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s continuing unwillingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations is troubling, for he routinely ignores the law when \nhe consistently drives a vehicle without a license, when it has been suspended or \nrevoked, without insurance, or with an expired or switched tag. Under these \ncircumstances, there is little, if any, evidence of rehabilitation. While a person should not \nbe held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, in this instance, the criminal \nconduct is routinely continuing. Given his cavalier attitude towards laws, rules, and \nregulations, Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, under the circumstances, continues \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is adopted herein. In addition, \nApplicant failed to self-report his 2014 arrest to his security manager or his facility security \noffice. Applicant\u2019s continuing unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations is \ntroubling. With respect to the incidents of criminal-personal conduct discussed above, and \nApplicant\u2019s failure to report his 2014 arrest, AG \u00b6 16(c) has been established. As to the \nalleged conduct, denied by Applicant, regarding his failure to comply with the corporate \nguidelines for professional conduct in December 2015, while further commentary appears \nbelow, AG \u00b6 16(c) has been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(e) The information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s continuing unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations, especially related to the unlawful driving issues, as well as his failures to pay \nthe court-assessed fines and costs, AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. While Applicant failed to \nself-report his 2014 arrest, he claimed that he was unaware that the incident was \nsupposed to be reported. There is no evidence that Applicant had been informed of his \nresponsibility to report it.  \n \nWith respect to the alleged incident of Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with the \ncorporate guidelines for professional conduct, guidelines which were not entered into \nevidence, in December 2015, as noted above, Applicant denied the allegation and the \nfacts underlying it. The only evidence of the alleged incident or the facts reported, are \nfound in a Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) Person Summary, called an \nIncident History, written by an unidentified individual, with no indicia of accuracy or \nverification. It does not appear to be an investigative report, and is unverified hearsay. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s denial of the allegation in its entirety, acceptable evidence of the alleged \nincident, at least in the form of an official corporate incident report, report of inquiry, or \nsome other verified document signed by a corporate executive or government official \nshould have been submitted. In the absence of such evidence, as to this allegation, AG \n\u00b6 17(e) applies. Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n \nThe SOR, as amended, identified 21 delinquent accounts, including unpaid court \nfines and fees, that had been placed for collection, charged off, or filed as judgments, \ntotaling approximately $48,677. There is no evidence that he was unwilling to satisfy his \ndebts or that he had the ability to do so, but with the purchase of one or more ATVs for \nhis children, each costing $5,000 to $6,000, there is evidence of frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, or consistent spending beyond his means, especially when he had numerous \ndelinquent accounts and unpaid court fines and fees. There has been no change in the \nstatus of a vast majority of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(e) \nhave been established, but AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;31 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;32 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nNone of the mitigation conditions apply. The conditions that supposedly resulted in \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were of his own making, not the result of conditions that \nwere largely beyond his control. The somewhat rare instances of his paying court fines \nand fees do not constitute a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to resolve his debts, and neither does the \nresolution of judgments by garnishment. Applicant claimed he hired a debt relief \norganization to resolve his debts. But, as noted above, he failed to submit documentation \n                                                          \n31 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n32 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nto support his claims. Although the record remained open, he also failed to furnish a \nrequested updated status of his SOR-related accounts supported by receipts, checks, or \nletters related to those debts; and a copy of his repayment plan showing any priority for \naddressing his delinquent accounts.  \nApplicant offered no documentation to indicate that he sought information from his \ncreditors or collection agents,33 or by obtaining financial counseling and credit resolution \nguidance and assistance. He offered evidence to indicate that his annual income is \nsufficient to address at least some of his delinquent accounts, but little evidence to \nindicate that his financial situation is now under control. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.34 \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant\u2019s promises have not \ntransitioned into positive action. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n                                                          \n33 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. \n \n34 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.35 \n \n There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a \n38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a missile \nassembler with his current employer since October 2004. He was granted a secret \nclearance in 2004. \n \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is an individual with a history of criminal conduct and personal conduct incidents \ntaking place starting in 2006 and continuing through 2014. In fact, although he has not \nbeen caught by the police authorities since 2014, Applicant continues to show an \nunwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, for he routinely ignores the law \nwhen he consistently drives a vehicle without a license, when it has been suspended or \nrevoked, without insurance, or with an expired or switched tag. Although he has been \nconvicted of numerous traffic-related violations and fined and assessed court fees, he \nhas generally ignored those fines and fees to the extent that he has twice been charged \nwith contempt of court. Judgments have been satisfied only through garnishments of his \nwages, not by mutually-agreed repayment plans. Although Applicant claimed to have \ntaken certain positive actions to address his creditors and delinquent accounts, he failed \nto submit requested documentation to support his various claims and contentions.  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:36 \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \n                                                          \n35 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n36 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a poor track record of debt reduction and elimination \nefforts, essentially failing to address nearly all of his SOR-related debts. Overall, the \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct, personal conduct, and \nfinancial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f. and 1.g.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a. and 3.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.c. through 3.m.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.n. through 3.v.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Statement of Reason (SOR) \nalleges Applicant provided false answers on forms applying for a security clearance. The \nissue is whether his 2011 termination, his two responses on a 2014 Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), and his single response on a 2003 \nSecurity Clearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86 raise concerns about his fitness \nto hold a security clearance. He has mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 5, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline E, personal conduct, and explaining why it was unable to find it clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for \nhim.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nThe DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn October 24, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On November 26, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on December 12, 2018.  \n \nEleven Government exhibits (Ex. 1-11) and two Applicant exhibits (Ex. A and B) \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. Documents submitted by Applicant as \nattachments to his SOR answer were also considered. Applicant testified, as reflected in \na transcript (Tr.) received on January 2, 2019. I held the record open after the hearing for \nApplicant to submit additional documents. On January 23, 2019, Applicant submitted a \nNovember 2017 e-QIP that was admitted without objection as Ex. C. \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted he left employment with a company \nover educational requirements and admitted he incorrectly answered questions on his e-\nQIP, but denied he intentionally falsified his answers. He indicated his failures to disclose \ninformation was due to misunderstandings and a false impression of his circumstances. \nAt the hearing, he admitted he completed the e-QIP faster that he should have. (Tr. 80) \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior engineer who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince November 2017. (Ex. 2) From June 1991 to June 1997, he honorably served in the \nU.S. Army working on aircraft electrical and armament systems. (Tr. 23) While in the \nArmy, he attended a six-month electronic aviation course. (Tr. 34) He married in \nNovember 2017 and has no children. (Tr. 24)  \nApplicant testified that in 1991, at age 18, five months after joining the Army, he \nattended a party, met, and spent the night with a female Marine. The next day, he was \ninformed he was being charged with rape. Applicant later learned the woman was not \nfully aware of the seriousness of the charges and decided to drop the charges. (Tr. 57) \nAlthough charged by civil authorities with rape, the charges were nolle prosequied. \nNo disciplinary action was taken by the civilian or military authorities after the allegations \nwere dropped. (Tr. 25) Applicant appeared in court with his drill sergeant. The district \nattorney said the charges had been dropped and there was nothing to prosecute. \nApplicant\u2019s court appearance lasted five minutes. He was not asked any questions during \nthe court proceeding nor was he informed the charge was a felony. (Tr. 27) \nWhen Applicant completed his August 2004 SF 86, he answered \u201cno\u201d when asked \nif he had ever been charged with or convicted of a felony offense. (Ex. 1) He answered \n\n \n3 \nas he did because, \u201cI assumed that . . . somebody made a false allegation and it went to \ncourt and nothing happened.\u201d (Ex. 3, Tr. 40) He now understands that similar questions \non security forms requires an affirmative answer. (Tr. 41) He admits he went through the \nquestionnaire faster than he should have due in part to his work load. (Tr. 44, Tr. 80) \nWhen he completed his November 2017 e-QIP, he indicated he was \u201caccused of rape, \nbut charges were dropped by accuser and the state said there was no evidence to file \ncharges or continue the case.\u201d` (Ex. C) \nApplicant had two Enhanced Subject Interviews. One in December 2014 focused \non his 1991 arrest and the other, in June 2016, focused on his 2011 termination. In his \n2014 interview, Applicant explained that he had been charged with rape in 1991, was \ntaken to the police station, and then released. (Ex. 3) He said he went to court with this \ndrill sergeant. The charges were dropped and no further action was taken. (Ex. 3) He said \nhe did not list the incident because the charges were dropped and he was told there would \nbe no record of the incident because the charges were dropped. (Ex. 3)  \nApplicant asserted the first chance he had to correct the information was during \nhis December 2014 interview. (Tr. 80) During the interview, he corrected and thoroughly \nexplained his actions. At the hearing, he asserted it was never his intent to deceive the \nGovernment, and he has done what he could to remedy the mistake (Tr. 80)  \nAfter leaving the military, Applicant was working at an aircraft company when fellow \ntechnicians told him that military courses would be accepted for college credits at a \nuniversity. In 1996, he enrolled at the university. (Tr. 30) In February 2002, he graduated \nfrom the university after completing a series of correspondence courses over a six-year \nperiod. (Ex. 7, Tr. 29, 30) The correspondence course were received in the mail and \ncompleted. This was prior to correspondence courses being routinely done through the \ninternet. (Tr. 72) The correspondence courses he took with the university were similar in \nnature to the correspondence courses he took while he was in the military. (Ex. 7, Tr. 31) \nSome of the 24 courses listed on his university transcript were courses taken while he \nwas on active duty. He was unaware of any accreditation problem with the university until \ninformed by his employer. (Tr. 37)  \nIn 2006, Applicant started working at company X. (Tr. 41) While working at the \ncompany, the company had enough confidence in him to promote him to a management \nposition. (Tr. 68) In July 2011, after being employed for six years, he was terminated by \nhis employer. The company\u2019s stated reason for termination was he had stated he had an \nElectrical Engineering (Bachelors) Degree from \u201cX\u2019 University on his employment \napplication. (Ex. 8) The company had learned the university was not licensed or \naccredited. He was unaware of any accreditation problems with the university until \ninformed by his employer. (Tr. 37)  \nThe company stated: \n \nIt has come to our attention that you do not have a Bachelor\u2019s Degree from \na licensed and authorized educational institution. You indicated on your \nemployment application that you had an Electrical Engineering degree from \n\n \n4 \n[X] University that was acquired after completing 4 years of study. [X] \nUniversity is neither licensed nor accredited. A BS in Engineering is a \nrequirement for the Engineer V position that you were hired into at \n[company]. Because you do not meet the requirements of your positon, your \nemployment with [company] Corporation is terminated effective today, July \n27, 2011. (Ex. 9)  \nOn his October 2014 e-QIP, Applicant listed the reason for leaving as \u201ccontract \nended\u201d and did not list he had been terminated. (Ex. 2, Tr. 47) In July 2011, the contract \nhe was working on was coming to an end. He believes the reason given by the company, \ni.e. his educational degree, was simply an excuse and not the real reason for his \ntermination. While working on a government contract he told his company he did not need \nthree employees to work full time on the contract. Company management then told him \nhe was not a \u201ccompany man\u201d and it was time for him to leave the company. (Tr. 48, 68) \nHe gave up his management position with the company when his support of the \ngovernment conflicted with the company\u2019s views. (Tr. 48) The company eventually lost \nthe contract he was working on. (Tr. 68)  \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2016 enhanced subject interview, he explained his 2011 \ntermination. He admitted he had been \u201clet go\u201d from his former employer. He told the \ninvestigator that the company terminated him because his degree was not from an \naccredited school. (Ex. 4) On his November 2017 e-QIP, he listed he had been terminated \nfrom X company. (Ex. C, Tr. 49) He indicated he had been fired in 2011 and stated the \nreason as \u201cdiscrepancy with my degree. I filled out a \u2018request for transcript\u2019 for as part of \nmy hiring packet. It wasn\u2019t until almost six years later I was notified there was a problems \nwith my degree.\u201d (Ex. C)  \nWhen Applicant was told by the company that the university he attended was not \nan accredited university, he conducted an on-line computer search of the university and \nreceived conflicting information. (Ex. 4) So he did not know what to believe. Because of \nhis confusion, he listed the university on his application for his next job. The job lasted \nuntil October 2014, at which time he began employment with his current employer. (Ex. \n2). While employed at his next job, a member of management told him his degree was \nnot considered valid; however, the employer would substituted his years of experience \nfor any educational requirement. (Ex. 4) He did not list the university on his 2014 e-QIP \nor on his 2017 e-QIP. (Ex. 2, Ex. 4, Ex. C, Tr. 49) \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s 2011 termination, he received unemployment compensation. \n(Tr. 46) He testified that he believed if the termination had been justified he would not \nhave been eligible to receive unemployment benefits. (Tr. 46) However, his former \nemployer did challenged his receiving unemployment compensation. Applicant had \nmoved to another state, and the out-of-state unemployment office sent notices of hearings \nto his previous address. (Ex. 3) He received the notices after the hearing dates had \npassed. After two or three unsuccessfully attempted to reschedule the hearings, he \nreached a repayment agreement to repay benefits received. (Ex. 3, Tr. 74)  \n\n \n5 \nIn 2014, Applicant started a master\u2019s program with [State] Institute of Technology \nand completed his first class. (Tr. 72) However he did not have time to continue the \nprogram. He believes that if there was a problem with his X University\u2019s degree it would \nhave been brought to his attention when he enrolled in the master\u2019s program, as \ncompletion of a bachelor\u2019s degree is a prerequisite to enrollment in a master\u2019s degree. \n(Tr. 72) \nIn December 2016, Applicant started a job with a different company. (Ex. A) The \ncompany stopped the process for his security clearance. He was informed the processing \n\u201cwas stopped on this case due to the fact you are not in a position that requires a security \nclearance.\u201d (Tr. 2) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n \n6 \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe concerns about personal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 15 of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG):  \n  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \ndocument or oral statement to the Government, when applying for a security clearance, \nis a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification \nmust be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. \nApplicant denies that he intentionally lied to deceive the Government. He said he made \na mistake by going through the application faster than he should have and based on faulty \nreasoning.  \n \nA judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there \nis direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at \nthe time the omission occurred. If determined to be a deliberate omission, concealment, \n\n \n7 \nor falsification, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant to present evidence to \nexplain the omission. \n \n \nApplicant failed to list his 1991 arrest on his 2003 SF 86 and failed to list his 1991 \narrest and 2011 termination when he completed his 2014 e-QIP. In 1991, he went to a \nparty and spent the night with a female Marine. The next day he was charged with rape. \nHe provided a plausible explanation to avert the reasonable inference that he falsified his \nSF 86 by not listing this arrest. He answered as he did because, first, he did not know the \ncharge was a felony and second, he assumed that other individual had made a false \nallegation. When he went to court, the charges were dropped by the accuser, and the \nstate attorney said there was no evidence to file charges or continue the case. He \nassumed the matter was finished. He now understands that similar questions on security \nforms requires an affirmative answer, and he has answered affirmatively on a subsequent \ne-QIP.  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is not established when omissions are due to misunderstanding, \ninadvertent mistake, or other cause that could negate the willful intent. Applicant did not \nlist his 2011 termination, because he believes the company was using his lack of \neducation as an excuse to fire someone who was not a \u201ccompany man\u201d when he refused \nto add unnecessary personnel to a government contract. He was with the company \nalmost six years before the educational problem arose. On his employment application \nhe listed the university he attended. He had a duty to list his education on the application. \nHe was not required to vouch for the accreditation of the university. \n \n \n AG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \n During his 2014 interview, Applicant volunteered details of his 1991 arrest and \ncorrected his previous mistake by listing it when he completed his 2017 e-QIP. In his 2016 \ninterview he explained his 2011 termination. In his 2017 e-QIP and interviews, he fully \nexplained both issues. The December 2014 subject interview states he volunteered the \ninformation about his arrest. He made good-faith efforts to correct the mistakes on his \nOctober 2014 e-QIP concerning his 1991 arrest. It was during his 2016 interview, when \n\n \n8 \nhe discussed his 2011 termination. He asserts these interviews were his first opportunity \nhe had to correct the omissions on his 2003 SF 86 and 2014 e-QIP. As previously stated, \nApplicant did not list the 1991 arrest because he did not think it was a felony and because \nhe believes a false allegation had been made against him.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) provides mitigation where \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The conduct is infrequent and it has been \nmore than 17 years since his arrest and four years since his termination. His arrest was \nin 1991, his termination was in 2011, he executed his SF 86 in 2003, and executed the \ne-QIP in question in 2014. The conduct in limited to a single question on his 2003 SF 86 \nand two questions on the 2014 e-QIP, which makes the conduct infrequent. He has fully \ndisclosed and explained what happened regarding each incident. The mitigating \nconditions in AG \u00b6 17(c) applies.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant has not received counseling, he has fully explained his 1991 \narrest and his 2011 termination, and has listed each on his 2017 e-QIP. Thus, his conduct \nis unlikely to recur. The mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17(d) applies. Having observed \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and listened to his testimony, I find his answer on his 2003 SF 86 \nand his answers on his 2014 e-QIP were not deliberate omissions, concealments, or \nfalsifications.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. My comments under Guideline E are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n9 \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior engineer who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince November 2017. (Ex. 2) From June 1991 to June 1997, he honorably served in the \nU.S. Army. His military service merits considerable respect.  \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. When Applicant completed his job application, he listed \nthe university he attended. Almost six years later, he was terminated because the \nuniversity was not accredited. He has no duty to vouch for the university\u2019s accreditation. \nHe did not list the 1991 arrest because he did not know it was a felony and believed the \nmatter dropped when the case was nolle prosequied. He assumed he was the victim of \nfalse allegations and the matter was over. He has explained each incident on his most \nrecent e-QIP and in his interviews. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nDOD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. The issue is whether his single response on a 2003 SF 86, his 2011 \ntermination, and his two responses on a 2014 e-QIP raises concerns about his fitness to \nhold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.d:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He is a 37-year-old enterprise director engineer employed by a U.S. defense contractor since August 2017. He served honorably in the U.S. military from June 2000 to July 2009, 3 and in a reserve component from August 2009 to March 2011. He had a favorable background investigation, with clearance issued, in September 2009 (GE 2), and a favorable reinvestigation in early 2011 (GE 1). This investigation appears to be due to a break in service requiring reinvestigation. In July 1999, and again in November 2010, Applicant was arrested for soliciting prostitution in undercover operations. He was found guilty of disturbing the peace, and given minimal sentences involving fines, school attendance, and community service, all of which he successfully completed. His attorneys told him that the charges would eventually be dismissed. Applicant attributed these arrests to his experiencing particularly stressful times in his life. In July 1999, he was avoiding going home to an abusive relationship with his father (Tr. 22). In November 2010, he was going through a contentious separation\u2014and ultimately divorce\u2014with his wife, as well as trying to get ready to go to college (Tr. 23).

Corrales, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Gregory F. Greiner, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 5 December 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline D, Sexual\nBehavior, Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline\nF, Financial Considerations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing\n2\nbefore the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case\nConsisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-7, and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-K. AE K was\n1\ntimely received post hearing. AE J was admitted for the sole purpose of identifying AE A-I for the record (Tr.\n15-16).\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. However, on 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8\nJune 2017. My decision is the same under both guidelines.\n1\n02/06/2019\n\nto me 26 September 2017, and I convened a hearing 15 December 2017. DOHA\nreceived the transcript 2 January 2018, and the record closed.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except SOR 3.a and paragraph 4. He is\na 37-year-old enterprise director engineer employed by a U.S. defense contractor since\nAugust 2017.  He served honorably in the U.S. military from June 2000 to July 2009,\n3\nand in a reserve component from August 2009 to March 2011. He had a favorable\nbackground investigation, with clearance issued, in September 2009 (GE 2), and a\nfavorable reinvestigation in early 2011 (GE 1). This investigation appears to be due to a\nbreak in service requiring reinvestigation.\nIn July 1999, and again in November 2010, Applicant was arrested for soliciting\nprostitution in undercover operations. He was found guilty of disturbing the peace, and\ngiven minimal sentences involving fines, school attendance, and community service, all\nof which he successfully completed. His attorneys told him that the charges would\neventually be dismissed. Applicant attributed these arrests to his experiencing\nparticularly stressful times in his life. In July 1999, he was avoiding going home to an\nabusive relationship with his father (Tr. 22). In November 2010, he was going through a\ncontentious separation\u2014and ultimately divorce\u2014with his wife, as well as trying to get\nready to go to college (Tr. 23).\nApplicant did not disclose the November 2010 arrest on either his January 2011\n(GE 2) or November 2013 (GE 1) clearance applications. He also failed to disclose six\ndelinquent debts on his November 2013 clearance application. He admits the\nomissions, but denies any intent to mislead the Government. In each instance, he was\nbeing pressed by his employer to complete the applications quickly because of\noperational requirements overseas (Tr. 29).\nThe SOR also alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, but Applicant denies\nten delinquent debts totaling over $24,000. Record evidence shows that SOR 1.j is a\nduplicate of SOR 1.a,  so there are nine debts totaling nearly $21,000 at issue The\n4\ndebts comprise a delinquent utility bill (SOR 1.d), two delinquent medical bills (SOR 1.f,\n1.g), and six delinquent education loans (SOR 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.h-1.I) .\nApplicant offered a number of exhibits to demonstrate that all the SOR-alleged\ndebts had been satisfied, some more efficacious than others. AE F shows that SOR\nThis is a different contractor than originally sponsored his November 2013 clearance application.\n3\nThe account number for SOR 1.j listed in GE 7 matches the account number for SOR 1.a listed in GE 6 in\n4\npertinent part, sufficient to conclude the accounts are the same.\n2\n\ndebt 1.d was paid in full in March 2017.  AE G and H show that SOR debts 1.f and 1.g,\n5\nrespectively, were canceled and returned to the creditor with zero balances in\nNovember 2017.  Although these three debts were not addressed until after Applicant\n6\nreceived the SOR, the amounts involved are minimal, and the security concerns raised\nde minimus \n \nHowever, the remaining education loans are not so easily resolved. AE\nD\u2014March 2017 correspondence from the collection agent for the SOR 4.a creditor on\nbehalf of one of the colleges Applicant attended\u2014reflects that a $4,631.22 balance was\nsettled for an unspecified amount. However, none of the account numbers or other\nidentifying numbers listed in the correspondence match the account numbers listed in\nGE 6 or 7, although the delinquent amounts in GE 6 and AE D are similar. Similarly, AE\nE reflects that two defaulted loans held by the SOR 4.b and 4.c creditor were paid in\nMarch 2017, but contains no identifying numbers (account numbers or balances paid) to\nmatch AE E to the 4.b and 4.c numbers listed in GE 6. Applicant asserts (Tr. 36) that AE\nC shows that the education loans at SOR 1.h and 1.I have also been paid as of March\n2017. But again, neither account numbers or balances appear to confirm that claim.\nFederally guaranteed student loans are difficult to track through credit reports\nbecause of the way the loans are issued, defaulted, consolidated, and rehabilitated, \nseldom with the same account numbers attached to the accounts. Education programs\nchange names, further complicating deciphering the process. Ultimately, all the loans\nare guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). However, there are direct\nstudent loans (made by the DOE) and indirect student loans (made by private lenders\nthrough DOE programs). A given loan may have multiple parties involved in its\nmanagement, any or all of whom may report its status to the credit bureaus. Thus, for\nexample, Applicant\u2019s January 2014 credit report contains multiple entries from the\nlender at SOR 1.e (and its education loan arm) in current status because the loans\nchronicled were in deferred status at the time and transferred to another holder. It also\nshows an account moving into late payment status, and being transferred to the DOE,\nwhere it was ultimately paid. A further example, AE C, is a compendium of documents\npurporting to show Applicant\u2019s loan settlement with DOE. Nevertheless, the connection\nis difficult to make.  The documents show, without account numbers, six loans\n7\nSOR debt 1.d\u2014a utility bill incurred when a final bill was not forwarded after Applicant moved from a\n5\nresidence and closed the account\u2014appears on Applicant\u2019s January 2014 credit report (GE 7) and was first\nreported delinquent in March 2013. The reported account numbers on GE 7 and AE F match.\nAgain, the debts originally appear in GE 7, and the account numbers in GE 7 match the account numbers\n6\nin AE G and H.\nThe first page of the exhibit is the first page of a 3 March 2017 letter from the DOE, regarding an account\n7\nnumber that appears nowhere else in the record, whereby DOE accepts a $9,250 payment as settlement in\nfull of \u201cdefaulted student loan(s) and/or grant overpayment(s).\u201d The next two pages are a 22 July 2014 letter\nfrom the then collection agent for DOE, referencing the same account number, offering to settle Applicant\u2019s\ndefaulted loans for that amount. The fourth page is a screen shot of an otherwise-unidentified \u201cFederal Student\nAid\u201d web page, which reflects six disbursed loans totaling $18,239 and six disbursed grants totaling $17,097,\nas of 19 December 2016. The next 11 pages consist of a National Student Loan Data System printout with\n3\n\nguaranteed by DOE, two direct,  four indirect. The four indirect loans were all to the\n8\neducational institution in AE A (which shows all school charges paid). All four indirect\nloans were made by the same bank alleged as one of the creditors on SOR debt 1.e,\nand guaranteed by the same \u201cGuaranty Agency\u201d as the creditor on SOR debts 1.b and\n1.c. The first two indirect loans totaled $4,168, were serviced by the other creditor on\nSOR debt 1.e, and were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 1 March 2017.  The\n9\nlast two indirect loans totaled $5,334, but serviced by a creditor not alleged on the SOR,\nand were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 1 and 2 May 2014 [AE C, K(1)].\nApplicant\u2019s January 2014 credit report (GE 7) shows SOR debts 4.e-4.j, as\nalleged, encompassing the education loans, with complete account numbers, at SOR\n4.e and 4.h-4,j, with 4.j being a duplicate of SOR 4.a, which appears on Applicant\u2019s\nSeptember 2016 credit report (GE 6), with account number as alleged, along with\neducation loans 4.b and 4.c (account numbers as alleged), as well as SOR debt 4.d.\nSOR debt 4.e also appears on GE 6 (with an account number matching GE 7) with the\nsame lender as alleged in the SOR, but a different servicing agent.\nApplicant attributed his education loan problems to his not understanding the\ninterplay between the school payments being made through the military tuition\nassistance program, his grants, and his education loans. He stated that he did not\nunderstand that the military tuition assistance did not cover all his education expenses\n(Tr. 31-33). However, he acknowledges getting dunning letters from the creditors at\nSOR 1.a-1.c and 1.h-1.I beginning in 2011 (Tr. 31, 36, 51-52). He thought the creditors\ndid not adequately explain where his military tuition assistance payments went. His\ncredit reports (GE 6, 7) show that he disputed these education loans with the credit\nbureaus, but no changes were made. Further, he produced little in the way of\ndocumentation showing his efforts to resolve the loans before he received the SOR.\nNevertheless, when he received the SOR, he renewed his efforts to resolve his\neducation loans (Tr. 35, 53-54).\nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a\nbudget. He stated he had $8,181 positive bi-monthly cash flow (Tr. 58). His work and\ncharacter references (GE I, Answer) consider him honest and trustworthy and\nrecommend him for his clearance. However, none of them states any knowledge of the\nSOR issues.\nthe detailed, but not necessarily decipherable, status of Applicant\u2019s loans and grants. The grants are not at\nissue in the SOR, so I have given no consideration to those entries.\nThe two direct loans total $8,737, were being serviced directly by the DOE Debt Management and Collections\n8\nSystem (not the creditor alleged at SOR 4.a), and were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 23 July\n2014. The two direct loans were for the educational institution in AE B, which shows that all Applicant\u2019s\ncharges at the school have been paid.\nAE K(2) shows that on 15 November 2015 the loan balances totaled $5,706.14. \n9\n4\n\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\nGovernment.10\nAnalysis\n          \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guidelines D and J\nby demonstrating Applicant\u2019s two arrests for soliciting prostitution.  However, Applicant\n11\nmitigated the security concerns by demonstrating that the charges had been\nsignificantly reduced, the arrests were infrequent and occurred under particularly\nstressful circumstances, and the most recent arrest had occurred over seven years\nago.12\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n10\n\u00b613(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted; \u00b631(b)\n11\nevidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or\nconvicted;\n\u00b614(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances,\n12\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\njudgment; \u00b632(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\n5\n\nThe Government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E.\nCross-referencing the sexual behavior under Guideline E (SOR 3.a) adds no security\nconcerns that are not otherwise covered under the guidelines for sexual behavior and\ncriminal conduct. Moreover, I found credible Applicant\u2019s testimony that he rushed\nthrough his clearance applications, and thus lacked intent to falsify his applications or\nmislead the Government.\nHowever, the Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline\nF, and Applicant failed to fully mitigate the security concerns. Applicant accumulated\nsignificant delinquent debt, as Federally-guaranteed education loans, and largely\nignored these obligations until after he received the SOR.13\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations.\nThe conduct was recent, frequent, and the circumstances were not unusual.  Beginning\n14\nin 2011, Applicant was aware that his understanding of what his military tuition\nassistance covered was incorrect. After this point, the circumstances of his financial\nproblems were certainly within his control, and he was irresponsible in addressing his\ndebts until after he received the SOR.  He did not document his claimed efforts to deal\n15\nwith his lenders after becoming aware of his defaulted education loans\n \nApplicant has neither claimed nor documented any credit or financial counseling.\nAssuming the best-case scenario, Applicant has apparently made a number of\npayments to resolve education loans that may or may not correspond to the education\nloans alleged in the SOR.  However, even if I concluded that the payments received\n16\ncover the accounts alleged, the fact remains that these were not undertaken until after\nhe received the SOR. This precludes a conclusion that Applicant has made a good-faith\neffort to address his debts.  The Government is not the collection agent of last resort.\n17\nApplicants are expected to meet their financial obligations for moral reasons and legal\nrequirements. Applicant\u2019s belated efforts to address his education loans may have\nreached the point where he may be considered to have resolved them, he cannot\nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s relliability,\ntrustworthiness or good judgment;\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a\n13\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n14\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n15\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . .  and there are clear indications\n16\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n17\nresolve debts.\n6\n\nescape the security concerns raised by the fact that he did not resolve them until after\nhe received the SOR. Moreover, his work and character references were unaware of his\nfinancial problems, undercutting their ability to support a whole-person assessment to\novercome the security concerns raised by his conduct.

At one time, after being \nunemployed for six months, he was past due on four student loans, past due on a home \nequity line of credit, and owed approximately $15,500 for two medical debts. The line of \ncredit against his home equity was paid when his house sold. He is current on the \nconsolidation of his student loans. He has made sufficient progress toward resolving his \npast-due debts and delinquent obligations to continue his security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 4, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and explaining why it was \n02/13/2019\n\n \n2 \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him.1  \n \nOn January 9, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On February 7, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on February 26, 2018.  \n \nFive Government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and two Applicant\u2019s exhibits (Ex. A and B) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Records submitted by Applicant as attachments \nto his answer were considered. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on March 6, 2018. I held the record open after the hearing for Applicant to submit \nadditional documents, which were received and admitted into the record as Ex. C \u2013 C-3. \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective \u201cfor \nall covered individuals\u201d on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility under the new AGs.2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the delinquent obligations (SOR 1.a \n-1.f), specifically admitting a $15,149 (SOR 1.a) medical debt, which he had been told \nwas covered by his health insurance, but later he learned the majority of the cost was not \ncovered by his insurance. (Tr. 21) He admitted he owed four student loans (SOR 1.c -1.f) \nthat were for his daughter\u2019s college education. The loans totaling approximately $35,500 \nwere $2,572 past due. He denied being more than 120 days delinquent on a $32,478 \n(SOR 1.g) home equity loan, which he asserted had been paid when he sold his home in \nJune 2016. After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 The DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, \n2006. \n \n2 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in \nthis case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf. \n  \n\n \n3 \nApplicant is a 64-year-old aircraft technical design engineer who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since July 2015. (Ex. 2) He seeks a favorable security clearance \ndetermination. (Ex 2) He is married and has a 31-year-old son, a 32-year-old daughter3, \nand a 36-year-old stepdaughter. (Ex. 2) His annual income, with overtime, is \napproximately $110,000. (Tr. 44) His wife is not employed.  \n \nFrom November 2004 until January 2015, Applicant had worked as a contractor \nfor an aircraft manufacturing company. From January 2015 through July 2015, he was \nunemployed due to company downsizing. (Tr. 43) In July 2015, he obtained a contractor\u2019s \nposition with the same aircraft manufacturing company, but the position required him to \nmove to a new state. (Ex. 2) As a result of the move, he sold his house and had to pay \nthe cost of the 2,000 mile move. (SOR Response, Tr. 12).  \n \nIn 2015, Applicant missed two or three mortgage payments on his loan for his \nprevious residence and worked with the Making Home Affordable Program. (Ex. 3) For \napproximately a year, from July 2015 through June 2016, he was paying his $800 \nmortgage at his old location and paying for a hotel at his new location, which left no extra \nmoney. (Ex. 3, Tr. 35) The SOR lists $1,869 as being 120 days past due on a $32,478 \nhome equity line of credit. (SOR 1.g) In June 2016, he sold his home. (Ex. 3) All \noutstanding debts were paid at the time of sale, including the mortgage and equity line of \ncredit. (Tr. 28, SOR Response) He received $87,858 at the time of sale representing his \nequity in the home. (SOR Response)  \n \nThree months after he sold his previous home, Applicant purchased a new home \nat his new location. (Tr. 30) The home he purchased has been paid for in full. (Tr. 39) He \nasserted he has $25,000 in savings and $5,000 in his checking account. (Tr. 40) His \nvehicles are paid for and he has no loan payments apart from his payment on his \nconsolidated student loan. (Tr. 40) His only large monthly expenditure is $1,600 for health \ninsurance. (Tr. 48)  \n \nIn 2015, when Applicant was unemployed, he was unable to make student loan \npayments. The student loans were for his daughter\u2019s college education and had been \nobtained between November 2005 and October 2008. (Ex. 4) The loans totaling \napproximately $35,500 were $2,572 past due. In June 2017, he contacted the federal \nloan servicing company which serviced the student loans in order to consolidate the four \nloans. (Ex. C-3) The servicing company\u2019s February 2018 letter indicates he owed $39,203 \non the student loans with monthly payments of $270. (Ex. C-1) At that time, he was zero \ndays delinquent on the loan and had unpaid interest of $57. (Ex. B) The student loan \npayment is automatically debited from his bank account. (Tr. 47) He asserts he has made \nhis monthly payments in a timely manner since March 2017. (Tr. 37)  \n \nDuring his June 2016 enhanced subject interview, he stated his intention was to \nfirst buy a house and then establish a payment plan to resolve the student loan obligation. \n(Ex. 3) At that time, he believed he could pay off all of the student loans in three to five \nyears. (Ex. 3)  \n                                                          \n3 At the hearing, Applicant stated his daughter was 24 year old and was living with him. (Tr. 23)  \n\n \n4 \n \nIn March 2017, Applicant agreed to pay a financial repair company approximately \n$600 over six months to assist him in restoring his credit profile and maximizing his credit \nscore. (Ex. C-2, Tr. 46) He had one financial counseling session with the company. (Tr. \n38) He had incurred a $15,489 medical collection debt (SOR 1.a) when he had a stent \ninserted in the blood vessel going to his liver. (Tr. 44) He had medical insurance, and \nprior to the procedure had been told the medical procedure would be covered by his \ninsurance. (Tr. 24) After the procedure, he learned most of the cost was not covered by \nhis insurance. The medical debt no longer appears on his credit report. (Tr. 24, Ex. 6)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s November 2015 credit report lists the four past-due student loans, a \npast-due home equity line of credit, a past-due mortgage, and the medical collection debt \n(SOR 1.a $15,489). (Ex. 4) It also list 18 accounts as being \u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d His August \n2016 credit report lists a zero balance on his home equity line of credit and mortgage \nloan. (Ex. 4) The credit report lists the medical collection account, but does not list any \namount as past due on the debt. (Ex. 5) His February 2018 credit report lists no collection \naccounts or any past-due amounts. (Ex. 6) The medical debt no longer appears as a debt \non his February 2018 credit report. (Ex. 6) He asserted he paid the $115 medical debt \n(SOR 1.b). (Tr. 27) The debt does not appear on either of his most recent credit reports. \n(Ex. 5, Ex. 6) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n5 \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed-upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \nThe SOR lists two medical collection accounts, $2,572 as past due on four student \nloans, and $1,869 past due on a home equity line of credit. AG \u00b6 19 includes two qualifying \n\n \n6 \nconditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) \ninability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never \nshifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)). \n \n \nFour of the seven Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant was $1,869 past due on a $32,478 home equity line of credit. In June \n2016, the debt was paid when his house sold. At that time, he received almost $88,000 \nin equity from the home sale. He purchased a new house that is paid in full as are his \nvehicles.  \n \nIn 2015, Applicant was out of work for six months when his company downsized. \nHe incurred moving expenses when he obtained a new job 2,000 miles away. For a year, \nuntil his house sold, he had to make his mortgage payments as well as paying for a motel \nstay. When he was unemployed, four student loans went past due. In May 2017, he \nconsolidated the four loans and entered into an agreement whereby the monthly loan \npayment on the consolidated loans would be automatically deducted from his account. \nAs of February 2018, there was no delinquency on the student loan debt. He asserts he \npaid the $115 medical debt. Neither that medical debt, nor the larger medical debt appear \non his most current credit report. His annual salary is $110,000, and he has $30,000 in \nhis saving and checking accounts.  \n \n\n \n7 \nApplicant\u2019s November 2015 credit reports, listed the past due accounts and the \ntwo medical collection accounts, but also listed 18 accounts as being paid as agreed. \nThat November 2015 credit report followed his six months of unemployment from January \nthrough July 2015.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was compromised by his six \nmonths of unemployment and having to make his mortgage payments at his previous \nlocation while also paying for a motel stay at his new location. Loss of employment is a \nfactor beyond his control as is having to relocate 2,000 miles for a new job. Additionally, \nhe had a medical procedure to have a stent inserted into a blood vessel. Prior to the \nprocedure, he was told the cost would be covered by insurance. After the procedure, he \nlearned the majority of the cost was not covered by his insurance. Such a procedure is \nnot elective surgery. It may not have been a medical emergency, but it did result in a debt \nthat was largely beyond his control.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) apply. He received financial counseling, his home equity \nline of credit debt was paid, and he is current on the student loan payments. He initiated, \nand is adhering to, a good-faith effort to repay his past-due student loans. His income and \namounts on deposit in his checking and saving accounts, indicate he has sufficient \nincome and funds to resolve his debts, especially when he has no house or vehicle \npayments.  \n \n \nThe medical debts do not appear on Applicant\u2019s current credit report. He has \nsufficient income and savings to address the medical debt should that debt be pursued \nby the creditor. There is no indication the creditor is pursuing the debt.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \n\n \n8 \nsurrounding this case. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 64 years old, and he has been employed by a DoD contractor as an \naircraft engineer since July 2015. A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nThe largest of his obligations are the student loans. At one time the loans were past due, \nbut have now been consolidated and he is current on his payment on the debt. Incurring \nstudent loans is seen as an obligation incurred to improve his daughter\u2019s life, with respect \nto future employment and career prospects, and, as such, are viewed differently than a \ndebt obligation for a new car or credit card debt.  \n \nThere is no indication in the record as to the status of the larger of the two medical \ndebts. It is clear that the debt no longer appears on Applicant\u2019s credit report. There are \nnumerous reasons why a debt may no longer appear on a credit report. However, there \nis no indication the creditor is pursuing collection of the medical debt. Should the creditor \npursue collection, Applicant has sufficient income and savings to address the debt.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nDOD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. The issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been \npaid\u2014it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a \nsecurity clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: J. Anderson Mullins, Esq. \n08/26/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \nThe Government alleged security concerns under Guideline A (allegiance to the \nUnited States) and Guideline E (personal conduct) over Applicant\u2019s past membership in \na white supremacist organization, including as a high-ranking officer and director of the \norganization. Other Guideline E concerns relate to Applicant\u2019s prior criminal record and \nmarijuana use. The Government did not establish a security concern under Guideline A. \nHowever, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the Guideline E \nsecurity concerns. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in December 2014. \nOn September 28, 2018, following a background investigation, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline A (allegiance to the United \nStates) and Guideline E (personal conduct). The DOD CAF acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \n\n \n2 \n \n \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. Applicant answered the SOR on October 19, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \n \nThis case was assigned to me on January 9, 2019. On February 1, 2019, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling the hearing for February 20, 2019. The hearing took place as \nscheduled. Department Counsel submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, \nall of which were admitted but for GE 2, the unauthenticated summary of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground interview. (Tr. 18-19) GE 3 through GE 11 were admitted over Applicant\u2019s \nobjections. (Tr. 22-44) Applicant testified. He did not submit any proposed exhibits. The \nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received on March 4, 2019.  \n \nThe SOR allegations and the Government\u2019s supporting evidence \n \nWhile I admitted all but one of the Government\u2019s proposed exhibits, upon \nreflection, some of them warrant additional analysis concerning their weight. I address \nthem here, as appropriate, before turning to the Findings of Fact.  \n \nUnder Guideline A, the Government alleges that until at least January 2015, \nApplicant was a member and high-ranking officer of an organization that advocates \nsedition against the U.S. government, advocates the use of force and violence to \noverthrow and influence the U.S. government, and to prevent others from exercising \ntheir lawful, constitutional rights. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) This is also cross-alleged under Guideline \nE as a personal conduct concern. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant \nacknowledged that he had been a member of the organization, but denied the \ncharacterizations and aims of the group as alleged. He did not address whether he had \nbeen a \u201chigh-ranking officer\u201d of Group X. (Answer) The other Guideline E allegations \nconcern Applicant\u2019s prior marijuana use and criminal offenses. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \u2013 2.g) \n \n \nI will refer to the organization at issue as \u201cGroup X,\u201d and have chosen not to \nidentify the group by name, due to Privacy Act implications. In its case in chief, the \nGovernment submitted several documents either from Group X or about its beliefs, all \ndated between 1983 and 2018. (GE 7-11) (The record copies of these documents \nsubmitted at hearing are highlighted. Applicant\u2019s counsel had the opportunity to review \nthose highlights during the hearing. (Tr. 45-46))  \n \n \nGovernment Exhibit 10 is a reported federal appellate case, published in 1983. \nThe case holds that Group X was not entitled to federal tax-exempt status because: a) \ntheir materials did not fit a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term \u201ceducational;\u201d \nb) Group X \u201cfailed to present any reasoned development of its conclusions\u201d in its \npublications; and c) Group X \u201cwas not \u2018educational\u2019 because its principal function was \nthe mere presentation of unsupported opinion.\u201d (GE 10 at 1)  \n \nIn considering GE 10, I have taken notice of the court\u2019s central holding, about \nGroup X\u2019s tax status, but cannot consider any of the evidence that court had before it, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsince it is not in the record here. I also give GE 10 very little weight, given its age, and \nlack of specific connection to Applicant.  \n \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibit 11 is a 2014 probate case, in which a Canadian court \ninvalidated the testator\u2019s bequest of his estate to Group X on the grounds that the \nwritings and other communications of Group X are illegal under Canadian law and \ncontrary to Canadian public policy. (GE 11) As with GE 10, the evidence that was \nbefore the Canadian court is not in the record here (with limited exception noted below). \nAdditionally, Canadian case law has no precedential value, either in American \nadministrative law in general, or in DOHA jurisprudence in particular, and it would be \nerror to follow it here. Thus, the conclusions of the Canadian court in that case are \nirrelevant.  \n \nNevertheless, review of GE 11 reveals that certain paragraphs in the Canadian \ncourt opinion include block quotes from published materials from Group X that are in the \nrecord in this case. Specifically, paragraphs 15-18 and 20-23 of GE 11 are excerpted \nfrom a document entitled \u201cWhat is [Group X].\u201d That document is not in evidence here. \nHowever, the excerpts in those paragraphs in GE 11 appear identical to similar excerpts \nfrom Group X\u2019s website, printed in May 2018, which is in evidence here, as GE 9. \nSimilarly, paragraph 23 of GE 11 is excerpted from Group X\u2019s Bulletin of April/May \n1990, admitted in this case as GE 7; and paragraph 24 of GE 11 is excerpted from \nGroup X\u2019s Bulletin of January 1994, admitted here as GE 8. Thus, though I may \nconsider those excerpts, their reference in GE 11 is duplicative. GE 11, and its \nconclusions, are otherwise irrelevant.  \n \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits 7 and 8 are newsletters published by Group X in 1990 \nand 1994, respectively. Government Exhibit 9 is printout from Group X\u2019s website, \naccessed in May 2018. These exhibits are discussed below in the Findings of Fact.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the sole allegation under Guideline \nA (SOR \u00b6 1.a) with an explanation, and, by reference, the cross-allegation under \nGuideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a). He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \u2013 2.g, also with explanations. I \nincorporate his admissions and explanations into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. (I also incorporate my factual findings about the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence, discussed above.) \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. He graduated from high school in 1994. (Tr. 147; GE 1) \nHe has never married but has a longtime cohabitant. They have three children, ages 17, \n15, and 13. (Tr. 126-127) He previously worked for a government contractor for several \nyears, until 2001, when he was injured on the job. He received workmen\u2019s \ncompensation, and he was unemployed from September 2001 to October 2013. During \nthat time he was a \u201cstay-at-home dad\u201d raising his children. (GE 1 at 13; Tr. 129-131, \n141) Applicant returned to the workforce in October 2013, and has worked for his \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since October 2014. He has not held a security \nclearance before. (Tr. 9-10, 48, 131-133, GE 1)   \n \nGuideline E  \n \nIn March 1991, Applicant was arrested and charged with breaking and entering \nafter he and some high school friends broke into an office at a mall. (SOR \u00b6 2.c). They \ninitially left the scene, but were arrested when they returned a short time later. He was \nfound guilty in juvenile court, placed on probation, and fined. He attended several weeks \nof counseling and a youth offender program. (GE 3 at 2; GE 5 at \u201cp. 60\u201d; Tr. 66-67) \n \nIn June 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed \nweapon after he was found in possession of a knife while at a mall with friends. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.d) He was found guilty in juvenile court and ordered to perform community service. \n(GE 3 at 2; GE 5 at \u201cp. 60\u201d; Tr. 68-70) \n \nIn November 1993, Applicant was involved in an altercation with numerous other \nstudents at his high school. The altercation was racially motivated. Though Applicant \nclaimed self-defense, others accused him of having a weapon and pressed charges. \n(GE 3 at 2-3) Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery and \nbrandishing a firearm. (SOR \u00b6 2.e) In juvenile court, he pleaded not guilty, but court \nrecords state that evidence was sufficient to convict. There is no indication that a \nconviction was entered, and in December 1994, the charges were dismissed. (GE 5 at \n\u201cp. 60\u201d; Tr. 70-71) \n \nIn March 1994, Applicant was at a party with friends when he had an altercation \nwith an interracial couple. The police were called and Applicant was questioned and \nreleased. The couple then pressed charges. When the police came to Applicant\u2019s home, \nthey searched it and found a sawed-off shotgun. He was arrested and charged with \nassault and battery, and felony possession of a sawed-off shotgun. (SOR \u00b6 2.f) He \ntestified that the weapon was his father\u2019s but that he had altered it. In December 1994, \nhe was convicted on the felony weapon charge and was later sentenced to six years in \njail, all suspended, and six years of probation. He was released from probation in 1999. \n(GE 1; GE 3 at 3; GE 4; Tr. 71-75, 148-149) \n \nIn August 1994, Applicant and several friends vandalized a local black church, \nwhich the record indicates was located in a white neighborhood. He spray-painted racial \nand religious slurs on the church, such as \u201cwhite power,\u201d the phrase \u201cn - - - - - s out,\u201d \n(the phrase includes the racial epithet commonly known as \u201cthe N word\u201d), a \u201cburning \ncross,\u201d and a reference to Adolph Hitler and the \u201cSS\u201d (GE 2 at 4; GE 5 at \u201cp. 45\u201d; Tr. 71-\n76) Applicant was arrested and charged with felony willful and malicious defacement of \nchurch property. In January 1995, he was convicted and sentenced to five years in jail, \nthree years suspended, and ten years of probation. (SOR \u00b6 2.g). (GE 1, GE 4, GE 5) He \nserved ten months in jail and paid a $2,000 fine. He was released from probation early, \nin October 1999. (GE 5 at \u201cp. 38\u201d; Tr. 150). At hearing, though he accepted \nresponsibility for what he did, Applicant denied knowing at the time that it was a black \n\n \n5 \n \n \nchurch. He acknowledged \u201cpainting some pretty offensive stuff on it\u201d and that \u201cit wasn\u2019t \nthat funny.\u201d (Tr. 76)  \n \nApplicant allegedly used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 1986 until 2013. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) More specifically, he tried marijuana once in 1986, when he was 10, \nsmoked it daily from about 1990 to 1995, and again \u201con and off\u201d between November \n2005 and August 2013. (GE 1 at 25; GE 3 at 4; Tr. 134, 138-140) He also \nacknowledged that he procured the marijuana by purchasing it. He resumed using \nmarijuana in 2005 when he joined a band. (Tr. 136-140) \n \nNeither Applicant nor his cohabitant use marijuana. However, he acknowledged \nthat he is around marijuana on a weekly basis, when he is with other band members \nwho use it. He said his friends know better than to offer it to him. He denied any other \nillegal drug use since 2013. He said he does not intend to use marijuana until it is \nlegalized. (Tr. 134-138) He acknowledged that marijuana is illegal under Federal law \nand under the law of his home state. He is subject to drug testing at work. (Tr. 142-143) \n \nGuideline A \n \nAccording to the Government\u2019s evidence, Group X was founded in the early \n1970s. Among its founders was Dr. P. (GE 9 at 16, 18; Tr. 82, 124) Both GE 7 and GE \n8, newsletters published by Group X in 1990 and 1994, contain \u201cCommentary\u201d from Dr. \nP that can generally be described as racist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic. The \ncommentary also advocates racial and religious genocide. (GE 8 at 5) Applicant was not \na member of Group X when those newsletters were published. He denied that Group \nX\u2019s views, as expressed in GE 7 and GE 8 were the views of Group X when he was a \nmember years later. (Tr. 112)  \n \n \nIn March 2000, Applicant was interviewed by an agent of the Defense Security \nService as part of what was probably a security clearance investigation. (GE 3; Tr. 59-\n60, 86) In a portion of his sworn statement, Applicant said he had been a self-described \n\u201cskinhead\u201d since 1991. As such, he described his views concerning white supremacy \nand white separatism as follows:  \n \nI believe that the white race is the most evolved race and should be \npreserved. Any further evolution of the white race should occur within the \nwhite gene pool only. I believe that white people should not socialize or \nbreed with other races. I believe that other races and Jewish people \nshould exist, but within their own specified territory. I don\u2019t like people of \nother races being in a position of authority to me. I don\u2019t think they should \nbe in any positions of power or authority. (GE 3 at 5; Tr. 169-70) \n \nApplicant said in the statement that he regularly used the internet to read and \nlearn about \u201cnational socialist views.\u201d He printed national socialist literature and \ndistributed it. He acknowledged wearing clothes and having tattoos that symbolized his \nbeliefs, including \u201cthe German Cross, the Swastika, the Triskellon (symbol of the South \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAfrican resistance), 88 (symbol of skinhead culture), and the confederate flag.\u201d (GE 3 at \n6)  \n \nApplicant acknowledged at hearing that he had most of those tattoos at the time, \nbut he has since had all but one of them covered up with other tattoos. He still has a \ntattoo of the number \u201c88\u201d on the back of his neck, under his ponytail. He said it \nsymbolized \u201cskinhead culture. He said he has not decided how to cover up that tattoo \n(with another one). (Tr. 62-65, 162-163) \n \nIn the March 2000 statement, Applicant disavowed the use of violence to \n\u201cenforce my beliefs,\u201d or to change the fact that \u201cother races\u201d were \u201cin positions of \npower.\u201d He said, \u201cI plan to use education as opposed to violence to spread my message \nto others.\u201d (GE 3 at 6) He referenced his prior criminal conduct (\u201cvandalism and \nfighting\u201d) and noted that he engaged in those activities when he was \u201cyounger and \nimmature.\u201d He said, \u201cI am not a violent person and do not want to use violence as a \nmeans to accomplish any of my goals.\u201d (GE 3 at 6)  \n \nIn the sworn statement, Applicant also stated that \u201cI am not in any formal group \nor organization of skin heads. I practice this belief system with my girlfriend and my \nfriends.\u201d (GE 3 at 6; Tr. 65) At his hearing, Applicant confirmed that he was not a \nmember of Group X when he made his sworn statement to the DSS Agent. (GE 2). \nHowever, he also acknowledged that he had been contemplating joining the group at \nthe time, and testified that he deliberately waited to join Group X until after he made the \nstatement to the DSS agent so he would not have to declare his membership in the \ngroup during his background interview. (Tr. 83, 86-87, 145-146) \n \nSo I waited a couple of weeks after the -- until after the interview before I \nsent in my application for membership. And I did that intentionally so that \nwhen I did the interview, I wouldn\u2019t have to say I was a member of \nanything, and I wouldn\u2019t be lying. (Tr. 83) \n \nDr. P died in 2002. According to Group X\u2019s website, this led eventually to a \n\u201cleadership vacuum\u201d and some tension about the organization\u2019s future direction. (GE 9 \nat 18-19) Applicant is not named in GE 9, but he confirmed the group\u2019s leadership void \nand resulting \u201cchaos\u201d after Dr. P\u2019s death. (Tr. 88) \n \nApplicant said between 2000 and 2009, he went to group meetings about once or \ntwice a year, at Group X\u2019s meeting hall, in a neighboring state. He acknowledged \nengaging in recruiting efforts, but stopped doing so in about 2007 or 2008. (Tr. 90) He \ndenied attempting to recruit people at work. (Tr. 91)  \n \nApplicant testified that as of about 2004, he no longer considered himself a \n\u201cskinhead.\u201d He considered those individuals \u201cpretty much just a bunch of drunken thugs\u201d \nwho did not have a \u201cprofessional attitude\u201d about anything. He decided to grow his hair \nout and to be more professional. (Tr. 60-61, 159-161) \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant also testified \u201cphilosophically I was \u2013 I left it [Group X] in 2009.\u201d (Tr. 54, \n87, 151) However, \u201cI still found some validity in some of their philosophical beliefs.\u201d (Tr. \n88) For a period of time, he and his cohabitant (whom he had recruited into the group) \nhad little to no involvement with the organization. (\u201cWhen I left it, I left it, we left it,\u201d he \nsaid.)(Tr. 129)  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant was asked by other Group X leaders, whom he knew, to be a \nmember of the board. This led him to change his mind, and he re-engaged. (Tr. 129) \nGroup X was also a corporation chartered in State 1, where Applicant lives. (Tr. 87-89, \n151-152) In February 2012, Applicant filed an annual report with State 1\u2019s regulatory \nauthorities on behalf of Group X, in his capacity as a director and officer. His title is \nlisted as Vice-President and Treasurer. Applicant is listed on the filing documents as the \nState 1 Registered Agent, and his home address is listed as the office address for \nGroup X. His name is typed into the signature block on the 2012 Annual Report. (GE 6 \nat 3) Group X\u2019s registered address is also the home address Applicant gave on his \nSCA, GE 1. \n \nApplicant testified that, as an officer and director of Group X, he attended Group \nX board meetings three or four times a year. He testified that, despite being listed on \nGE 6 as the treasurer for several years, he had no knowledge of Group X\u2019s financial \ninformation. (Tr. 94)  \n \nIn his December 2014 SCA (GE 1) Applicant disclosed that in about April 2014, \nhe and two other board members of what he called \u201ca not for profit corporation\u201d were \nsued in State 1 court. Among the people Applicant names in GE 1 are the treasurer \n(Ms. C) and the president of Group X (Mr. G), as identified in the corporate filing with \nState 1. (GE 6 at 3; Tr. 118-119)  \n \nMr. G is identified on Group X\u2019s website as its chairman at the time. (GE 9 at 19) \nIn late 2014, Mr. G resigned as chairman, and was replaced by Mr. W, the same \nindividual who filed the change of address and change of registered agent form with the \nState 1 agency in January 2015. (GE 6; GE 9 at 19) \n \n \nApplicant did not identify Group X on his December 2014 SCA when he \ndisclosed the lawsuit, though he did list several individuals who were then, or who had \npreviously been, Group X members. (GE 1 at 35; Tr. 118-119) There are no documents \nfrom that lawsuit in the record evidence in this case to definitively identify the parties \ninvolved.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that, being an officer and director of Group X, he was a \ngroup leader, and represented the organization\u2019s beliefs. (Tr. 94) He confirmed in his \ntestimony that Group X\u2019s beliefs, as detailed in GE 9, the 2018 website excerpt, were \ntheir beliefs when Applicant was a member of the Group. (Tr. 99-100)  \n \nApplicant also stated that he knew, from his prior association with Group X, that \n\u201cillegal activity was frowned upon,\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t going to be anything in here that \n\n \n8 \n \n \nsaid \u2018go out and violate people\u2019s rights, or overthrow the government, or do this or do \nthat.\u2019 I already knew that wasn\u2019t in there, at least when I was involved.\u201d (Tr. 110) \nApplicant testified that \u201cit was a very well understood policy of [Group X] that illegal \nactivity would get you kicked out . . . and discussion of it, planning of it, talking about it, \nwas cause for immediate dismissal.\u201d (Tr. 55, 171-172; Answer) In the 1990 newsletter, \nDr. P made a similar statement: \u201cWe have always, as a matter of policy, avoided illegal \nacts or other activity which might bring us into conflict with the government\u2019s law \nenforcement apparatus. . . . in the future we may not be able to avoid such conflict. . . .\u201d \n(GE 7 at 3-4) \n \nApplicant testified that during a board meeting conducted by teleconference,  \n \n[Applicant] had been pressuring the chairman, for some years, to change \nthe direction of [the group], to stop being adversarial towards other people, \nother races. And if we really wanted to preserve our people and our \nculture, that we should really learn to work with people rather than trying to \ntake on the world, that made no sense. And it took several years of finally \ngetting them to agree. We actually changed the bylaws of [the group]. We \ntook a vote on it, by phone. And I believe as soon as the bylaws were \nchanged, that is when the lawsuit kicked off. \u201d (Tr. 121-122; see also Tr. \n124-125, 170-171) \n \nApplicant testified that he submitted a letter of resignation and resigned from \nGroup X and its board in March 2014. That letter is not in evidence. During the lawsuit, \nhe learned that he was still listed as the registered agent for Group X, and was still an \nofficer and a director. He testified that in January 2015, Applicant went on the website of \nthe State 1 regulatory authority and removed his name from Group X\u2019s registration \npapers. (Tr. 117, 152-157; GE 6) Applicant denied that the fact that he had submitted an \nSCA in December 2014 had anything to do with the timing of his actions. (Tr. 158) \nAnnual reports filed by Group X in later years (2016-2018) with State 1 do not list \nApplicant as an officer or director and do not list his home address as Group X\u2019s office \nof record in State 1. (GE 6) \n \n \nApplicant denied ever having a discussion with other Group X members about \nissues relating to sedition or overthrowing the United States Government. (Tr. 55) \nApplicant is a United States citizen. He testified that he has given no thought to \nrenouncing his U.S. citizenship for that of another country. (Tr. 58) \n \nApplicant\u2019s SCA contains several questions about his \u201cAssociation Record.\u201d (GE \n1 at Section 29) Questions asked include: a) whether Applicant had knowingly or \nintentionally ever been a member of an organization \u201cdedicated to the use of violence or \nforce to overthrow the United States Government and which engaged in activities to that \nend . . .\u201d; and b) whether he had ever been a member of an organization \u201cthat \nadvocates or practices commission of acts of violence or force to discourage others \nfrom exercising their rights under the U.S. Constitution or any state of the United States \nwith the specific intent to further such action.\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to both \n\n \n9 \n \n \nquestions, and to all others under Section 29. The Government did not allege in the \nSOR that these answers were deliberately false. (Tr. 186-187) \n \nGE 9, excerpted from the Group X website, details its white supremacist and \nseparatist views, under a subheading, \u201cBuilding a New White World.\u201d The group\u2019s stated \ngoals include \u201cWhite Living Space,\u201d \u201cAn Aryan Society,\u201d \u201cA Responsible Government,\u201d \n\u201cA New Educational System,\u201d and \u201cAn Economic Policy Based on Racial Principles.\u201d \n(GE 9)  \n \nUnder the \u201cResponsible Government\u201d subheading, GE 9 states that due to \u201cthe \ngrowth of mass democracy,\u201d including increased voting enfranchisement of \u201cnon-\nWhites\u201d and the \u201ccontrol over the media\u201d by Jews, \u201cthe U.S. government was gradually \ntransformed into the malignant monster it is today: the single most dangerous and \ndestructive enemy our race has ever known.\u201d (GE 9 at 7) \n \nApplicant denied that through this statement, or otherwise, Group X advocated \nsedition against the United States Government, or sought to \u201coverthrow\u201d it, by violence \nor other means. (Tr. 122-124) He testified,    \n \n[Y]ou are recognizing that apparently there are policies, and programs in \nplace that are dangerous to your people and you have to change that. It \ndoesn\u2019t say anything about violating the law or doing anything like that. . . I \nmean, the government can be considered a threat to many things, life \nliberty, pursuit of happiness, depending on, you know, how you look at it. \nSo I would say that I don\u2019t think declaring it an enemy in, like, a military \nterm. Maybe on a philosophical term. I mean, that it how it reads to me. \n(Tr. 100-101) (discussing GE 9)) \n \nApplicant acknowledged that when he joined Group X, the group believed \u201cthat \nthe government was working against the interest of white people and culture, definitely \nbelieved that, they definitely believed that . . . and so did I . . . .\u201d (Tr. 122) Applicant \ndenied that Group X advocated going out and stopping \u201cother people from doing what \nthey have a constitutional right to do.\u201d (Tr. 103) He also said, \u201cI can\u2019t speak for what it \nstands for now.\u201d (Tr. 103) \n \nApplicant testified that if he had been aware that Group X espoused a philosophy \nof violence or overthrow of the government, he would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d have joined it. (Tr. \n170) He testified that he has not been a member of Group X, and has not attended any \nmeetings for several years. (Tr. 56, 157) Applicant denied any further contact with \nanyone he knew to be a member of Group X. Occasionally, he gets phone calls from \nthe former chairman of Group X, but does not believe the individual remains a member. \n(Tr. 57, 125-126) \n \nApplicant testified that he has never had any issues with coworkers at his current \njob. His coworkers come from a variety of backgrounds, races, and creeds. (Tr. 48, 133; \nAnswer) He testified that, the day before the hearing, he told some of his coworkers, of \n\n \n10 \n \n \nother races, that \u201cI used to be a skinhead, I used to be a white supremacist.\u201d (Tr. 134) \nThis testimony is uncorroborated.  \n \nApplicant denied that he considers himself to be a \u201dskinhead\u201d anymore. (Tr. 160) \nHe also testified that he no longer considers himself to be a white supremacist; indeed, \nhe testified that he \u201ccan\u2019t be\u201d one, because he learned in about 2012 that one of his \ngrandparents, who he had never met, was a Native American. (Tr. 161-162)  \n \n \nWhen asked why his prior membership in Group X should no longer be \nconsidered a security concern, Applicant said,  \n \nWell, I\u2019m not a member. I don\u2019t believe, or ascribe to those views. . . . I \ndon\u2019t know what else to say. I don\u2019t follow any of that philosophy, or \nanything like that, any form of socialism or collectivism, or any of that. (Tr. \n168) \n \nApplicant acknowledged his prior criminal record, has accepted responsibility for \nhis actions, and said he has paid the price. He said he has matured and has not been \n\u201cin trouble\u201d for a long time. (Tr. 168; SOR Answer) To show that he is considered \nrehabilitated by authorities, he testified that he has a concealed handgun permit in his \nhome state. He testified that he successfully applied with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms (ATF) for a permit to build a suppressor for his handgun. He \ntestified that he has been a licensed armed security officer in his home state since \n2009. These assertions are undocumented. He has not committed any other crimes \nbeyond those alleged. He has had his voting rights restored. (Tr. 49-51, 144-145) \nApplicant attested to his patriotism and to the valuable service he provides to the \ncountry and to the U.S. military at work. (Tr. 166) \n \nApplicant provided no documents in support of his case, and he offered no \ncharacter testimony, documented or otherwise. Thus, his own testimony is in all \nrespects uncorroborated by other sources. \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline A, Allegiance to the United States   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 3 sets forth the security concern over an applicant\u2019s allegiance:   \n \nThe willingness to safeguard classified or sensitive information is in doubt \nif there is any reason to suspect an individual's allegiance to the United \nStates. There is no positive test for allegiance, but there are negative \nindicators. These include participation in or support for acts against the \nUnited States or placing the welfare or interests of another country above \nthose of the United States. Finally, the failure to adhere to the laws of the \nUnited States may be relevant if the violation of law is harmful to stated \nU.S. interests. An individual who engages in acts against the United \n\n \n12 \n \n \nStates or provides support or encouragement to those who do has already \ndemonstrated willingness to compromise national security. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 4 describes conditions that could raise a security concern under Guideline \nA and may be disqualifying:  \n \n(a) involvement in, support of, training to commit, or advocacy of any act \nof sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition against the United \nStates; \n \n(b) association or sympathy with persons who are attempting to commit, or \nwho are committing, any of the above acts; and \n \n(c) association or sympathy with persons or organizations that advocate, \nthreaten, or use force or violence, or use any other illegal or \nunconstitutional means, in an effort to: \n \n(1) overthrow or influence the U.S. Government or any state or \nlocal government; \n \n(2) prevent Federal, state, or local government personnel from \nperforming their official duties; \n \n(3) gain retribution for perceived wrongs caused by the Federal, \nstate, or local government; and \n \n(4) prevent others from exercising their rights under the Constitution \nor laws of the United States or of any state. \n \nUnder Guideline A, the Government alleges that until at least January 2015, \nApplicant was a member, high-ranking officer of Group X, an organization that allegedly \nadvocates sedition against the U.S. government, the use of force and violence to \noverthrow and influence the U.S. government, and to prevent others from exercising \ntheir lawful, constitutional rights. (SOR \u00b6 1.a)  \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged that he had been a member \nof Group X, but denied the characterizations and aims of the group as alleged. \nApplicant\u2019s answer puts the burden on the Government to establish that his past \nmembership of Group X is an ongoing, unresolved security concern. \n \nFirst, the Government did not establish, nor did they argue, that Applicant has \nplaced \u201cthe welfare or interests of another country above those of the United States.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 3) No foreign country or entity is involved.  \n \nSecond, though Applicant himself has a 25-year-old criminal record, the \nGovernment neither alleged nor established under Guideline A that Applicant\u2019s \u201cfailure \n\n \n13 \n \n \nto adhere to the laws of the United States\u201d or \u201cviolation of law is harmful to stated U.S. \ninterests.\u201d (AG \u00b6 3) Indeed, the Government did not allege or establish under Guideline \nA that either Applicant or anyone connected with Group X has violated the law or that \ntheir actions in that capacity were unlawful.  \n \nGovernment Exhibit 10 is a reported federal appellate case, published in 1983. \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits 7 and 8 are newsletters published by Group X in 1990 and 1994, \nrespectively, containing \u201cCommentary\u201d from the Group\u2019s founder, now deceased. \nApplicant joined Group X in about 2000, several years after these exhibits were \npublished. Although they describe Group X\u2019s historical views and aims, I give them little \nweight, as they have little to no direct link to Applicant, given their age. By contrast, \nApplicant confirmed in his testimony that the views and beliefs of Group X, as \nexpressed in GE 9, the 2018 website excerpt, were the views of and beliefs of the group \nwhen he was on the board. Thus, I give GE 9 greater weight. I have not relied on GE \n11, the Canadian court case, at all.  \n \nApplicant became a \u201cskinhead\u201d in about 1991, during his teenage years. By \n2000, when he gave a sworn statement to DSS, he was an avowed white supremacist. \nHe researched similar information on the internet, and passed out similar literature to \nthe public. Soon thereafter, he joined Group X, an organization advocating white \nsupremacy and white separatism, and which has a history of espousing racist, anti-\nSemitic and homophobic beliefs, as well as advocating violence against other races, \neven outright genocide. Applicant attended group meetings and engaged in recruiting \nefforts. He recruited his cohabitant into membership. For a time, his interest in Group X \nfaded as they began to raise their family.  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant reengaged with Group X when he was asked to join the board \nof directors. He became the group\u2019s vice-president and treasurer. He was also its \n\u201cregistered agent\u201d in State 1 and Group X\u2019s registered address was the same as \nApplicant\u2019s home. Applicant filed the group\u2019s annual report with State 1 regulatory \nauthorities in 2012. He attended board meetings several times a year. The Government \nhas established that Applicant is a former \u201cmember and high-ranking officer\u201d of Group \nX, as alleged.  \n \nAt hearing, Applicant acknowledged that, being an officer and director of Group \nX, he was a group leader, and represented the organization\u2019s beliefs. Unlike GE 7 and \nGE 8, which he disavowed, Applicant acknowledged that Group X\u2019s views and beliefs \nas expressed in GE 9, the 2018 website excerpt, were their beliefs when Applicant was \na member of the Group. \n \nApplicant testified that when he was on the board, he attempted to influence \nGroup X\u2019s belief system by making it less adversarial towards others. This led, he said, \nto a change in the bylaws, and, ultimately, to a lawsuit over the Group\u2019s future direction, \nin about 2014, in which Applicant was a party. He testified that around this time, in \nMarch 2014, he submitted a resignation letter. All of this is uncorroborated. \n \n\n \n14 \n \n \nApplicant disclosed the lawsuit on GE 1, in December 2014, naming several \nother individuals, some of whom were Group X officers. He was still listed with State 1\u2019s \nregulatory authority as the Group X registered agent as of January 2015.  \n \nThe Government argues that Applicant\u2019s prior involvement in Group X is a \nsecurity concern because Group X advocates \u201csedition\u201d and the \u201coverthrow\u201d of the \nUnited States Government. It cites to certain passages in the record evidence, in \npublications in which Group X asserts, for instance, that the U.S. Government is a \n\u201cmalignant monster\u201d that has become \u201cthe single most dangerous and destructive \nenemy our race has ever known.\u201d  \n \nIn reviewing Group X\u2019s materials, particularly GE 9, I conclude that the \nGovernment has not established that Group X advocates sedition or \u201coverthrow\u201d of the \nU.S. Government, at least with any specificity, let alone with a stated plan of action, \nviolently or otherwise. In essence, Group X advocates, in a way that is vociferous and \ninflammatory, but also vague and conclusory, for a government that is more receptive to \ntheir white supremacist and white separatist views and beliefs, abhorrent and offensive \nthough those views and beliefs surely are.  \n \nApplicant denied Group X advocated sedition against the United States \nGovernment, or sought to \u201coverthrow\u201d it, by violence or other means. He also noted \nseveral times, in his testimony and his Answer, that Group X had a policy forbidding its \nmembers from committing illegal acts. He also testified that if he believed Group X \nadvocated violence, sedition, or overthrow of the U.S. government, he would not have \njoined it.  \n \nWhile the federal appellate opinion in the record (GE 10) is quite dated, some of \nthe court\u2019s findings about the limitations of Group X\u2019s advocacy in 1983 remain apt here. \nThe court found that Group X \u201cfailed to present any reasoned development of its \nconclusions\u201d in its publications; and that \u201cits principal function was the mere \npresentation of unsupported opinion.\u201d The same can be said for the views expressed in \nthe 2018 website excerpt. As such, the Government\u2019s evidence about Group X, and \nabout Applicant\u2019s connections to it, is insufficient to establish that AG \u00b6\u00b6 4(a), 4(b), or \n4(c)(1), 4(c)(2), 4(c)(3), or 4(c)(4) should apply.  \n \n \nI might have reached a different conclusion as to AG \u00b6 4(c) if the record \ncontained evidence that Group X members actually engaged in acts of violence or other \nillegal activity that contradicted their disavowals, or if Applicant, while a Group X \nmember, did so himself. There is no such evidence.  \n \nTo be sure, Applicant does have a history of attempting to \u201cprevent others from \nexercising their rights under the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any \nstate.\u201d Felony willful and malicious defacement of a black church with Nazi references \nand the \u201cN word\u201d surely qualifies under AG \u00b6 4(c)(4), as it was an act seeking to \nintimidate members of the church community and to prevent them from exercising their \nFirst Amendment rights to freedom of speech, religion, association, and assembly. But \n\n \n15 \n \n \nthat conduct was not alleged under Guideline A. I may consider it under Guideline E \nand the whole-person concept, but not here.  \n \nLastly, in considering the strength of the Government\u2019s Guideline A case, it is \nnoteworthy that the Government, while arguing that Applicant was a member of an \norganization that advocated violence, illegal activity, sedition, and the overthrow of the \nU.S. government, did not allege falsification when Applicant did not disclose his \nmembership in Group X on his SCA, despite several questions calling for disclosure of \nmembership of organizations with such aims.  \n \nFor all of these reasons, I conclude that the Government did not meet its burden \nto establish a security concern under either the Guideline A \u201cgeneral concern\u201d or any of \nthe possible disqualifying conditions. SOR \u00b6 1.a is found for Applicant. Having so \nconcluded, I need not address applicability of the Guideline A mitigating conditions, \ndetailed under AG \u00b6 5.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative proceedings. . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation; and  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, \nbut which, \nwhen combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly \n\n \n16 \n \n \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is not \nlimited to, consideration of: . . . \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; . . .  \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; . . .[and]  \n \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \nBetween 1991 and 1994, Applicant was arrested for several criminal offenses. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c \u2013 2.g) These offenses were not alleged under the criminal conduct \nadjudicative guideline (Guideline J, AG \u00b6 30), but might have been. Under Guideline E, \nthey satisfy the \u201ccatch-all\u201d AGs, \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(2) (for disruptive, inappropriate, and at \ntimes violent behavior), 16(d)(3) (a pattern of rule violations); 16(e)(1), and 16(g), as \nwell as the \u201cgeneral concern\u201d under Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15 (conduct involving \nquestionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations).  \n \nSimilarly, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.b) was not alleged under \nGuideline H, the drug involvement adjudicative guideline (AG \u00b6 24) but might have \nbeen. The above AGs under Guideline E are also satisfied as to that allegation. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s prior membership and high-level \ninvolvement in Group X as a personal conduct security concern. As an initial matter, an \napplicant\u2019s security-related conduct may be alleged under more than one guideline, \nand, in an appropriate case, may be given independent weight under different \nguidelines. (See ISCR Case No. 04-09251 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2007)) It is also \nlegally permissible for an administrative judge to consider an applicant\u2019s conduct under \nboth and to reach different conclusions under both, so long as the judge articulates a \nrational basis for each. (See id.)  \n \nAs discussed at length above, I did not find that any disqualifying conditions \nunder Guideline A were applicable. Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s membership in Group X \n(from about 2000 to early 2015) and participation as an officer and director of Group X \n(from 2012 to early 2015) is a potential security concern under Guideline E.  \n \n \nGroup X advocates white supremacy and separatism. Applicant, a self-described \n\u201cskinhead\u201d and white supremacist, joined the group in 2000. Though his interest waned \nfor a time, in 2012, he became an officer and director of the group in 2012, as well as its \n\n \n17 \n \n \nregistered agent in State 1. The Group X office address in State 1 was Applicant\u2019s \npersonal residence.  \n \n \nThere is no specific prohibition against associating with such groups. However, \nApplicant\u2019s membership in Group X and his high-level participation calls into question \nhis awareness of potential security concerns, as well as his judgment.  \n \nFor instance, Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment at hearing that he deliberately waited \nuntil after his March 2000 interview statement to join Group X so he would not have to \neither declare his membership in the group, or lie to the interviewing agent about it, is \nparticularly troubling. The deliberateness of Applicant\u2019s thought process in that instance \nserves to bolster the case that he knew his membership in the Group X was, or at least \nmight be, a security concern.  \n \nThen, of course, Applicant not only joined the Group as a member (later in 2000), \nhe became an officer and director. As such, as he acknowledged, he was a group \nleader, and represented the organization\u2019s beliefs. (Tr. 94) He also confirmed in his \ntestimony that Group X\u2019s beliefs, as detailed in GE 9, the 2018 website excerpt, were \ntheir beliefs when Applicant was a member of the Group.  \n \nThe Directive presumes a nexus between admitted or proved conduct under any \nof the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. \n15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). The required nexus is shown because several \nGuideline E disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s membership in Group X and his deepening involvement as an officer \nand director, all of which occurred after his 2000 security interview, establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c), 16(d); 16(e)(1), as well as the \u201cgeneral concern\u201d under Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15 for \nquestionable judgment.  \n \nIt is not sufficiently established that Applicant\u2019s membership in and leadership of \nGroup X constitutes association with persons involved in criminal activity. As to SOR \u00b6 \n2.a, AG \u00b6 16(g) is not established.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E:   \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n\n \n18 \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nApplicant was arrested several times between 1991 and 1994. Most of these \noffenses occurred when he was in high school. Applicant has not had any arrests since \nthen. While Applicant\u2019s defacement of the black church in August 1994 requires further \nanalysis, his other, earlier offenses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c-2.f) are mitigated by the passage of \ntime, under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s felony willful and malicious defacement of the black church, however, \nis a different matter. Despite its age (25 years ago), the offense\u2019s racial context remains \nrelevant to this case, given Applicant\u2019s admitted beliefs about white supremacy and \nwhite separatism (in a 2000 statement) his subsequent long-time membership in an \navowed white supremacist and white separatist group, and his participation as an officer \nand board member of the group from 2012 to 2015. It is therefore harder to mitigate \nSOR \u00b6 2.g on the basis of passage of time. His recent membership and involvement in \nsuch a group significantly limits any claim that Applicant is fully reformed and \nrehabilitated. He also testified at hearing that at the time he committed the act, he did \nnot know it was a black church. Given the record evidence of what was written on the \nchurch, this is simply not credible. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply to mitigate SOR \n\u00b6 2.g.  \n \nApplicant became a self-described \u201cskinhead\u201d in about 1991. By 2000, he was an \navowed white supremacist. He joined Group X, an organization advocating white \nsupremacy and white separatism, and which has a history of espousing racist, anti-\nSemitic and homophobic beliefs. As already discussed, he deliberately waited until after \nhis 2000 background interview to join Group X, so he would not have to disclose his \nmembership to the interviewing agent, or would have to lie to avoid doing so.  \n \nApplicant was a member of Group X member for about 15 years (2000-2015) \nand was an officer and director of the Group from 2012-2015. He had longtime and \ndeep involvement. He said that he resigned in 2014, and is no longer involved with the \ngroup or its members. (With respect to his beliefs on white supremacy, Applicant did not \nactually disavow those beliefs during his testimony. Instead, he testified that he \u201ccan\u2019t \nbe\u201d a white supremacist because he learned he has a Native American ancestor). \n \nApplicant testified that he \u201cphilosophically\u201d left Group X in about 2009. However, \nthe record also makes clear that in fact his involvement later deepened, as between \n2012 and January 2015, he was an officer and director of Group X, its registered agent \nin State 1, and Group X\u2019\u2019s registered office in State 1 was the same as his residence.  \n \nThus, there is record evidence of two separate instances, many years apart, of \nApplicant\u2019s lack of candor to the government about his involvement with Group X. In \naddition, it is noteworthy that in his answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged his \nprior membership in Group X, but did not address his involvement as an officer or \ndirector.  \n\n \n19 \n \n \nI may not consider these instances of Applicant\u2019s lack of candor as disqualifying \nconduct, since they were not alleged in the SOR. However, I may consider them in \nweighing mitigation or changed circumstances, whether Applicant has demonstrated \nsufficient rehabilitation, under the whole person concept, and, most importantly here, in \nweighing Applicant\u2019s credibility. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).  \n \nApplicant submitted no documentary evidence to corroborate any of his \ntestimony. No character witnesses testified on his behalf. His case in mitigation, \nparticularly as to his connections to Group X, therefore rests entirely on his own \ncredibility. This makes Applicant\u2019s multiple instances of lack of candor, particularly \nproblematic.  \n \n \nApplicant has a constitutional right to believe whatever he wants. He has a \nconstitutional right to associate with whomever he wants. He does not have a \nconstitutional right to a clearance. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528). To be determined \neligible for access to classified information, Applicant must rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate security significant conduct or circumstances established by the Government \nand he has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nI have doubts about the credibility of Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that \nhe is no longer a member of Group X, and has disassociated himself from it. (For \ninstance, Applicant acknowledged that, while he has covered up most of his white \nsupremacist and skinhead tattoos, he has one left \u2013 the number \u201c88,\u201d which he \nacknowledged was a symbol of skinhead culture. That tattoo remains \u2013 under his \nponytail, where no one can see it.) My doubts are exacerbated by his multiple instances \nof lack of candor to the Government about his connections to Group X, which stretch \nfrom his March 2000 statement to his testimony in this hearing.  \n \nThese instances of lack of candor towards the Government about Applicant\u2019s \ninvolvement with Group X call into question the truthfulness of his testimony that he has \nresigned form Group X, that he is no longer associated with Group X or any of its \nmembers. The fact that Applicant evidenced lack of candor, including at hearing, about \nthe recency of his involvement with Group X calls the very recency of his involvement \nwith the group into question and causes doubt over whether his involvement with Group \nX and its beliefs is as in the past as he says it is. As to SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate SOR \u00b6 2.a under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), or 17(e).  \n \nThis leaves Applicant\u2019s marijuana use. (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant used marijuana \nmostly in high school, but resumed using it from 2005 to 2013. He testified that he has \nnot used it since. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is not particularly recent. However, he is \naround marijuana weekly, with members of his band. Applicant acknowledged his \nunderstanding that marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and under the law of his \nhome state. Ordinarily, Applicant\u2019s marijuana might be mitigated by the passage of time. \nHowever, given my conclusions about Applicant\u2019s lack of candor, addressed above, his \nuncorroborated testimony that he avoids marijuana use despite being around it weekly, \nis not enough to assuage my doubts that SOR \u00b6 2.b is fully mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a).  \n\n \n20 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines A and E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant, through his \nuncorroborated testimony, did not provide sufficient evidence to meet his burden of \nrelieving all doubts about his security significant conduct. He has not met his burden of \nestablishing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest that he be granted \naccess to classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for continued access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline A:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.b, 2.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n21 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 2, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline C, \nforeign preference, and Guideline B, foreign influence. The action was taken under \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.1 \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 25, 2017 (Answer), and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 13, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \n1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.

He indicated that when he traveled to Egypt, he did so on his U.S. passport; upon \narrival in Egypt, he used his Egyptian passport as identification to show that he was an \nEgyptian citizen, because it was convenient for him to do so. He relinquished his \nEgyptian passport to his facility security officer (FSO) when he received the SOR in \n2017. He testified that he had no intentions of retrieving his Egyptian passport from his \nFSO or obtaining another Egyptian passport in the future.6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s second ex-wife is a citizen and resident of Egypt; their son is a dual \ncitizen of the United States and Egypt, residing with Applicant\u2019s second ex-wife in Egypt \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b). Applicant married his second ex-wife in Egypt. He sponsored her \nmove to the United States, but she never became a U.S. citizen. She returned to Egypt \nin November 2015 with their son, and Applicant testified that he has not since had \ncontact with either of them. She works as an accountant for a bank in Egypt. Applicant \nwas unaware whether the bank was affiliated with the Egyptian government. Applicant \ntestified that she has custody of their son, according to Egyptian law, until he reaches \nage 15, at which point he can choose the parent with whom he wants to live. Applicant \npays $170 USD monthly in child support, as ordered by an Egyptian court, through a \nmoney transfer service in which he wires the money to his 54-year-old brother.7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, former mother-in-law, four brothers, and sister are citizens \nand residents of Egypt. His former mother-in-law and sister are employed by the \nEgyptian government, and his one brother was formerly employed by the Egyptian \ngovernment (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c - 2.g). He has not spoken to his former mother-in-law since his \n2017 divorce. He indicated in his SCA that she worked for the Egyptian government. He \ntestified that he visits his family in Egypt approximately once every two to three years, \nand he did so in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2016. He planned to visit them less \nin the future, and testified that he would do so using his U.S. passport. He testified that \nnone of his family in Egypt are aware that he is seeking to maintain his eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information, and do not know the nature of his work.8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 79 years old. His 54-year-old brother lives with her. She \nhas never worked outside of the home. Applicant\u2019s father was a teacher for the Egyptian \nDepartment of Education (DOE); he died when Applicant was 14 years old. Applicant\u2019s \nmother has supported herself through Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s pension from the Egyptian \ngovernment. She is diabetic, and she also receives health benefits from the Egyptian \ngovernment. Applicant talks to her by telephone once every two to three weeks, \nprimarily about her health. He sees her when he travels to Egypt.9 \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 33-42, 80, 93; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n7 Tr. at 42-46, 71, 92-93; GE 1, 2; AE E. \n \n8 Tr. at 47-80; GE 1. \n \n9 Tr. at 47-77, 90-92; GE 1, 2. \n\n \n4 \nApplicant\u2019s four brothers are ages 60, 56, 54, and 45. All of them performed \nmandatory service in the Egyptian military. The 60-year-old brother is married with two \nchildren. He works as a translator in Saudi Arabia, the details of which Applicant was \nunaware. His wife and children continue to live in Egypt. Applicant talks to him once \nevery several years. Applicant was unaware whether this brother had any affiliations \nwith the Egyptian government or military.10  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 56-year-old brother is married with four to five children. He works for \na hotel in Dubai. Applicant talks to him by telephone once every six months to a year. \nApplicant testified that this brother does not have any affiliations with the Egyptian \ngovernment or military.11 \n \nApplicant\u2019s 54-year-old brother is married with two children. This brother lives \nwith their mother. He is retired from the Egyptian military and receives a military \npension. Applicant was unaware whether this brother maintained any contacts in the \nEgyptian military. Applicant testified that this brother was trying to start his own \nbusiness, but Applicant was unaware of further details. Applicant talks to him once \nevery month to two.12 \n \nApplicant\u2019s 45-year-old brother is married with three children. He used to work for \nthe Egyptian DOE. As of Applicant\u2019s Answer, this brother was working in Bahrain as an \ninformation technology specialist and teacher at a private school. Applicant did not \nbelieve this brother had any current affiliations with the Egyptian government or military. \nThis brother\u2019s wife and children continue to live in Egypt. Applicant talks to this brother \ntwo to three times yearly. Applicant sent him $400 in around early 2018, because this \nbrother told him that work was not going well and he needed to send money to his \nfamily in Egypt.13 \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister is 50 years old. She is married with five children. She works as \na teacher for the Egyptian DOE. Her husband owns a pharmacy. Applicant did not \nbelieve her husband was affiliated with the Egyptian government or military. Applicant \ntalks to her by telephone once every three to four months.14 \n \nApplicant\u2019s fifth brother, age 57, is a dual citizen of Egypt and the United States, \nand has resided in the United States since approximately 1990. He is married with four \nchildren; all are U.S. citizens. He works in media. Applicant talks and sees this brother \noften. This brother occasionally sends money to their mother.15 \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 47-77, 87-89; GE 1, 2. \n \n11 Tr. at 47-77; GE 1, 2. \n \n12 Tr. at 47-77, 86-87; GE 1, 2. \n \n13 Tr. at 47-77, 85; GE 1, 2. \n \n14 Tr. at 47-77, 85-86; GE 1. \n \n15 Tr. at 49-51, 88-91; GE 1, 2. \n\n \n5 \nFrom 2008 to 2016, Applicant owned an apartment in Egypt; its value as of his \nSCA was approximately $40,000 USD (SOR \u00b6 2.h). With help from his mother and \nsiblings, he purchased it for approximately $10,000 USD from his 60-year-old brother, \nwith the idea that he would use it with his family when he traveled to Egypt. He sold it \nfor $25,000 USD to a distant relative, and he gave all of the proceeds to his family in \nEgypt. At the time of his SCA, he also had a bank account in Egypt. He opened it with \n$200 USD between 2012 and 2014. He had returned to Egypt to live, while working as a \nmedical interpreter for a U.S. company and completing his master\u2019s degree, to spend \ntime with his then-wife and son and complete their paperwork to immigrate to the United \nStates. He opened the account in the event he needed to transfer money to the United \nStates. He testified that he never used it. He does not own any other foreign property or \nhave any other foreign financial interests. He testified that he does not stand to own his \nmother\u2019s property in Egypt, which will likely be inherited by his siblings who live there.16  \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s annual salary was approximately \n$53,000. He was renting a room in the United States since 2016, in the home of a friend \nwho was also a prior roommate from 2006. He has leased a car for three years and \nplanned to buy it. He has a bank account in the United States with a balance of \napproximately $1,800. He has a retirement account with a balance of approximately \n$13,000. He does not have any other assets in the United States. He was not affiliated \nwith any foreign governments. He has received annual security training. He testified that \nhe would report any attempts to blackmail or his family to his FSO.17 \n \nA friend of Applicant since obtaining their certification together in 2011 testified \nthat Applicant is a solid and trustworthy man. Another friend, was Applicant\u2019s former \nroommate in 2006 and is Applicant\u2019s current landlord, held a public trust position as of \nthe date of the hearing. The witness testified that he met Applicant\u2019s brother in the \nUnited States on at least two occasions, and he previously met Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and \nchild. He testified that he did not believe Applicant to be a threat to the United States, \nand described Applicant as a trustworthy man. Applicant\u2019s supervisor since March 2017 \nstated that Applicant was a responsible caretaker of sensitive information and an asset \nto the team. She rated him favorably in his 2016 to 2017 performance evaluation. Other \ncharacter references described Applicant as a dedicated, compassionate, and honest \nindividual.18 \n \nEgypt \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens of threats from terrorist \ngroups in Egypt, and to consider the risks of travel to the country. A number of terrorist \ngroups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have committed multiple \ndeadly attacks in Egypt. U.S. diplomatic personnel are prohibited from travel in parts of \nEgypt, and U.S. citizens are warned to avoid those areas. \n                                                          \n16 Tr. at 41-77, 80-85, 93-94; GE 1, 2; AE D. \n \n17 Tr. at 41-78, 80-85; GE 1; AE G, H, I. \n \n18 Tr. at 94-108; AE F, G. \n\n \n6 \n \nSignificant human rights problems in Egypt include excessive use of force by \nsecurity forces; deficiencies in due process; and the suppression of civil liberties, \nincluding societal and government restrictions on freedoms of expression and the \npress, and the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association. Political protests occur \nwithout warning in Egypt. Demonstrations have led to frequent violent clashes between \npolice and protestors, resulting in deaths, injuries, and property damage. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b.   \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for foreign preference is set out in AG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns   \nunder AG \u00b6 10. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \n \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued by \nany country other than the United States; \n \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military \norganization; and \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in any way that conflicts with \nU.S. national security interests; and \n \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country in violation of U.S. law. \n \nApplicant is an Egyptian citizen by virtue of being born there. There is no \nevidence that he failed to report or disclose to an appropriate security official his \npossession of an Egyptian passport, or that he failed to use his U.S. passport when \nentering or exiting the United States. He disclosed his Egyptian citizenship and passport \non his SCA and during his background interviews. He indicated that he traveled to \n\n \n8 \nEgypt on his U.S. passport, and he only presented his Egyptian passport upon arrival \nout of convenience, as identification that he was an Egyptian citizen. He surrendered his \nEgyptian passport to his FSO upon receipt of the SOR. There is no evidence that he \nparticipated in any foreign activities, or that he used his Egyptian citizenship to protect \nhis financial interests in Egypt in violation of U.S. law. He sold his property there in \n2016, and he credibly testified that he has not used his Egyptian bank account since he \nopened it between 2012 and 2014. None of the potentially disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 10 are established, and I find SOR \u00b6 1.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a trustworthiness concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a trustworthiness concern if \nthey create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns   \nunder AG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant sold his property in Egypt in 2016. He credibly testified that he has not \nused his Egyptian bank account since he opened it between 2012 and 2014. AG \u00b6 7(f) \nis not established, and I find SOR \u00b6 2.h in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\n \n9 \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe \nUnited States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding sensitive \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. \nBd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their \nvital interests or national security.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at \n**15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields.  \n \nNevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the \nUnited States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood \nthat an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk \nof coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has \nan authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. Applicant has not spoken to his mother-in-\nlaw since he divorced his second wife in 2017. In addition, his one brother was also no \nlonger employed by the Egyptian government as of the date of the hearing.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) \nand 7(b) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.f, and I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.f in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, one brother, sister, second ex-wife, and son, are citizens and \nresidents of Egypt. His sister is employed by the Egyptian government. His three other \nbrothers who are citizens of Egypt and resided in Egypt at the time of the SOR, no longer \nresided there as of the date of the hearing; though the wives and children for at least two \nof these three brothers did. While Applicant divorced his second wife in 2017, she is the \nmother of their minor son. Though he indicated that he has not had contact with either \nhis second wife or their son since 2015, he provides monthly financial support for his \nson. Terrorist activities and significant human rights abuses are present in Egypt. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts in Egypt create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, \n2.c, 2.e, and 2.g. \n \n \n\n \n10 \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence trustworthiness concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the above discussion \nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). AG \u00b6 8(c) is also not established, as Applicant visited his \nfamily in Egypt once every year to two between 2009 and 2016. He communicates with \nhis mother once every two to three weeks. He communicates with his brother and sister \nwho reside in Egypt once every month to four months. He provided financial support to \nhis one brother in 2018, so that this brother could support his wife and children in Egypt. \nAs previously discussed, though he divorced his second wife in 2017 and indicated that \nhe has not had contact with either her or their minor son since 2015, he provides \nmonthly financial support for his son.  \n \nApplicant has lived and worked in the United States since 2000. He received a \nlanguage certificate and a master\u2019s degree in the United States. He became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2008. Though he has a bank account in Egypt, he stated that \nhe has not used it since he opened it between 2012 and 2014, and he sold his property \nin Egypt in 2016. His financial interests in the United States, on the other hand, include \nhis annual salary of $53,000, and his retirement and bank accounts totaling \napproximately $14,800. These are factors that weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, \nApplicant\u2019s ties to his family in Egypt are equally as strong. Applicant failed to meet his \nburden to demonstrate that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \n\n \n11 \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines C and B in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under both \nguidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign preference trustworthiness concerns, but \nhe has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised by his ex-wife, son, mother, \none brother, and sister in Egypt. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden \nof showing that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:  \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing (NOH) on December 8, 2017, \nscheduling the hearing for January 22, 2018. A notice of cancellation for that hearing \nwas issued on January 19, 2018, due to the U.S. Government shutdown. A second \nNOH was issued on April 9, 2018, scheduling the hearing for May 18, 2018. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled.2 \n \nI marked the Government\u2019s discovery letter, request for administrative notice, \nand exhibit list as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I, II, and III, and Applicant\u2019s exhibit list as HE \nIV. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough N, which were admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on June 6, 2018.  \n                                                                                                                                                       \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c. He denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 2.a. He is 50 years old. He married in 2000, divorced in 2009, and \nremarried in 2010. He has four minor children. All are native-born U.S. citizens. His \neldest child is from a prior relationship. His second child is from his prior marriage. His \nyoungest two children are from his current marriage.3  \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1986. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1990 and a master\u2019s degree in 2002. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1990 to 1994, \nwhen he was honorably discharged. He has since worked for various defense \ncontractors. As of the date of the hearing, he worked as a senior engineer for his current \nemployer, for whom he has worked since late February 2015. He previously worked for \nthe same company from June 2007 to February 2009. He was first granted a security \nclearance in 1990.4  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Russia. She is 33 years old. She earned a \nbachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree from a university in Russia in around 2002 and 2009, \nrespectively. She first immigrated to the United States in 2004. She then returned to \nRussia, where she married her first spouse, who was then a Russian citizen, in 2005. \nHer first spouse is now a U.S. citizen residing in the United States. They immigrated to \nthe United States in 2005 and divorced in 2007. She remarried a Ukrainian national in \n2009 and they lived together in the United States. She then returned to Russia in 2009 \nfor one month to finish her master\u2019s degree, after which time she returned to the United \nStates. She divorced her second spouse in 2010.5 \n                                                     \n2 Tr. at 7-8. \n \n3 Response to the SOR; Tr. at 36, 39-41, 75, 77, 85; GE 1, 2; AE D, K, N.                    \n \n4 Tr. at 36-39, 43-51, 97-98; GE 1, 2; AE A, D, F. \n \n5 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2; AE B, D, K, L, M, N. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2014. She renounced her \nRussian citizenship in 2016. She has worked as a business financial manager for an \nengineering firm since May 2015. The company\u2019s partner, who is also the facility \nsecurity officer (FSO), indicated that while Applicant\u2019s wife does not need a security \nclearance, she has received security training like those who do. He described her as a \nvalued and trusted employee who safeguards the company\u2019s confidential, sensitive, and \nproprietary information. He also indicated that she appears to be a loyal American \ncitizen.6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nRussia. His parents-in-law divorced in 2010. His father-in-law is 60 years old. Applicant \ntestified that his wife\u2019s father is estranged from the family. She talks to her father several \ntimes yearly, and she has seen him three times between 2008 and 2018. Her father met \nher during one of her trips to Russia so that he could meet his grandson. Applicant has \nnever met or talked to his father-in-law. Applicant is unaware whether his father-in-law is \ncurrently employed, and his wife believes her father is retired. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nis a former Russian military officer. Applicant testified that his father-in-law served in the \nRussian military for several years from around 1983 to 1985, before he was discharged \nfor stealing rubbing alcohol.7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is 60 years old. She works as an accountant for a \nbrewery. His brother-in-law is 24 years old. After Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law graduated \nfrom college, he completed one year of mandatory service in the Russian military in \naround December 2017. He works as a chemist for a private pharmaceutical company. \nApplicant was unaware if his brother-in-law had any ongoing affiliations with the \nRussian government or military. Applicant\u2019s wife video chats with her mother once \nweekly. She is close to her brother and talks to him more frequently, at least several \ntimes weekly and most recently because of his imminent wedding. His mother-in-law \nspeaks \u201cvery little\u201d English and Applicant speaks \u201cvery little\u201d Russian, so he simply says \n\u201chello\u201d and ensures that his children do the same on the occasions that his wife talks to \nher mother. He has a similar relationship with his brother-in-law.8 \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Russia in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014. He followed security \nclearance protocol and reported such travels to his FSO. His wife travels to Russia once \nyearly, and she stays with her mother during such visits. Though Applicant planned to \ntravel to Russia with his family to attend his brother-in-law\u2019s wedding and celebrate his \n50th birthday, he elected not to do so while his clearance decision was pending. His wife \nand two children planned to attend her brother\u2019s wedding in Russia, where they would \nstay in a condominium paid for by her brother. His mother-in-law and brother-in-law \nhave visited and stayed with them in the United States. They did so before Applicant \nand his wife married, and his mother-in-law did so again after the birth of their son in \n                                                     \n6 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2; AE B, D, K, L, M, N. \n \n7 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2; AE D, L, M, N. \n \n8 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2; AE D, L, M, N. \n\n \n4 \n \n2013 for six months. She has attempted to revisit them since but her visa has been \ndenied at least three times.9 \n \n \nIn around 2013, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law sold her condominium in Russia, and \ngave $90,000 of the proceeds to Applicant and his wife, which they used as a deposit \nfor their home in the United States. Applicant reported this monetary gift to his FSO. \nThey have not received any additional money and his wife does not have standing to \ninherit any money from anyone in Russia. They do not have any assets, obligations, or \naffiliations in Russia. Their assets in the United States total around $1,840,000.10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws in Russia are aware that he works as an engineer. He has not \ntold them that he holds a security clearance or works on U.S. Government contracts. He \nis unaware if his wife has ever disclosed this information to them; she indicated that she \nhas not shared information about Applicant\u2019s work or need for a clearance to any \nforeign national, to include her mother and brother. Applicant is unaware whether his in-\nlaws in Russia have ever been approached by anyone in the Russian government or \nmilitary seeking information about him or his employment. He testified that he would \nreport to his FSO and the proper authorities any attempts by anyone in Russia to \nblackmail him.11 \n \n \nApplicant looked at pornography on his work computer from around February \n2014 through February 2015. At the time, he had been working for a subcontractor \nsince 2008. He attributed his actions to the \u201cgross miscalculation\u201d he made as a result \nof an \u201cextreme amount of stress\u201d from 2013 through 2015. His eldest child was born in \n2013 with a medical condition requiring multiple surgeries through 2015, as well as \ncontinuous checkups every six months indefinitely. He described this experience as a \n\u201ctraumatic\u201d one. In addition, he and his wife \u201cwere not in a good spot at all\u201d after she had \ndisclosed to him that she had multiple affairs between 2013 and 2015.12 \n \n \nInitially, Applicant only looked at pornography at home. When he became \naddicted to it, he also looked at pornography at work. He testified that pornography:   \n \n[w]as my outlet, that was my release. Whether it was five, ten minutes, \nyou know, before work started. Ten, 20, 30 minutes after work . . . before I \nwent home . . . It relaxed me. It prepared me for going home and having to \nwork through everything that was going on in the house. \n \nHe also acknowledged that he looked at pornography at work at lunch time. He \nestimated that he looked at pornography at work an average of 15 to 30 minutes daily. \n                                                     \n9 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2; AE D, L, M, N. \n \n10 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2, 5; AE A, D, E, L, M, N. \n \n11 Tr. at 78-90, 94-97, 105-112; GE 1, 2, 5; AE A, D, E, L, M, N. \n \n12 Tr. at 36-77, 90-93, 98-99; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; AE G, N. \n\n \n5 \n \nHe maintained that it never interfered with his work. He did not tell anyone at the time \nthat he was looking at pornography at work because he knew it was improper.13 \n \n \nIn early February 2015, the primary defense contractor removed Applicant from \nthe U.S. Government contract to which he had been assigned through his subcontractor \ncompany. His program manager informed him that computer monitoring revealed that \nhe had been accessing pornography on his work computer. He immediately reported his \nremoval and the reason for his removal to his company\u2019s President, Vice President, and \nFSO. He was placed on administrative leave by his company during the two-week \nperiod in which the primary contractor conducted its investigation, then he was \nterminated by his company in around mid-February 2015.14  \n \n \nThe investigation conducted by the primary contractor, summarized in an April 2, \n2015 letter, consisted of a forensic examination of Applicant\u2019s computer, an interview of \nthe contract\u2019s technical lead, and a review of Applicant\u2019s time sheets, contract \ndocuments, and internet logs. Applicant was never interviewed. The investigation \ndetermined that Applicant viewed pornography during periods that were billed to the \nU.S. Government. As such, the primary contractor indicated that it would issue to the \nU.S. Government a credit of $21,577.15 \n \n \nApplicant denied that he ever mischarged to the government contract any time in \nwhich he looked at pornography at work. He testified that he was aware that the primary \ndefense contractor paid $20,000 to the U.S. Government agency in association with his \nalleged mischarging; his company repaid the primary contractor $20,000 at the latter\u2019s \nrequest; he was unaware how the amount of $20,000 was quantified; and he was never \nasked to repay any money. He acknowledged during his July 2016 background \ninterview that the $20,000 was restitution for an established 100 hours of computer use \nduring work hours for personal purposes. A May 2016 letter memorializing a meeting \nbetween Applicant, his attorney, and debarment officials, reflects that \u201cit was clear that \n[Applicant] has accepted responsibility for mischarging a government contract for \nmisspent time.\u201d16 \n \n \nApplicant was placed under surveillance for one year by his company\u2019s ethics \ncommittee from 2016 to 2017. He was required to report his time and his computer was \nmonitored, as further discussed below. He has had no other unfavorable issues. He \ntestified that it was not easy for him to stop looking at pornography at work. Once he \nwas terminated by his prior company, he sought help for the first time. He voluntarily \nattended multiple Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA) meetings for two and a half years to \naddress his addiction. He no longer feels he is addicted to pornography, he intends to \ncontinue to attend SAA meetings in the future, and he does not intend to look at \n                                                     \n13 Tr. at 36-77, 90-94, 98-101; GE 2, 3, 4, 5. \n \n14 Tr. at 36-77, 90-93, 98-101; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; AE A, F, G, H, I. \n \n15 Tr. at 56-77, 90-94, 98-101; GE 2, 3; AE H, I, J. \n \n16 Tr. at 36-77, 90-94, 98-104, 113-115; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, F, G, H, I, J. \n\n \n6 \n \npornography on his work computer in the future. He eventually disclosed his conduct of \nviewing pornography at work and his consequent termination to his wife, who supports \nhis SAA attendance and has herself attended such meetings. He handles stress by \nworking out, playing games on his phone, and keeping busy with his family.17 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s character witness was a vice president for the defense contractor for \nwhom they worked. He was also Applicant\u2019s division director and direct supervisor of \nthree years. He has held a security clearance at various occasions over a 30-year-\nperiod. Though the witness was not involved in rehiring Applicant, he testified that \nApplicant had self-reported his issue with his prior defense contracting company to both \nthe witness and his predecessor, and despite such knowledge, the predecessor chose \nto rehire Applicant. He testified that he was aware that Applicant viewed pornography \non his work computer during his off hours while employed by the prior defense \ncontractor; he self-reported his conduct to his then-employer; and Applicant had to \nleave that company after he was consequently removed from the contract. The witness \ntestified that he was unaware that any allegations were ever substantiated concerning \nApplicant mischarging his prior employer for time associated with his pornography \nusage at work.18 \n \n \nThe witness testified that he discussed the matter with an individual from \nApplicant\u2019s prior employer, who described Applicant\u2019s conduct as a mistake and \nindicated that Applicant had otherwise been trustworthy. The witness also testified that \nhe discussed the matter directly with Applicant and brought it to the attention of their \nemployer\u2019s ethics committee. The committee, noting that Applicant did not have any \nunfavorable issues during his previous employment with their company, placed \nApplicant on a one-year observation period beginning in around July 2016, which \ncoincided with Applicant\u2019s proposed debarment period.19  \n \n \nDuring this time, Applicant reported his time to the witness daily, his computer \naccess was monitored, and the government contractor to which he was assigned was \nasked to provide any relevant observations. At the year\u2019s conclusion, the committee \ndetermined that there was no longer a need for further observation of Applicant and the \nproposed debarment had also ended. Applicant continued, however, to report to the \nwitness. The witness has received favorable reports of Applicant\u2019s performance, and \nrated Applicant outstanding in his performance evaluations. He testified that Applicant \nhas complied with annual security and ethics trainings, and he considers Applicant \ntrustworthy, of good judgment, and capable of following rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s FSO since 2010 described Applicant as an individual who follows security \nrules and procedures. His FSO also indicated that Applicant has completed his annual \nsecurity training requirements. 20 \n                                                     \n17 Tr. at 36-77, 90, 98, 104-105, 112-113; GE 1, 2, 4; AE C, G, I, N. \n \n18 Tr. at 17-35. \n \n19 Tr. at 17-35. \n \n20 Tr. at 17-35; AE A. \n\n \n7 \n \nRussia \n \n \nIn 2016, Russia continued to be a leading state intelligence threat to U.S. \ninterests. Its intelligence services target U.S. and allied personnel with access to \nsensitive computer network information. It is assuming a more assertive cyber posture \nbased on its willingness to target critical infrastructure systems and conduct espionage \noperations, even when detected and under increased public scrutiny. It has developed a \nground-launched cruise missile that the United States has declared is in violation of the \nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. \n \n \nRussia remains one of the top two most aggressive and capable collectors of \nsensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace. Non-\ncyberspace collection methods include targeting of U.S. visitors overseas, especially if \nthe visitors are assessed as having access to sensitive information. Russia\u2019s highly \ncapable intelligence services are using human intelligence gathering, cyber, and other \noperations to collect economic information and technology to support its economic \ndevelopment and security. It continues to take information warfare to a new level, \nworking to fan anti-U.S. and anti-Western sentiment both within Russia and globally.  \n \n \nThe most significant human rights problems in Russia in 2015 involved \nrestrictions on the ability to choose one\u2019s government and freedoms of expression, \nassembly, association, and the media, as well as internet freedom; political \nprosecutions and administration of justice; and government discrimination against racial, \nethnic, religious, and sexual minorities. Other problems included allegations of torture \nand excessive force by law enforcement officials; executive branch pressure on the \njudiciary; electoral irregularities; and extensive official corruption. The government failed \nto take steps to prosecute or punish most officials who committed abuses. \n \n \nAlthough Russian law prohibits officials from entering a private residence except \nin cases prescribed by federal law or when authorized by a judicial decision, \ngovernment officials entered residences and premises without warrants. While Russian \nlaw also prohibits government monitoring of correspondence, telephone conversations, \nand other means of communication without a warrant, government officials engaged in \nelectronic surveillance without appropriate authorization.  \n \n \nIn October 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Office of \nthe Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a Joint Statement on Election \nSecurity, stating that the U.S. intelligence community was confident that the Russian \ngovernment directed recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, \nincluding from U.S. political organizations. In December 2016, the DHS, ODNI, and the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation released a Joint Analysis Report stating that activity by \nRussian intelligence services has been part of a decade-long campaign of cyber-\nenabled operations directed at the U.S. Government and its citizens. The campaign \nincluded spear phishing; targeting of government organizations, critical infrastructure, \nthink tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations; theft of information \nfrom these organizations; and the recent public release of some of this stolen \ninformation.  \n\n \n8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n\n \n10 \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant looked at pornography on his work computer from around February \n2014 through February 2015. He estimated at the hearing that he looked at \npornography at work an average of 15 to 30 minutes daily. He did not tell anyone at the \ntime that he was looking at pornography at work because he knew it was improper. \nWhile he denied that he ever mischarged to the government contract any time in which \nhe looked at pornography at work, the investigation conducted by the primary defense \ncontractor concluded that he had. The primary contractor paid $21,577 to the U.S. \nGovernment for Applicant\u2019s mischarged time and his then-employer had to repay the \nmoney to the primary contractor. He acknowledged during his July 2016 background \ninterview that the $20,000 was restitution for an established 100 hours of computer use \nduring work hours for personal purposes. Finally, the letter memorializing his meeting \nwith the debarment officials indicates that he accepted responsibility for mischarging a \ngovernment contract for misspent time. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d), and 16(e) apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct of viewing pornography on his work computer daily from \nFebruary 2014 through February 2015 was a serious offense. He immediately \nacknowledged his conduct once it was discovered through computer monitoring, and he \nthen immediately reported such conduct to his then-employer as well as his current \nemployer. He complied with all requirements imposed on him by his current employer \nand he has not had any other unfavorable issues. He attended SAA meetings, and he \ndisclosed his conduct and consequent termination to his wife.  \n \nApplicant has not, however, taken full responsibility for his conduct. Again, he \ndenied that he ever mischarged the government contract to which he was assigned for \ntime spent viewing pornographic material on his work computer. Yet, the investigation \nconducted by the primary defense contractor concluded that he had. Moreover, the \nletter memorializing his meeting with the debarment officials clearly states that he had \naccepted such responsibility. As such, his reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness \nremain questionable. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are not established. \n \n\n \n11 \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \n \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern for use of information technology:  \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \n \nApplicant looked at pornography on his work computer from around February \n2014 through February 2015. He did not tell anyone at the time that he was looking at \npornography at work because he knew it was improper. AG \u00b6 40(e) applies. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \n \nFor the same reasons set forth above in my Guideline E analysis, I find that AG \u00b6  \n41(a) is not established. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern for foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n\n \n12 \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nRussia, and his father-in-law is a former officer in the Russian military. While Applicant \ntestified that his father-in-law is estranged from the family, his wife talks to her father \nseveral times yearly and she saw him in Russia so that he could meet his grandson. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is close to her mother and brother. She talks to them frequently. She \nvisits them in Russia once yearly, and she most recently traveled to Russia in 2018 for \nher brother\u2019s wedding.  \n \n\n \n13 \n \nRussia is one of the leading state intelligence threats to U.S. interests. It remains \none of the top two most aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive U.S. economic \ninformation and technologies, particularly in cyberspace. Non-cyberspace collection \nmethods include targeting of U.S. visitors overseas, especially if the visitors are \nassessed as having access to sensitive information. It continues to take information \nwarfare to a new level, working to fan anti-U.S. and anti-Western sentiment both within \nRussia and globally. Russian government officials enter private residences and premises \nwithout warrants, and engage in electronic surveillance without appropriate authorization. \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws in Russia create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law and brother-in-law are Russian citizens residing in \nRussia. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the \nabove discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e). Applicant\u2019s wife maintains regular \ncontact with her family in Russia. She also travels to Russia once yearly to visit them. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. \n \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen residing in the United States. He served \nhonorably in the U.S. military from 1990 to 1994. His wife became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in 2014 and renounced her Russian citizenship in 2016. Their children are \nnative-born U.S. citizens. Though Applicant received $90,000 in 2013 from the sale of \nhis mother-in-law\u2019s condominium in Russia, neither he nor his wife have received or \nexpect to receive any additional money from anyone in Russia. Applicant has \nsubstantial financial interests in the United States and neither he nor his wife have any \nsuch interests in Russia. He has complied with security requirements and reported his \nforeign travels and receipt of money from his mother-in-law to his FSO. These are all \n\n \n14 \n \nfactors that weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, his ties to his family in Russia through \nhis wife are also as strong. As such, Applicant has not met his burden of \ndemonstrating that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, M, and B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nI assessed Applicant\u2019s credibility at the hearing. He has not taken responsibility \nfor mischarging a government contract for time spent viewing pornographic material at \nwork. As such, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct, use of information technology, and foreign influence \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n15 \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.c:  \n \n \nAgainst APPLICANT \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant mitigated the \npersonal conduct concerns, but the financial considerations concerns remain. Applicant \nfailed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns and timely pay his income \ntaxes, as required, for seven of the last eight years. He also failed to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 21, 2017, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were \nunable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to a Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for a determination whether to deny \nhis security clearance.  \n1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017.   \n12/28/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. At the hearing, \nconvened on September 10, 2018, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 18 \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, without objection. After the hearing, \nApplicant timely offered AE F through K, which are also admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 19, 2018.   \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nAt the beginning of the hearing, Applicant indicated that he did not remember \nreceiving the October 2017 letter Department Counsel sent to him containing the \ndocuments the Government planned to use in its case against him. Applicant confirmed \nthat the letter and the attached documents were sent to the correct address. Before the \nhearing started, I offered Applicant the opportunity to review the letter and the \nGovernment\u2019s proposed exhibits. After doing so, Applicant confirmed he wanted to \nproceed with the hearing as scheduled.2  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 45, has worked as a security guard with several different federal \ncontracting companies since October 2013. He has worked for his current employer, \nearning approximately $60,000 annually, since December 2014. He completed a \nsecurity clearance application, his first, in March 2015, disclosing a 2012 conviction for \ndriving under the influence of alcohol. The ensuing investigation revealed a more \nextensive criminal record. The investigation also revealed that Applicant failed to file \nfederal and state tax returns for a number of years between 2010 and 2015, and that \nApplicant owes $7,000 on 12 delinquent accounts.3  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s criminal history under the personal conduct \nguideline. Applicant\u2019s first arrest for unlawful use of a vehicle, occurred in 1990 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a). He was among a group of people participating in a carpool. Neither he nor the \nother passengers were aware that the driver did not have permission to use the car. He \nwas released without being charged. He was arrested again in 1992 for felony assault \non a police officer (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant testified that he and his friends intervened in a \ndomestic dispute they witnessed on a public basketball court. When the police arrived, \nApplicant was one of several people arrested. He denies assaulting a police officer. The \ncharges were dismissed.  In 2011, Applicant was charged with domestic violence after \nan incident involving his son, who was 20 at the time (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The young man was \nintoxicated and started hitting his 18-year-old sister. Applicant intervened. Although he \nwas arrested, Applicant testified that he was released without charges. Applicant was \ncharged in March 2013 for driving with a suspended license (SOR \u00b6 1.i) and in \nNovember 2013 for driving on a revoked license (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant testified that he \n                                                          \n2 Tr. 5-6; HE I. \n \n3 Tr. 42-45; GE 1-3, 5-16. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nwas unaware of the status of his license in March 2013 and that the November 2013 \nincident was the result of an administrative mistake. Both charges were nolle prossed.4  \n \nApplicant admits being arrested multiple times for alcohol-related incidents. He \nwas arrested in 1996 and 1998 for DUI (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 d). The dispositions of these \ncharges is not in the record. In 2009 and 2012, Applicant was charged with driving while \nimpaired by alcohol (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h) He was convicted both times. He received \nprobation before judgment for the 2009 incident and served seven days in jail for the \n2012 incident. At hearing, Applicant admitted that he had an alcohol problem. However, \nhe realized that his alcohol consumption habits were incompatible with his work as a \nsecurity officer. He has abstained from alcohol since 2014.5  \n \nThe SOR also alleges a series of financial issues, specifically that Applicant \nfailed to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2010 through 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b).  However, based on wage and income transcripts in the record for 2010 \nthrough 2012, Applicant was not required to file federal or state income tax returns for \n2012. Although he testified that his 2013 income did not meet the minimum filing \nrequirement, he did not provide any corroborating documentation. Applicant explained \nthat he failed to file his federal and state income tax returns because \u201ctime got away \nfrom him.\u201d  He filed his 2011, 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in September \n2017, but did not pay the additional taxes owed. He testified that his outstanding state \nincome tax returns were prepared, but he did not know if they had been filed. At hearing \nhe admitted that he also failed to file his 2016 and 2017 federal and state income tax \nreturns.6 \n \nBelieving he owed outstanding federal taxes, Applicant testified that he intended \nto hire a law firm to help him negotiate with the IRS to pay a reduced amount. However, \nin his post-hearing submissions, he provided an installment agreement with the IRS \nfiled in October 2018 to pay $11,048 in outstanding federal taxes for the 2011 and the  \n2014 through 2017 tax years. The installment plan, which requires $400 monthly \ninstallment, begins in December 2018. Applicant did not provide any additional \ninformation about the status of his outstanding state income tax returns. Applicant is \nalso in debt to the state for $1,064 (SOR \u00b6 2.c) for an outstanding judgment. He claims \nthe judgment had been paid, but did not provide any corroborating documentation.7 \n \nIn addition to his outstanding income tax obligations, the SOR also alleges that \nApplicant owes $7,000 for 12 delinquent accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d through 2.n). Applicant \nadmits that he owes the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d through 2.i. In his answer, he \nclaimed that the debts were consolidated with a debt repayment program. At the \nhearing, Applicant testified that he signed up for the program, but did not execute a \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 24-29; GE 3, 5, 8-9. \n \n5 Tr. 24-25, 30-32; GE 6-7.  \n \n6 Tr. 32-39, 46; Answer; AE A-E. \n \n7 Tr. 33, 39-40, 47; GE 10; AE G-H. \n\n \n4 \n \nrepayment plan. He provided documentation that he has made arrangements to resolve \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, the deficiency balance on an automobile loan. He plans to work additional \nhours to pay the $1,226 debt. Applicant denies owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j \nthrough 1.n as he is not familiar with the accounts. He believes that the debts may be \nattributed to identify theft. He did not provide any documentation to establish that he \nfiled an identity theft complaint or that he challenged the debts in question with the \ncredit reporting agencies. The alleged delinquent accounts remain unresolved.8 \n \nCurrently, Applicant provides the only source of income for his household, which \nincludes his partner and their four children, ages 27, 25, 21, and 15. After paying his \nrecurring bills, Applicant has approximately $200 in disposable income each month. He \nhopes his partner, who has been unemployed since April 2018, is able to secure \nemployment in the near future.9  \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n                                                          \n8 Tr. 40-42, 48-49; GE 2, 11-16; AE I-J. \n \n9 Tr. 45-52. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The \nSOR alleges Applicant\u2019s criminal history, 10 charges, including 2 convictions, between \n1990 and 2012. This adverse information raises concerns under the criminal conduct \nand alcohol consumption guidelines, but given the passage of time, the alleged \nincidents are insufficient for an adverse determination under either rubric. However, \nwhen considered as a whole, the incidents support a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with relies and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.10 However, the record \ncontains sufficient evidence to mitigate the personal conduct concerns.  \n \n \nOf the 10 alleged arrests, 5 are minor incidents (1.a, 1.b, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j) that do not \nreflect negatively on Applicant\u2019s security worthiness.11 While he was involved in the \nincidents alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g, he was not the instigator or primary actor. \nWhile the traffic violations alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j could suggest a disregard for \nthe laws, rules, and regulations, it appears that SOR 1.i was unintentional and \u00b6 1.j was \nthe result of an administrative snafu. However, the remaining five incidents, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \n- 1.f, and 1.h, all involving driving under the influence of alcohol, raise concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption and its impact on his judgment. His multiple instances \nof driving under the influence of alcohol also shows a disregard for laws, rules, and \nregulations. However, these incidents are mitigated by the passage of time.12 \n                                                          \n10 AG \u00b6 16(c). \n \n11 AG \u00b6 17(c). \n \n12 AG \u00b6 17(d).  \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident occurred over six years ago. Since then, he has \nacknowledged his alcohol problem and recognized his behavior was incompatible with \nhis professional responsibilities and duties. He has abstained from alcohol for four \nyears, making recurrence of similar criminal conduct unlikely.13 \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.14 The SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal and \nstate income tax returns for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 and that he has \napproximately $7,000 in unresolved delinquent debts. The record is sufficient to \nestablish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant has a history of not meeting \nhis financial obligations, and that he has failed to timely file his federal and state income \nreturns, as required.15   \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file was caused by his own negligence and remains an \nongoing problem. He failed to produce evidence that his outstanding federal and state \nincome returns have been filed. His post-hearing efforts to establish an installment \nagreement with the IRS is not sufficient to establish that his tax problems are remedied \nor under control. Applicant also failed to establish a record of debt repayment or that he \nhas filed disputes with the credit reporting agencies to challenge the accounts he \nbelieves are the result of identity theft. The delinquent debts alleged in the SOR remain \nunresolved and he does not have a plan to resolve them.  \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s ongoing suitability for \naccess to classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the \nwhole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant takes his position as a security guard \nseriously and his role has helped him mature and grow into a more responsible adult. \nHowever, he has not done enough to establish financial rehabilitation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n13 AG \u00b6 17(d). \n \n14 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n15 AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and (f).  \n  \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of Case\nOn December 21, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, denied, or revoked. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) implemented by the DOD\non September 1, 2006. \n01/17/2019\n\nThe Director of National Intelligence, by Security Executive Agent, Directive 4,\nApp. A, National security Adjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4), dated December 10, 2016,\nsuperceded and replaced the September 2006 adjudicative guidelines (AGs).  They apply\nto all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified\ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. Procedures for administrative due\nprocess for contractor personnel continue to be governed by DOD Directive 5220.6,\nsubject to the updated substantive changes in the AGs, effective June 8, 2017.\nApplication of the AGs that were in effect when the SOR was issued would not affect my\ndecision in this case.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 23, 2018, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 20, 2018, and scheduled for hearing on June 6,\n2018. The Government\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits  (GEs 1-4) that were admitted\nwithout objection. Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and three exhibits that were\nadmitted without objection as AEs A-C. The transcript was received on June 14, 2018.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documented installment\nagreements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and resident state taxing authority,\ntogether with federal and state transcripts for tax years 1999-2015. \nFor good cause shown, Applicant was granted 30 days to supplement the record.\nDepartment Counsel was afforded seven days to respond. Applicant did not supplement\nthe record. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) is indebted on a judgment filed against\nhim in August 2016 in the approximate amount of $2,401; (b) is indebted to the IRS for a\ntax lien entered against him in May 2011 for $453,709; (c) is indebted to his state of\nresidence for a tax lien entered against him in November 2010 in the approximate amount\nof $7,724; (d) is indebted to his state of residence for a tax lien entered against him in\nJune 2007 in the approximate amount of $27,238; (e) is indebted to his state of residence\nfor a tax lien entered against him in May 2007 in the approximate amount of $12,453; (f)\nin indebted to a consumer creditor for an amount placed in collection in the approximate\namount of $1,943; (g) failed to file his federal tax returns for tax years 1999 through 2015;\nand (h) failed to file his state tax returns for tax years 1999 through 2015.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR. He\nclaimed no knowledge of the judgment covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a. He claimed he engaged\ncounsel and a certified public accountant (CPA) to prepare his tax returns, file them, and\nto negotiate a payment plan to repay any unpaid taxes.  And he claimed no knowledge of\nthe alleged delinquent debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.f.\n.\n2\n\nFinding   s   of Fact\nApplicant is a 54-year-old project coordinator for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR were not admitted by Applicant\nand are reserved for fact-finding based on the developed evidence at hearing. \nBackground\nApplicant married in April 1988 and has three children from this marriage. H\nearned a high school diploma in May 2003, but did not report any post-high school\neducation credits. (GE 1) Applicant reported no military service.\nSince August 2015, Applicant has been employed by his current defense\ncontractor. (GEs 1-2) Between January 1994 and August 2010, he was self-employed.\nAnd between August 2010 and August 2015, he was employed by various non-DOD\ncontractors in various job assignments, interspersed with periods of unemployment. (GEs\n1-2)\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nBetween 1999 and 2015, Applicant failed to file his federal and state of residence\nincome tax returns, as required by law. (GEs 1-2) He attributed his filing failures to\nnational disasters, filing delays by his lawyers, poor cash flow from his self-employed\nbusiness, and caring for a relative stricken with cancer. (Tr. 23-27, 69) While he claims to\nhave filed his federal and state returns for tax years 1999-2015 in 2017 (AE C; Tr. 36), he\nprovided no independent corroboration and substantiation of his filing claims, despite\nafforded post-hearing opportunities to do so.\nFor years 1999-2015, Applicant accrued delinquent federal and state taxes.\nAccrued federal taxes for these years are covered by a federal tax lien filed in May 2011\nfor $453,709. (GEs 2-4 and AE C; Tr. 37-38) While Applicant claims to have resolved this\ntax lien through a combination of payments and refunds, to date, he has provided no\ndocumentation to verify his claims, and it remains unresolved and outstanding. (AE C; Tr.\n36)  Credit reports also document state tax liens entered against Applicant in November\n2010 for $7,724 and in May 2007 for $12,453. (GEs 2-4 and AE C; Tr. 19, 22)\nBesides his tax debts, credit reports document Applicant\u2019s accruing a judgment\nagainst him in August 2016 for $2,401, as well as a delinquent insurance debt in the\namount of $1,943. (GEs 2-4) To date, these no-tax debts remain unresolved and\noutstanding. \nIn an effort to address his delinquent tax and consumer debts, Applicant petitioned\nfor Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in March 2018. (AEs A-C) In his petition, he listed assets\nof $91,801 and liabilities of $584,835. (AE C; Tr. 40) He listed several claims in his\npetition as follows: a priority unsecured IRS tax lien of $453,709 filed in May 2011 and an\nunsecured priority vendor\u2019s lien of $175,000 filed in March 2015. (AE C) Applicant listed\n3\n\nunsecured non-priority state tax liens in his petition totaling $10,125. (AE C; Tr. 40) He \nlisted unsecured non-priority state tax liens in his petition totaling $10,125, an aggregate\nof tax liens at odds with the $47,415 figure reported in his credit reports. (AE C)\nConceivably, the lower figure represents a reduction of state taxes owed due to payments\nmade and refund offsets. (AE C; Tr. 22) Without state tax transcripts or other reliable data\nsummaries to track his payments and credits, no reliable inferences can be drawn as to\nthe state of his account balance with this state.\nIn April 2018, the presiding bankruptcy court in Applicant\u2019s state of residence,\nconfirmed Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 plan. (AE A; Tr. 42) Under the terms of Applicant\u2019s plan,\nthe court imposed payment conditions of $2,396 monthly payments to the trustee for the\nremaining term of the plan. (AE A) Scheduled monthly payments were to commence 30\ndays from the date of Applicant\u2019s March 2018 petition filing and continue for the duration\nof the plan. (AEs A-C) Payment allocations were set as follows: $1,250 to the vendor lien\nholder; $300 to the IRS; and $1,026 to the tax lien holder of Applicant\u2019s state of\nresidence. (AEs A-C)\nWhether Applicant has maintained compliance with his Chapter 13 payment terms\nis unclear, for he has not provided any payment documentation, either at hearing, or\nduring the time reserved for post-hearing updates. (AEs A-C; Tr. 43, 58-60) Further, his\nclaims of additional payments to the IRS on its $453,709 tax lien, in addition to his\npayments to the chapter 13 trustee, are neither corroborated nor substantiated. (Tr. 39-\n40, 49-50)\nTo date, Applicant has not provided any federal or state transcripts to verify his tax\nfilings, dates thereof, and evidence of any past payments made (voluntarily or\ninvoluntarily) for tax years 1999-2015.  Because Applicant has not provided any federal or\nstate tax transcripts, tax returns, or payment history for tax years 1999-2015, his filing and\npayment claims cannot be validated. And, without IRS and state taxing  agency approvals\nof his tax filings and payment plans, his Chapter 13 payment plan cannot be determined\nto meet federal and state filing and payment requirements for Chapter 13 discharge.\nCurrently, Applicant nets $5,633 a month on average; while his wife nets\napproximately $2,730 a month. (AE C; Tr. 43-45) Payroll deductions total $4,088 for\nhimself and $1,985 for his wife. (AE C) Reported monthly expenses are $3,466 for both of\nthem. (AE C) \nApplicant reported a monthly remainder of $2,607. (AE C; Tr. 45-46).  He has an\nIRA retirement account with approximately $12,000 in the account. (Tr. 47) He reported\nexempt property of $18,000. (AE C)\n. \nPolicies\n                \n       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into\naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,\n4\n\nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and\nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to\nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG\n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\n       The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can\nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of,\nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,\nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of\ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to\ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\n5\n\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and\nstate tax returns for tax years 1999-2015, accrual of federal and state tax liens covering\ndelinquent taxes exceeding $500,000, and two delinquent non-tax debts (a judgment\nentered in August 2016 for $2,401) and an insurance debts for $1,943). These concerns\nover tax filing and debt delinquencies raise questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment and\nreliability to safely and prudently manage his finances. \nFinancial Concerns\n      Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for multiple\nyears (1999-2015) and his incurring of delinquent federal and state tax liens and non-\n6\n\ntax debts for the years at issue warrant the application of four disqualifying conditions\n(DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b); unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local\nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as\nrequired.\u201d\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that\nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security\nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt\ndelinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of filing federal tax returns and resolving federal and state\ntax delinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness,\nreliability, and good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those\nseeking access to classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR\nCase No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App.\nBd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited extenuating circumstances (i.e., national disasters,\npoor cash flow, caring for a relative with diagnosed cancer, and lawyer delays) and\ninsufficient income to pay his accrued federal and state taxes and other non-tax debts\nwhen due and payable. His claims without more probative evidence to corroborate and\nsubstantiate them are not enough to credit him with justifiable extenuation and \nmitigation.  \nTo date, Applicant has provided no persuasive justification for his failure to timely\nfile his federal and state tax returns, address his federal and state taxes due for the tax\nyears 1999-2015, and provide evidence of his addressing his reported judgment and\ninsurance debts with documented payments and payment plans.  Based on Applicant\u2019s \ncited circumstances, Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to corroborate and substantiate his \ntax filing and payment claims and demonstrate a good track record of compliance with\nthe terms of his Chapter 13 petition and any payment arrangements he may have with\nthe IRS and state taxing agency of his state and non-tax creditors listed in the SOR\npreclude him from fully availing himself of the benefits of either MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances\u201d: MC  \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d; or MC  \u00b6 20(c)\n\u201cthe individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a\nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit counseling service, and there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d See ISCR Case\nNo. 15-06440 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App.\nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005). \n7\n\nAnd, because Applicant\u2019s tax filing and debt issues continue to be considered\nrecent for so long as they remain unresolved, he may not avail himself of the mitigating\nbenefits of MC \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d See ISCR\nCase No. 15\u201306532 at 3( App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017)(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2\n(App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016). \nWhether Applicant is entitled to the full mitigating benefits of MC \u00b6 20(g), \u201cthe\nindividual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the\namount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements,\u201d is unclear at this point.\nSee ISCR Case No. 16-02246, at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, 2017). Applicant provided no\ndocumentation at hearing or in permitted post-hearing submissions of any completed\ninstallment agreements with the IRS and state taxing agency, much less evidence of\ncompliance with those agreements.\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely filing of tax\nreturns. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) And, in a consistent\nline of decisions, the Appeal Board has questioned the value of bankruptcy petitions\ninitiated after the issuance of an SOR to demonstrate restored financial responsibility\nand sound judgment. See ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 1918 (citing\nISCR Case No. 15-00682 at 3 (App. Bd. July 13, 2016)).\nIn Applicant\u2019s case, his failure or inability to provide documentary proof of his\nfiling federal and state income tax returns for tax years 1999-2015, addressing his owed\nfederal and state taxes, and paying or otherwise resolving his two delinquent non-tax-\nrelated debts of record before the initiation of the security clearance process precludes\nhim from meeting his evidentiary burden with respect to raised security concerns about\nthe condition of his finances. More effort and results could be reasonably expected of\nApplicant in taking the necessary steps to restore his finances to stable levels\nconsistent with eligibility criteria for holding a security clearance.\nWhole-Person Assessment\nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. He has shown insufficient \nprogress to date in filing his federal and state income tax returns over a period of\nmultiple years and addressing his delinquent federal and state tax liens and non-tax\ndebts. While Applicant\u2019s general contributions to the U.S. defense effort through his\ncurrent employer are recognized and merit respect and appreciation, his credits are\ninsufficient o surmount historical trust and judgment issues associated with his failure to\ntimely file his federal and state income tax returns over the course of many years  and\nfailure to better address his major tax and non-tax delinquencies.\nOverall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing his finances reflect too little\nevidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to overcome reasonable\n8\n\ndoubts about his trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect classified information\nor occupy a sensitive position.

Petcher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Esq. \n03/12/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant was indicted by a grand jury in May 2013 on 12 counts of sexual criminal \nconduct allegedly committed against his underage stepdaughter between July 2009 and \nFebruary 2013, including four counts of aggravated rape of a child. Applicant denied any \nculpability, and in March 2015, the state declined further prosecution. There is reliable \nevidence that Applicant committed sex crimes. His failure to timely report his arrest to his \nemployer also raises significant concerns about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 8, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline J (criminal conduct), Guideline E (personal conduct), and Guideline D \n(sexual behavior). The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for \nhim. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n\n2 \n \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR through his counsel on July 27, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). On January 9, 2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct a \nhearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. On January 15, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for \nFebruary 12, 2019.  \n \nAt the hearing, six Government exhibits (GEs 1-6) were admitted in evidence. An \nAugust 13, 2018 letter forwarding discovery of the GEs to Applicant\u2019s counsel and a list of \nthe GEs were marked as hearing exhibits (HEs I-II) but not admitted as evidentiary exhibits. \nFive Applicant exhibits (AEs A-E) were admitted in evidence, and Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 27, 2019. \n \nI held the record open for two weeks after the hearing for Applicant to present a \ndeclaration from the attorney who represented him in defense of the felony charges. On \nFebruary 14, 2019, Applicant submitted a declaration (AE F), which was accepted into \nevidence without any objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.b) and cross alleges under \nGuideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.d) and Guideline D (SOR \u00b6 3.a) that Applicant was arrested on \nFebruary 23, 2013, on three counts of rape of a child and one count of witness intimidation \nand that he was indicted on May 29, 2013, on four counts of aggravated rape of a child, six \ncounts of indecent assault and battery on a child under age 14, one count of assault and \nbattery with intent to rape, and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous \nweapon. Under Guideline E, Applicant is also alleged to have failed to timely report his \narrest to his facility security officer (FSO) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and to have lied on his May 7, 2015 \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and during his July 12, \n2015 subject interview with a government investigator (SOR \u00b6 2.c) by stating that he was \nfalsely accused of the criminal conduct allegations. \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I find that Applicant\u2019s arrest \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a is related to the charges in SOR \u00b6 1.b and does not represent an allegation of \nadditional criminal conduct. Additional findings of fact follow. \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old senior test engineer with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical \nengineering awarded in May 2005. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since May 2004, and was granted a DOD secret clearance in June 2005. His \nsecurity clearance eligibility was suspended in February 2013 after he was arrested on \nrape charges. (GE 1; AEs D-E; Tr. 23-24.) \n\n3 \n \nApplicant and his now ex-wife married in July 2006, when their daughter was age 2 \nand her daughter from a previous relationship was about to turn age 6. They had a son in \nMarch 2008. Applicant and his ex-wife separated permanently in late February 2013 after \nhis arrest on charges of raping his stepdaughter. (GE 1.) His ex-wife filed for divorce in \n2013, and their divorce was final in January 2017.1 (GE 2.) \n \nOn February 28, 2013, Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter, then 12-years-old, told her mother \nthat Applicant had sexually assaulted her on eight to ten occasions in their home, to as \nrecently as only five days prior. She described incidents of sexual penetration (rape) and \nthreats from Applicant to beat her with a belt if she told anyone about the assaults. \nApplicant\u2019s now ex-wife called the police, who, on responding, noticed that Applicant\u2019s \nstepdaughter appeared visibly upset. Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter reportedly had red and \nswollen eyes from crying, a flushed face, and hunched posture so that she appeared to be \nhunched in on herself. The police did not interview the girl at that time, but they obtained \nan account from Applicant\u2019s ex-wife of what her daughter had told her about the assaults. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife told the police that her daughter has a close relationship with Applicant, \nwhom she regarded as her father. The police arrested Applicant for rape of a child with \nforce and with intimidation of a witness for an offense that allegedly occurred on February \n23, 2013, and for two counts of rape of a child with force for offenses that reportedly \noccurred between July 1, 2012, and February 23, 2013. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife obtained an \nemergency restraining order against him, and a report was filed with the Department of \nChildren and Families (DCF). (GE 5.) Applicant was in custody for a week after his arrest. \n(Tr. 26.) \n \nAvailable police records show that the police interviewed a friend of Applicant\u2019s \nstepdaughter, who had been identified as one of the first people she had told about the \nsexual assaults. According to this friend, who was then 13 years old and a close \nclassmate, Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter related to her that she had been abused by Applicant \nfor a while, and she feared for her half-sister\u2019s safety. Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter was crying, \nshaking, and speaking with a voice that was cracking when she told the friend about the \nassaults. (GE 5.) \n \nOn May 29, 2013, a grand jury indicted Applicant on twelve felony counts for crimes \nallegedly committed by him on his stepdaughter on diverse dates between July 20, 2009, \nand February 2013, to wit: aggravated rape of a child (four counts); assault with a \ndangerous weapon (a belt) (one count); indecent assault and battery on a child under age \n14 (six counts); and assault to rape a child (one count). (GE 4.) On June 19, 2013, \nApplicant advised his security office at work that he had been arrested and charged with \nthree counts of forcible rape on a child and \u201cwitness/juror/police/court office intimidation on \nFebruary 28, 2013.2 The security office issued an adverse incident report to DOHA on June \n                                                 \n1 Applicant testified at his hearing that his ex-wife filed for divorce in 2014, about a year after he was accused \nof raping his stepdaughter. (Tr. 35.) However, he indicated during his subject interview in July 2016 that his ex-\nwife filed shortly after his arrest. (GE 2.) \n \n2 Applicant testified discrepantly at this hearing that there was a delay of \u201ca couple of months\u201d in him reporting \nhis arrest. (Tr. 27-28, 46.) \n\n4 \n \n19, 2013, of Applicant\u2019s arrest, stating in part: \u201c[Applicant] failed to report the exact charges \nto security and also admitted to \u2018being scared\u2019 as a reason for not reporting it sooner.\u201d (GE \n3.) Applicant testified at his February 2019 security clearance hearing that he reported his \narrests to his supervisor, who walked him to their security office. (Tr. 47.) When asked why \nhe delayed reporting his arrest to his security officials, Applicant denied that he was \nscared. He maintained that he was stressed, but primarily focused on taking care of his \nfamily. (Tr. 27-28, 51.) He understood at the time that he was required to report his arrest \nwhen it happened. (Tr. 46.) \n \nApplicant entered pleas of not guilty to the 12 felony counts at his arraignment on \nJune 24, 2013. (GE 6.) On August 12, 2013, the state filed with the trial court a statement \nof the case in which it summarized that Applicant abused the victim from when she was \nnine years old; that the abuse progressed from fondling to rape; that Applicant threatened \nto beat the victim with a belt if she told anyone; that he had beaten her with a belt in the \npast; that the victim first disclosed the abuse to her friends from school; that when the \nvictim told her mother about the abuse, her mother called the police immediately; that \nApplicant was arrested in the family home that evening; that Applicant declined to make a \nstatement to the police; and that a grand jury indictment was returned against Applicant on \n12 counts on May 29, 2013. (GE 5.) \n \nThe attorney who represented Applicant during protracted proceedings in Superior \nCourt attests that the prosecutor offered plea bargains, which included a reduction in \nconfinement for Applicant and disposition of some allegations in return for a guilty plea. \nApplicant gave him clear instructions to reject any offers and prepare for trial. According to \nthe attorney, there was no scientific evidence linking Applicant to the crimes. (AE F.) A jury \ntrial was scheduled and then rescheduled several times to March 2, 2015. On February 26, \n2015, the state moved for a nolle prosequi on all of the charges at that time. After meeting \nwith the victim several times for the purposes of trial preparation, the state did not believe it \ncould meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. In addition, the state did \nnot believe it was in the victim\u2019s best interest to proceed at that time. (GE 5.) On March 3, \n2015, the state filed statements of nolle prosequi as to each of the 12 counts. (GE 6; AE \nA.) \n \nOn May 7, 2015, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to police record \ninquiries, Applicant listed only two charges, of sexual abuse and domestic violence, and \nstated: \n \nOn February 28, 2013, I was FALSELY accused of sexual abuse against my \nstepchild. Due to this, a restraining order was obtained by my wife. After an \nintensive investigation, on March 3, 2015, the [state name] declared a Nolle \nProsequi due to NO evidence and inconsistent stories by the accuser. \n \n \nApplicant responded affirmatively to whether there was currently a domestic \nviolence protective order or restraining order against him. He explained that a restraining \norder was issued against him on February 28, 2013, after he had been \u201cFALSELY accused \n\n5 \n \nof sexual abuse against [his] stepchild.\u201d He added that his wife obtained a temporary \nrestraining order against him to prevent him from seeing his children, but on May 19, 2015, \nthe family court will grant him visitation times and joint custody of his children. Applicant \nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to whether his security clearance eligibility had ever been denied, \nsuspended, or revoked and disclosed that the DOD suspended his Secret clearance in \napproximately August 2014 pending resolution of the criminal sexual assault charges. (GE \n1.) \n \n \nOn July 12, 2016, Applicant was interviewed at work by an authorized investigator \nfor the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that he and his spouse \nseparated because of the February 2013 allegations made against him, and that she filed \nfor divorce shortly after the allegations were made. He expected their divorce to be final on \nJuly 20, 2016; that he would be required to pay $370 per week in child support for his two \nchildren;3 and that  he will have unsupervised visitation with his children on Tuesdays and \nSundays. About the February 2013 criminal allegations, Applicant explained that the police \ncame to his house about 30 minutes after he had returned home from work; that he was \nplaced under arrest on alleged sexual abuse charges; that he had declined to provide a \nstatement to the police without an attorney present; that he was jailed for a few days until \nhis sister posted $50,000 bail for him; and that he was required to wear a GPS monitor and \nstay away from his marital residence as a condition of his bail. He indicated that in May \n2013, he found out that he was being indicted on five counts of sexual assault and one \ncount of intimidation of a witness. He was required to report to a probation officer once a \nweek from May 2013 to March 2015. Applicant explained that the charges were nolle \nprosequi without ever going to trial because there was not enough evidence to prosecute \nhim. He stated that despite the \u201cdismissal\u201d of the charges in March 2015, the restraining \norder against him was not removed until December 2015. (GE 2; AE C.) \n \n \nAfter being reminded by the OPM investigator that he was under oath and under the \npenalties for intentional misrepresentation or false statements set forth in Section 1001 of \nTitle 18 of the United States Code, Applicant denied ever touching his children \ninappropriately and indicated that the allegations against him were false. He stated that he \nwas unsure why his stepdaughter would fabricate these allegations against him, and \nasserted that there was no truth to them. He added that people who know him are \nsurprised by the allegations, and that the only person who disbelieves Applicant is his \nspouse. He could provide no reason why his wife sided with his stepdaughter other than \nthat the girl is her daughter. When asked about his delay in reporting his arrest, he \nindicated that he was trying to get his personal life in order, which was more important to \nhim at that time. He denied the delay was because he feared he might lose his job. He \ndenied that his arrest or the February 2013 allegations could be used against him because \nnothing happened. (GE 2; AE C.) \n \n  \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on January 29, 2018, that \nalthough he and his ex-wife were officially divorced in January 2017, they \u201chave a healthy \nco-parenting and thoughtful parenting plan to ensure that [their] children have a happy, \n                                                 \n3 On September 18, 2015, an adverse incident report was filed by Applicant\u2019s employer noting that Applicant\u2019s \nwages were garnished in August 2015 for child support of almost $2,015. (GE 3.) \n\n6 \n \nhealthy, stable, and balance[d] life.\u201d (GE 2.) At his hearing held in February 2019, Applicant \nindicated that he has unsupervised contact with his two children three days a week. (Tr. \n25.) He provided a \u201cbiography\u201d (AE E) in which he stated in part: \n \nUnfortunately, due to false allegations, our family had to struggle through \ntough times. Now, even though we are divorced, we are closer than ever and \nwe are successfully co-parenting our children. We are working together for a \nbrighter future for all of us. \n \n \nApplicant denies any truth to any of the sexual assault crimes alleged against him by \nhis stepdaughter or any tampering with a witness. (Tr. 29-33.) He had no explanation for \nwhy his ex-wife filed for divorce, although he assumed it was \u201cbased on the false \nallegations.\u201d Applicant claims he had an \u201cexcellent\u201d relationship with his ex-wife at the time, \nand he does not know why his ex-wife believes that he raped her daughter. (Tr. 36, 50.) \nApplicant acknowledged that he has no visitation rights to see his stepdaughter, with whom \nhe claimed he had a wonderful relationship before she accused him of the crimes. He \ncould provide no reason why his stepdaughter would falsely accuse him. (Tr. 50-52.) \n \n \nApplicant presented no statements from his ex-wife, other family members, co-\nworkers, or friends. He provided his annual performance evaluations for 2009 through \n2017, which detail his contributions to his defense-contractor employer. Applicant has \nconsistently met, and since 2012 exceeded, his work requirements while needing minimal \nsupervision. Detailed-oriented and a team player, Applicant has displayed a positive \nattitude and extreme flexibility in fulfilling work assignments. He has worked extra hours, \nincluding on weekends, to support program schedules. Applicant delivered \u201csuperior results \nin 2015.\u201d In 2016, he supported a very active test area. He was considered to be a valuable \nasset to the test engineering organization. By 2017, he had become the \u201cgo to guy\u201d and a \nsubject matter expert as it related to high power testing. He was given an overall rating of \n\u201cHighly Effective Contribution\u201d for 2017. (AE B.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n\n7 \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nunwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nIn May 2013, Applicant was indicted by a grand jury on twelve felony counts for \ncrimes allegedly committed by him on his stepdaughter on diverse dates between July 20, \n2009, and February 2013, to wit: aggravated rape of a child (four counts); assault with a \ndangerous weapon (a belt) (one count); indecent assault and battery on a child under age \n\n8 \n \n14 (six counts); and assault to rape a child (one count). The indictment indicates the grand \njury believed Applicant committed felonious sexual assaults on his stepdaughter between \n2009 and February 2018 and that he threatened to assault her if she told anyone about the \nassaults.4  \n \n \nA grand jury is afforded a wide latitude to inquire into violations of criminal law. It \nmay compel the production of evidence or the testimony of witnesses as it considers \nappropriate without restraint by the technical procedural and evidentiary rules governing \ncriminal trials. The evidentiary standard for a grand jury indictment is probable cause to \nbelieve the defendant committed the offense. United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 \nU.S. 418 at 423 (1983). Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances are \nreasonably trustworthy and \u201csufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable \ncaution in his belief that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d Brinegar v. United \nStates, 338 U.S. 160, 176 (1949).5 Probable cause does not require a finding that a fact be \nmore likely true than false. See Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742 (1983). In the state at \nissue, probable cause requires more than mere suspicion but something less than \nevidence sufficient to warrant a conviction. See Commonwealth v. Hason, 439 N.E. 2d 251, \n255 (1982). Moreover, the state\u2019s criminal procedure rules (Rule 4(c)) re-affirm a long-\nrecognized rule in the state that evidence which is not legally competent at trial may be \nsufficient for an indictment and an indictment based exclusively on hearsay will not be \ninvalidated at trial for that reason. \n \n  \nGiven Applicant denies any validity to the alleged crimes, the burden is on the \nGovernment of establishing the criminal behavior alleged in the SOR. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. The Government is not required to establish Applicant\u2019s culpability beyond a \nreasonable doubt. Security clearance proceedings employ the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d \nevidentiary standard, which is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). Substantial evidence is \n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion.\u201d Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971). See ISCR Case No. 15-\n05049 at 4 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017) (\u201cA Judge\u2019s material findings must be based on \nsubstantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be \ndrawn from the evidence.\u201d) (citing ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. July 25, 2014)). \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence includes police reports containing contemporaneous \nsummaries of interviews of Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and a close friend of Applicant\u2019s \nstepdaughter about the sexual assaults as detailed to them by Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter. \nAlthough hearsay in nature, their accounts cannot be dismissed outright as unreliable. \nThere is no apparent motive for either of them to have made false statements to the police \nabout what they were told. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife is unlikely to have pressured her daughter to \n                                                 \n4 The state\u2019s rules of criminal procedure may be accessed at www.mass.gov. Under Rule 5 concerning grand \njuries, an indictment may be found only upon the concurrence of 12 or more jurors. \n \n5 There is probable cause to indict a suspect \u201cif there is sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the \naccused, and probable cause to arrest him or her.\u201d  Commonwealth v. Caracciola, 409 Mass. 648, 650, 569 \nN.E.2d 774 (1991).  \n \n\n9 \n \nlie if she had as close a relationship with Applicant as he claims. Applicant presented no \nevidence that a classmate of Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter had anything to gain by lying to the \npolice. There is no statement in evidence from Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter, but the grand jury \nindictment and the statements to the police from her mother and friend constitute \nprobative, reliable evidence that may be considered in these proceedings, and together \nraise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31(b). \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s case for mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(c) is that there is \u201cno reliable evidence \nto support that the individual committed the offense.\u201d It relies on his denials of culpability \nand on the nolle prosequi of the charges. The state\u2019s declination to continue prosecution \nonly days before Applicant\u2019s scheduled trial was based on the best interests of the \nstepdaughter, but also because the state did not think that it could prove the charges \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The state provides for dismissal of charges by the \nprosecution.6  Under rule 16(b) of its criminal procedure rules, the entry of nolle prosequi to \neach of the 12 counts is not the equivalent of an acquittal, unless jeopardy has attached. \nJeopardy does not attach before trial has commenced.7 There is no evidence that the \nintegrity of the grand jury was impaired, and it required more than mere suspicion to indict \nApplicant. The exercise of the prosecution\u2019s discretionary authority to decline further \nprosecution in this case is not a finding of no culpability. The district attorney could bring \nnew charges at some future date, although given it has been more than four years with no \nevidence of any action, there appears to be little likelihood new charges would be brought \nwithout some new incriminating evidence.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision not to accept a plea bargain also does not prove his innocence. \nHe faced possible incarceration for a minimum of ten years had he been convicted of \naggravated rape of his stepdaughter,8 and he may have chosen to proceed to trial \n                                                 \n6 Criminal Procedure Rule 16(a) provides: \n \n(a) A prosecuting attorney may enter a nolle prosequi of pending charges at any time prior to \nthe pronouncement of sentence. A nolle prosequi shall be accompanied by a written \nstatement, signed by the prosecuting attorney, setting forth the reasons for that disposition. \n \n7 See Commonwealth v. Massod, 350 Mass. 745 (1966). \n \n8 Section 23A of Chapter 265 of the state\u2019s general laws makes aggravated rape punishable as follows: \n \nSection 23A. Whoever unlawfully has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse, and \nabuses a child under 16 years of age and: \n \n(a) there exists more than a 5 year age difference between the defendant and the victim and \nthe victim is under 12 years of age; \n \n(b) there exists more than a 10 year age difference between the defendant and the victim \nwhere the victim is between the age of 12 and 16 years of age; or \n \n(c) at the time of such intercourse, was a mandated reporter as defined in section 21 of \nchapter 119, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of \nyears, but not less than 10 years. The sentence imposed on such person shall not be \nreduced to less than 10 years, or suspended, nor shall any person convicted under this \nsection be eligible for probation, parole, work release, or furlough or receive any deduction \n\n10 \n \ncalculating that the evidence was not strong enough to convict him. He was zealously \nrepresented in the criminal proceedings, and he had discovery of the prosecution\u2019s case. \nHis attorney indicates that there was no scientific evidence linking Applicant to the crime. \nHowever, this statement does not establish that there was no physical evidence of injury to \nthe victim. \n \n \nApplicant demonstrated a lack of candor about the criminal charges and his family \nrelationships during the investigation and adjudication of his security clearance eligibility. \nBecause of his lack of candor during the security clearance process, the credibility of his \ndenials of committing sex crimes is diminished. The incident report filed by his employer\u2019s \nsecurity office in June 2013 indicates that Applicant minimized the extent of his charges to \nsecurity. On his SF 86 in May 2015, he listed only two charges, of sexual abuse and \ndomestic violence, when he had been charged with 12 felony counts, including aggravated \nrape. He told an OPM investigator in July 2016 that he found out in May 2013 that he was \nbeing indicted on five counts of sexual assault and one count of intimidation of a witness. \nApplicant is reported to have been \u201csurprised and shocked\u201d when he learned of the \nallegations against him. Although he is not a lawyer, Applicant is a college graduate who \ncan reasonably be expected to have known and understood the specific criminal charges \nagainst him. Moreover, he had no credible explanation during his subject interview or at his \nsecurity clearance hearing for the accusations of abuse or his divorce. He maintained that \nhe had good relationships with his ex-wife and his children, which cannot easily be \nreconciled with the fact of his divorce or with the fact that his ex-wife believes her daughter. \nIt is difficult to accept as credible that he does not know the grounds for his divorce and \nthat he never discussed his stepdaughter\u2019s accusations with his ex-wife. Applicant told the \nOPM investigator that his ex-wife filed for divorce shortly after his arrest in February 2013. \nHe now claims that she did not file for about a year. It is noted that when the police came \nto Applicant\u2019s residence, they observed Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter to be upset. She had \nbeen crying, her posture was hunched, and she was drawn in on herself. Her demeanor \nwas consistent with that of a victim. His denials of any inappropriate behavior with his \nstepdaughter lack credibility. He did not present any statements from the victim that she \nrecanted the allegations of sexual assault. I have considerable suspicions that he sexually \nabused his stepdaughter, and I cannot say there is \u201cno reliable evidence\u201d to conclude he \ncommitted the sexual crimes at issue. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \n                                                                                                                                                             \nfrom his sentence for good conduct until he shall have served 10 years of such sentence. \nProsecutions commenced under this section shall neither be continued without a finding nor \nplaced on file. \n\n11 \n \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigations or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nApplicant did not comply with his obligation as a clearance holder to timely report his \narrest to security officials. He was arrested on February 28, 2013, and did not report his \narrest until June 19, 2013. AG \u00b6 16(d) and AG \u00b6 16(e) apply because of the failure to report \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. These provide: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant is alleged to have deliberately lied on his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and during \nhis subject interview (SOR \u00b6 2.c) by claiming that he was falsely accused by his \nstepdaughter of the criminal sexual abuse. A predicate finding that Applicant committed the \ncrimes for which he was arrested and indicted is required before I can conclude that he \ndeliberately lied under AG \u00b6 16(a) as to the SF 86 and AG \u00b6 16(b) as to his interview. For \nthe reasons addressed under Guideline J, I find reliable evidence exists of his culpability. \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. They provide: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in \nmaking a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \n \n \nI note that Applicant was not fully candid on his SF 86 or during his interview about \nthe charges filed against him. He listed only two charges, of sexual abuse and domestic \nviolence, when he knew he had been incited on 12 very serious felony counts, including \nrape. His minimization cannot be considered a disqualifying factor because it was not \n\n12 \n \nspecifically alleged, but it shows a lack of reform and whether his representations are \nreliable. \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges his arrest and the criminal charges under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 \n2.d). Sexual assault of a minor female is conduct which raises considerable judgment \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 15 and vulnerability issues under AG \u00b6 16(e). \n \n \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 have some applicability. They are: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nThe passage of more than five years since the sex crimes is a factor in mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant made some effort to alleviate the concerns of his failure to \nreport under AG \u00b6 17(d) and of vulnerability under AG \u00b6 17(e) by notifying security about \nhis arrest in June 2013, but his disclosure was incomplete. Available information shows \nthat he was intentionally minimizing to his employer when he described the charges filed \nagainst him. He reportedly told security officials that he had delayed informing them of his \narrest because he was scared. At his subject interview, he explained that it was more \nimportant to him to get his personal life in order. He now attributes his failure to timely \nreport to concentrating on caring for his family. None of these reasons justifies his \ndeliberate failure to comply with his known obligation to report adverse information to \nsecurity officials. He did not accurately disclose the criminal counts against him on his SF \n86 or during his subject interview, even though the charges had been nolle prosequi. Little \ninformation was presented about who knows about his arrest record and what they know. \nApplicant has yet to show that he can be counted on to comply with his reporting \nobligations in the future. His persistent denials of any validity to the criminal accusations \nare suspect and continue to cast doubt on his reform. The personal conduct security \nconcerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concerns about sexual behavior are articulated in AG \u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \n\n13 \n \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified for sensitive information. Sexual behavior includes \nconduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written \ntransmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n \n \nThe sex crimes for which Applicant was indicted raise disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6  \n13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been \nprosecuted,\u201d 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;\u201d and 13(d), \u201csexual behavior  . . . that reflects a lack of discretion or \njudgment.\u201d Given the reliable evidence of sexual assault, and his refusal to acknowledge \nany sexual misconduct, none of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 are fully \nestablished. The passage of time alone is insufficient for mitigation under AG \u00b6 14(b) \nbecause of the egregiousness of the behavior. AG \u00b6 14(b) provides: \n \n(b) sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \n \n \nApplicant testified that when he told his supervisor about his arrest, his supervisor \nwalked him to their security office. Even so, it is unclear what he told his supervisor. He \nminimized the charges to security officials and on his SF 86. Applicant did not establish AG \n\u00b6 14(c), \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn the whole-person evaluation, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).9 \n \nApplicant was indicted by a grand jury for 12 serious crimes, any of which are too \negregious to warrant restoration to him of his suspended Secret clearance. He presented \nno reliable evidence to substantiate his claim that none of the criminal accusations have \nmerit. Moreover, there exists a substantial reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s continued security \nclearance eligibility in that he knew he had an obligation to report his arrest and charges to \nhis employer, and he deliberately waited until June 2013, several months after he had \n                                                 \n9 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n14 \n \nbeen first arrested and a month after he was indicted. Applicant did not accurately disclose \nthe charges to his employer, on his SF 86, or during his subject interview. He testified \nevasively when asked about the serious criminal charges and his family relations, leaving \nthe impression that he might say something incriminating if he elaborated. \n \n \nUnder the whole-person evaluation, Applicant\u2019s work performance for his employer \nis unassailable, but it does not entitle him to a clearance. The security clearance \nadjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). For the reasons noted above, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue access to classified information to Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant10 \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 9, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD.1 \n \n                                                          \n1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this \ncase under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using \neither set of AG. \n \n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 22, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 1, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nNovember 27, 2018, scheduling the hearing for December 14, 2018.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel requested that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about the People\u2019s Republic of China (China). The \nrequest was not admitted in evidence but was appended to the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. The facts administratively noticed are summarized in the Findings of \nFact, below.

He is 48 years old, married, and he \nhas two minor children. His wife was born in China and immigrated to the United States \nin 1996. She is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and their children are native-born U.S. \ncitizens. He has owned a home in the United States since 2005.2 \n \nApplicant was born in China. He graduated from a high school in China in 1988, \nand he obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree from a university in China in 1993. He immigrated \nto the United States in 1996 and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2008. He obtained \na master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university in 2002. He has worked as a systems engineer \nfor his current employer, a DOD contractor, since 2016. He was granted access to \npublic trust information in 2011. He has never held a DOD security clearance.3  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, sister, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are citizens \nand residents of China. His mother and father are 75 and 82 years old, respectively. His \nmother retired as a school teacher at age 60. His father retired as a research institute \nprofessor between the age of 65 and 70. Applicant was unaware whether the research \ninstitute was affiliated with the Chinese government. Applicant testified that his father \nhas never served in the Chinese military.4   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents live together in an apartment they own, the value of which \nApplicant was unaware. They are supported by their monthly pensions from the \nChinese government, totaling approximately $1,600 monthly. Applicant talks to his \nmother weekly, primarily to check on her health as she was diagnosed with cancer. He \ntalks to his father four to five times yearly. He visits his parents in China once every two \nyears and last did so in August 2018. He usually travels to China with his wife and \nchildren. His mother visited Applicant and his family in the United States in 2016. He \n \n                                                          \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 6-7, 10-11, 14-16, 25-29, 37, 47-48; GE 1; AE A, B, C, D. \n \n3 Tr. at 14-16, 25-29, 50-52; GE 1; AE A, E. \n \n4 Tr. at 29-37, 46-47, 52-60; GE 1, 2; AE E. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nsent his parents approximately $1,000 in 2000, and he sends his mother vitamin \nsupplements that he buys in the United States. He testified that his parents are aware \nonly that he is an engineer.5  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister is 47 years old. She is married, and her husband is 48 years \nold. They are joint owners of a private business, having applied for and received their \nbusiness license from the Chinese government. Applicant testified that his brother-in-\nlaw never served in the Chinese military, but previously worked for the Chinese \ngovernment. When Applicant visits their parents in China, his sister makes the short trip \nto their parents\u2019 hometown so that Applicant can also see her.  Applicant talks to her \nfour to five times yearly.6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are ages 74 and 75, respectively. \nThey are both retired. They live together in an apartment, the value of which Applicant \nwas unaware. They are also supported by their pensions from the Chinese government. \nHis mother-in-law previously worked as a school teacher. His father-in-law previously \nworked as a general manager of a private travel agency and a school teacher. Applicant \ntestified that neither served in the Chinese military. Applicant speaks to his parents-in-\nlaw two to three times yearly. His wife speaks to her parents weekly. Applicant and his \nwife visit her parents in China once every two years, when they visit his parents.7  \n \n \nApplicant has two sisters-in-law, one of whom resides in China and the other in \nCanada. The sister-in-law in China does not work outside of the home, and her husband \nis a small business owner. Applicant was unaware how often his wife spoke to her sister \nin China. He testified that he does not have any connection to either sister-in-law. He \ntestified that he was unaware whether his wife ever discussed with her family in China \nthe nature of his employment or that he is seeking a security clearance.8 \n \n \n \nApplicant maintains contact with friends who are citizens and residents of China. \nHe has known three to four of such friends since kindergarten. One is a stockbroker; the \nsecond works in information technology for an insurance company; the third is an \nassistant professor; and the fourth one is unemployed. He sees them when he travels to \nChina to visit his parents, and he saw three of them during his August 2018 trip. In \naddition, Applicant has known three to four other such friends since high school and \ncollege. One works for a bank; two are professors at a local college; and the fourth is a \nnurse at a local hospital. He also saw these friends when he visited China in August \n2018.9 \n \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 29-37, 46-47, 52-60, 64-66; GE 1, 2; AE E. \n \n6 Tr. at 35-37, 46-47, 59-60; GE 1, 2; AE E. \n \n7 Tr. at 37-40, 47, 61-65; GE 1, 2; AE E. \n \n8 Tr. at 37-40, 47, 61-65; GE 2; AE E. \n \n9 Tr. at 40-46, 63-64; GE 2; AE E. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s home was valued at $560,000 as of the date of the hearing. He and \nhis wife\u2019s checking, savings, and retirement accounts in the United States total \napproximately $1,000,000. They do not have any foreign assets. His July 2016 \nbackground interview reflects that he told the investigator that he is loyal solely to the \nUnited States. He testified that he is proud to be an American.10 \n \n \nChina \n \nThe National Counterintelligence Executive has identified China as among the \nmost aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information and technology. China\u2019s \nintelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, frequently seek to \nexploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their insider \naccess to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable media devices or email.  \nChinese attempts to collect U.S. economic and technological information will continue at \na high level and will represent a growing threat to U.S. economic security. The nature of \nthe cyber threat will evolve with continuing technological advances in the global \ninformation environment. China\u2019s military modernization is targeting capabilities with the \npotential to degrade core U.S. military-technological advances.  \n \n \nChina is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the \nparamount authority, with its members holding almost all top government and security \napparatus positions. Humans rights concerns observed in 2017 included arbitrary or \nunlawful deprivation of life; executions without due process; forced disappearances; \ntorture and coerced confessions of prisoners; arbitrary detention; illegal detention at \nunofficial holding facilities; significant restrictions on freedom of speech, press, \nassembly, religion, and movement. Authorities continued to maintain ultimate authority \nover all published, online, and broadcast material. \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns visitors to China that they may be placed \nunder surveillance. Hotel rooms, offices, cars, taxis, telephones, internet usage, and fax \nmachines may be monitored onsite or remotely. Personal possessions in hotel rooms, \nincluding computers, may be searched without knowledge or consent.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 46-50; GE 1, 2; AE A, B. \n\n \n5 \n \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, sister, parents-in-law, and friends are citizens and residents \nof China. China has been identified as among the most aggressive collectors of U.S. \neconomic information and technology. China\u2019s intelligence services frequently seek to \nexploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their insider \naccess to steal secrets. Visitors to China may be placed under surveillance, and \npersonal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched without knowledge or consent. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts in China create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) have been raised by the evidence. \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n\n \n7 \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, sister, parents-in-law, and friends are Chinese citizens \nresiding in China. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in \nthe above discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e). Applicant regularly contacts his \nparents, sister, and parents-in-law. His wife also does the same with her parents. \nApplicant also sees his friends in China when he travels there to visit his family. AG \u00b6 \n8(c) is not established.  \n \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 1996. He obtained a master\u2019s \ndegree from a U.S. university in 2002. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008. \nHis wife is also a naturalized U.S. citizen, and their children are native-born U.S \ncitizens. They own a home and have substantial financial interests in the United States \nand none in China. These are factors that weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, \nApplicant\u2019s ties to his family in China are equally as strong. Applicant failed to meet his \nburden to demonstrate that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n8 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s access to public trust information since 2011. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluating \nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his family and friends in China. Accordingly, \nI conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has been married since March 2011 to a native of the Kyrgyz Republic \n(Kyrgyzstan) who became naturalized in the United States in June 2018. His spouse no \nlonger owns any property in the foreign country, and her daughter, a Kyrgyz citizen, has \nU.S. permanent residency. However, foreign influence security concerns are not fully \nmitigated because of his spouse\u2019s family ties to Kyrgyzstan, including a sibling who spent \nhis career with the Kyrgyz government. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 4, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n01/31/2019\n\n \n \n2 \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 2, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nSeptember 7, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On October 5, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for November 15, \n2018. \n \nAt the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) were admitted. A May 30, \n2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were marked \nas hearing exhibits (HEs I-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. At the \nGovernment\u2019s request and without objection from Applicant, I agreed to take \nadministrative notice of several facts pertinent to the Kyrgyz Republic, as set forth in a \nMay 30, 2018 Request for Administrative Notice-Kyrgyzstan (Kyrgyz Republic),1 which \nwas entered in evidence as GE 3. Ten Applicant exhibits (AEs A-J) were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received \non November 29, 2018. \n \nI held the record open for three weeks after the hearing for Applicant to respond to \nGE 3 and to submit facts for administrative notice. On November 28, 2018, Applicant \nsubmitted four U.S. State Department reports on human rights in the Kyrgyz Republic \nand a Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) article. The \ndocuments were admitted without objection as AE K. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a resident \ncitizen of Kyrgyzstan employed by the Kyrgyz government (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that Applicant\u2019s \nspouse (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and daughter-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.c) are Kyrgyz citizens; that Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law is a resident citizen of Kyrgyzstan (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that Applicant\u2019s spouse \nowns an apartment in Kyrgyzstan valued at approximately $45,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.e.). In a \ndetailed response to the SOR, Applicant indicated that with a change in leadership in the \nKyrgyz Republic following October 2017 elections, his brother-in-law has been removed \nfrom his government position, and his employment status was unclear. Applicant \nexplained that his immediate family had no direct contact with him and so learned about \nhis status from extended family members. Applicant admitted that his spouse and \nstepdaughter had Kyrgyz citizenship, but his spouse\u2019s U.S. citizenship test was scheduled \nfor May 30, 2018. His stepdaughter was employed in the United States and planned to \napply for her U.S. citizenship at her earliest opportunity next year. Applicant admitted his \nfather-in-law\u2019s residency and citizenship in Kyrgyzstan. Regarding the apartment in the \nKyrgyz Republic, Applicant explained that his spouse sold the apartment in June 2017 \nafter his stepdaughter graduated from college in Kyrgyzstan. \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n                                                 \n1 The country is formally known as the Kyrgyz Republic, although the country is often referred to as \nKyrgyzstan. The U.S. government uses the terms interchangeably when referring to the country. \n\n \n \n3 \nApplicant is a 56-year-old global security specialist, who has worked for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, since December 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 48.) He attended \ncollege on a Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) scholarship, and earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering. He entered on active duty in the U.S. military \nin April 1984. (GE 1.) He held a DOD security clearance throughout his active duty service \nand worked on several classified programs. (Tr. 26-27, 44.) Applicant married in \nDecember 1986, but he and his first wife divorced in August 1988. (GE 1; Tr. 49.) \n \nIn April 1990, Applicant was granted an honorable discharge from active duty, and \nhis clearance eligibility lapsed for about a year. (Tr. 47.) In February 1991, Applicant and \nhis second wife married, and they had a son in March 1993. (GE 1.) From April 1993 to \nAugust 2004, Applicant worked as a civilian contractor with a clearance at a U.S. military \nresearch laboratory. After being in the inactive reserve for six years, he returned to the \nmilitary as an active reservist in 1996. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 27, 47.)  \n \nFrom August 2004 to December 2005, Applicant was employed as a program \ndirector for a federal contractor at a space center. In January 2006, he began teaching at \na public university as a state employee. (GE 1.) He continued to maintain security \nclearance eligibility for his duties in his military reserve unit, and he was called to active \nduty during the summers. From June 2006 to September 2006, he was stationed in the \nKyrgyz Republic as an active-duty reservist. Applicant became friends with his current \nwife, a native Kyrgyz resident citizen who worked as a contractor at the base\u2019s exchange. \n(Tr. 51.) Applicant was stationed in the United States during the summer of 2007, and \nwas deployed to Tajikistan in the summer of 2008. (GE 2; Tr. 45-46.) \n \nIn June 2009, Applicant left his job as a university lecturer. He was recalled to \nactive duty that summer and served in Europe. He and his current spouse began dating \nin July 2009. (Tr. 43, 51.) From November 2009 to May 2012, he was stationed in the \nKyrgyz Republic as an active duty reservist for the U.S. military at the rank of lieutenant \ncolonel. Applicant and his current spouse continued dating. In December 2010, \nApplicant\u2019s divorce from his second wife was finalized. (GEs 1-2.) \n \nIn March 2011, Applicant and his current spouse married in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n(GE 1; Tr. 52.) She had been previously married against her will, and had two children, \nincluding a daughter born in June 1995 who took Applicant\u2019s surname on her mother\u2019s \nmarriage to Applicant.2 (GE 1; AE G.) Applicant met his spouse\u2019s family members while \nhe was stationed in Kyrgyzstan, and he asserts that he reported his foreign marriage and \ncontacts as required to his command. (Tr. 27.) \n \n                                                 \n2 Applicant\u2019s spouse provided a statement in which she indicated that she was kidnapped and forced to \nmarry. (AE G.) Applicant testified that his spouse was kidnapped when she was 19 or 20 (Tr. 81), although \naccording to his SF 86 (GE 1), she retained the same name from her birth in January 1975 until January \n2006, when she was 30 years old. She indicated that after she left her first husband, she was forced out of \nher brother\u2019s apartment when she had no income and two children to support. (AE G.) Applicant listed only \nhis stepdaughter on his SF 86 (GE 1) and little to nothing is known about his spouse\u2019s other child, including \nwhether he or she is even alive. \n\n \n \n4 \nApplicant maintained a legal permanent residence in the United States, and he \nand his spouse had a son born in the United States in October 2011 and baptized in the \nUnited States in early June 2012. (GEs 1-2; AE I.) After his active duty deployment ended \nin May 2012, Applicant resumed his weekend reservist status until he retired from the \nmilitary as a colonel in May 2014. (Tr. 46.)  \n \nIn April 2012, Applicant\u2019s spouse purchased an apartment in Kyrgyzstan for \napproximately $45,000 so that her daughter (then age 16) would have a place to live while \nin college in the country. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 34, 58.) In early June 2012, Applicant began \nworking under a personal services contract as a member of the administrative and \ntechnical staff at a U.S. Embassy in Eastern Europe. Available records show that his DOD \nsecret clearance was transferred to his new position through reciprocity and that his \nspouse, his son from his second marriage, his young son from his current marriage, and \nhis stepdaughter were authorized to accompany him to his post in foreign country X. (AE \nJ.) Applicant testified that his family accompanied him to live on the embassy compound.3 \n(Tr. 27.) In August 2013, Applicant and his spouse had another son, who was born in the \nUnited States. (GE 1.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s stepdaughter finished high school in foreign country X and enrolled in \nengineering studies at a technical school. In the summer of 2013, she transferred to a \nuniversity in the Kyrgyz Republic that then closed. She then attended a private university \nin Kyrgyzstan that was started with the financial assistance of a U.S. philanthropist. \nClasses were in English and Russian. (AE A; Tr. 52, 55-56, 79.) \n \n   \nWhile working at the U.S. Embassy in foreign country X, Applicant started the \nprocess for his spouse and stepdaughter to legally immigrate to the United States. His \nspouse and stepdaughter became legal permanent residents in October 2014. (Tr. 28.) \n \nIn September 2015, Applicant\u2019s contract with the U.S. government ended. \nApplicant and his immediate family returned to the United States, and in November 2015, \nthey moved into a condominium in the United States owned by his parents. (GE 1; Tr. \n28.) As of March 2016, Applicant had a job offer with a defense contractor (not his current \nemployer) contingent on renewal of his security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 28.) He \ncompleted and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86) on March 28, 2016. He disclosed the Kyrgyz citizenship of his spouse and his \nstepdaughter; his stepdaughter\u2019s attendance at a university in Kyrgyzstan; and his father-\nin-law\u2019s Kyrgyz residency and citizenship. His mother-in-law was deceased. He indicated \nthat he had weekly contact with his stepdaughter and annual in-person contact with his \nfather-in-law, who is a retired. In response to any inquiry concerning foreign contacts, \nApplicant listed a brother-in-law, who works for a Kyrgyz police unit, with whom he had \nquarterly contact. In response to foreign government contacts, Applicant listed another \nbrother-in-law (brother-in-law X) who has intelligence duties for the Kyrgyz government. \nThey met occasionally at family events until as recently as October 2015. Applicant added \n                                                 \n3 Applicant discrepantly told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator in August 2016 that \nhis family resided at his U.S. home of record while he was working abroad and that he visited them when \non leave between October 2011 and September 2015. (GE 2.)  \n\n \n \n5 \nthat he had reported the contacts to security personnel, but was advised \u201cto report only if \ndiscussions stray from family activities,\u201d which had not occurred. Applicant also disclosed \nthat his spouse owned an apartment in the Kyrgyz Republic that she purchased for \n$45,000 in April 2012 after selling her previous home acquired in April 2006. Applicant \nlisted travel to Kyrgyzstan in August 2008 for tourism, in March 2014 to visit family and \nfriends, and in July 2015 and again from September 2015 to October 2015 for family \nreunions. He indicated that brother-in-law X attended the family reunions. (GE 1.) \n \nOn August 2, 2016, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOPM. Applicant related that his stepdaughter returns each year to Kyrgyzstan for college \nand that they have monthly contact when she is in Kyrgyzstan. Applicant denied any legal \ninvolvement in the purchase of his spouse\u2019s apartment in Kyrgyzstan, which had declined \nin value to approximately $35,000. He explained that the property would be sold when his \nstepdaughter graduates from college, Applicant was unable to provide information about \nhis father-in-law\u2019s residence or previous employments. As for his relationship to brother-\nin-law X, Applicant indicated that he had only incidental social contact with him in July \n2015 and October 2015 while visiting his spouse\u2019s family, and that their conversations \nwere limited to family matters. Applicant denied any vulnerability to foreign influence \nbecause of this family relationship and stated that he would immediately notify proper \nauthorities of any contacts, requests, or threats by foreign persons or organizations. \nApplicant denied any improper contact or pressure by anyone seeking classified or \nsensitive information during any of his foreign travels, including to the Kyrgyz Republic. \n(GE 2.) \n \nIn March 2016, Applicant\u2019s spouse changed her first name to an English name so \nthat her two young sons would not have to explain why their mother had a foreign name. \n(GE 1; AE G; Tr. 28, 82.) In December 2016, with his background investigation still \npending to renew his clearance to work for another defense contractor, Applicant \naccepted a position with his current employer that did not require a security clearance. \nHe withdrew his application to renew his security clearance on receipt of an SOR alleging \nforeign influence security concerns. (Tr. 28-29, 48.) \n \nIn early June 2017, Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in \nbusiness from the university in the Kyrgyz Republic and returned to the United States. \n(AE B; Tr. 56.) Two weeks later, Applicant\u2019s spouse sold her apartment in Kyrgyzstan, \nand sales proceeds of $35,435 were wired into Applicant\u2019s checking account in the United \nStates. (AE D; Tr. 35, 59.) In July 2017, they used $30,632 of the funds as the down-\npayment for Applicant and his spouse\u2019s current residence. (AE E; Tr. 37, 58-59.) They \nbought their home for $515,000 in part with a mortgage loan of $496,588. (AE C; Tr. 59.) \n \nAbout a year into his current employment, Applicant\u2019s employer requested that he \nobtain a security clearance for some military programs. On April 4, 2018, the DOD CAF \nissued a SOR alleging foreign influence security concerns because of Applicant\u2019s familial \nconnections to the Kyrgyz Republic and his spouse\u2019s apartment, which she no longer \nowned. (Tr. 29.) \n\n \n \n6 \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was interviewed for her U.S. naturalization in late May 2018. \n(AE A.) She took the oath of naturalization in June 2018, and within days she obtained \nher U.S. passport. (AEs G; H; Tr. 53.)  Applicant\u2019s spouse asserts that her loyalty is \u201cfirst \nand foremost to America and [her] American family.\u201d Although she and all of her siblings \ngraduated from college or took some advance coursework in the Kyrgyz Republic (Tr. \n84), Applicant\u2019s spouse asserts that she came from a traditional family that did not treat \ndaughters well. She was not allowed to return home after she was forced to marry, and \nafter she left her ex-husband, her brother (brother-in-law X) forced her from his apartment \nwhen she had no income and two children to support. Her family would not take her in, \nand she asserts that it \u201chardened [her] to the reality of Kyrgyz tradition.\u201d (AE G.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s stepdaughter also maintains that her full loyalty is to her American \nfamily. She considers Applicant to be her father. She has no desire to return to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and intends to become a U.S. citizen when she is first eligible in October 2019. \nShe lives with Applicant and her mother, has a full-time job as a health service \ncoordinator, and pays taxes to the United States. Although she wishes her mother\u2019s family \nin Kyrgyzstan no harm, they did not treat her or her mother well. (AE F.) \n \nSince May 2012, when he closed a bank account that he had previously held while \nserving in the Kyrgyz Republic, Applicant\u2019s ties to Kyrgyzstan have been solely familial \nthrough his spouse. In addition to his father-in-law, six of his spouse\u2019s siblings (four \nbrothers and two sisters) live in the Kyrgyz Republic and speak Russian, which is still the \nbusiness language in the region. At least five if not all six of the siblings has Kyrgyz \ncitizenship.4 (Tr. 72-73, 80.) Applicant\u2019s spouse and perhaps all but one of her siblings \nattended college, although all of them had some type of advanced schooling.5 (Tr. 84-\n85.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law in Kyrgyzstan is now 80 years old and retired. Applicant \ndenies knowing about his father-in-law\u2019s previous occupation. He never asked his father-\n                                                 \n4 Four of the seven foreign contacts on Applicant\u2019s SF 86 are native Kyrgyz citizens. Applicant did not clearly \ndescribe his relationship with them apart from the brother-in-law, who had worked as a fraud investigator. \nThe foreign contacts include a 39-year-old working in Dubai who has the same surname as Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law; a 36-year-old married homemaker living in Australia; and a 32-year-old housekeeper (formerly \nan economics teacher) living in Kyrgyzstan. They may be siblings of Applicant\u2019s spouse, given they were \nall born in the same city as his spouse. (GE 1.) Whether due to lack of contact with them or limited \nknowledge, Applicant has not fully disclosed the extent of his spouse\u2019s family ties to Kyrgyzstan. \n \n5 Applicant testified, \u201cI know the family emphasized everyone going to college.\u201d (Tr. 84.) When confronted \nabout the inconsistency between his spouse\u2019s account that she came from such a traditional household \nthat she was forced to marry (bride kidnapping) and the family\u2019s emphasis on college for even the \ndaughters, Applicant responded: \n \nThe youngest [daughter] was the favorite, and so she went [to college]. The oldest one, I \nthink it had to do with the Soviet system, the two older ones. I mean the Soviet system \nwas\u2014it was, they grew up\u2014I don\u2019t remember when the Soviet Union fell, but they went \nduring the Soviet system, and so it was part of the process. And then my wife, she actually \nhad to fight to go [to college]. She went, but had to really convince a brother to help her \npay for school. (Tr. 85.) \n\n \n \n7 \nin-law whether he ever had any affiliation with the Kyrgyz military or government. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse calls her father once a month. To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, she has not \ntold her father that he is applying for a security clearance. (Tr. 61-62.) Applicant indicated \non his SF 86 that he had in-person contact with his father-in-law annually between June \n2010 and October 2015 (GE 1), although he now asserts that he probably saw his father-\nin-law during his trips to Kyrgyzstan. His spouse usually traveled to Kyrgyzstan before \nhim so she could stay longer to visit her relatives, including her father. (Tr. 63.) Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law speaks both the Kyrgyz and Russian languages but not English. Their \nconversations were limited because of the language barrier. When they occurred they \nwere in Russian because Applicant speaks a little Russian. (Tr. 37.) \n \nApplicant testified that he has heard that his spouse\u2019s brother in Kyrgyzstan, who \nhad worked in fraud investigations, is no longer so employed. He denies knowing about \nthis brother-in-law\u2019s current occupation. His spouse has contact with this brother on a \nmonthly basis. Applicant believes this brother-in-law does not know that he has applied \nfor a security clearance. (Tr. 71-72.) \n \nRegarding brother-in-law X, Applicant understands that he spent his entire career \nafter college with the Kyrgyz government. Although Applicant indicated in response to the \nSOR that this brother-in-law had been removed from his position with the change in \ngovernment in the country following the October 2017 elections, he testified there is no \nway of knowing for certain. Applicant had heard from his spouse through her sister that \nhis brother-in-law moved to another city after the change in administration. (Tr. 64-65, \n78.) Applicant had in-person contact with this brother-in-law at family functions, about two \nor three times total when Applicant lived in Kyrgyzstan, and during his trips to the country \nin 2014 and 2015. This brother-in-law does not speak English, so Applicant relied on his \nwife, his stepdaughter, or one of his wife\u2019s sisters to interpret. This brother-in-law knows \nthat Applicant was in the U.S. military and also that he had worked in a U.S. embassy. \nApplicant does not believe that his stepdaughter had any contact with brother-in-law X \nwhile she was attending college in Kyrgyzstan because brother-in-law X is \u201cestranged to \nour family.\u201d After his spouse left her previous husband, she lived in an apartment owned \nby brother-in-law X, and he threw her out when she had two young children to support \nand no income. As the senior member of Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s siblings, he wanted to \ndirect her life. (Tr. 67-68, 75.) Applicant believes his spouse had no current \ncorrespondence with this brother. Applicant has told his spouse that her brother\u2019s \noccupation could impact his clearance. (Tr. 79.) \n \nAs for any other family members or friends in the Kyrgyz Republic with whom his \nspouse maintains contact more often than every few years, Applicant responded that his \nspouse \u201cmight contact her older sister.\u201d (Tr. 72.) As to whether Applicant had in-person \ncontact with his spouse\u2019s siblings during the family gatherings in Kyrgyzstan, he \nresponded that he saw some of them (\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a hit or miss kind of thing. It depends \non what the gathering is or where it is.\u201d). (Tr. 73.)   \n \nApplicant asserts that he would immediately report if he was approached for any \nclassified or sensitive information. He has discussed with his spouse that he would have \n\n \n \n8 \nto report if someone attempted to use her family in Kyrgyzstan because he does not want \nto risk jeopardizing their sons and daughter\u2019s future. (Tr. 69-70.) Applicant and his spouse \nintend to raise their sons in the United States. They plan to have their younger son \nbaptized in the United States. (AE G.) \n \nAs of November 2018, Applicant\u2019s spouse did not work outside the home. She had \nworked in retail in the United States for one year. (Tr. 54.) Applicant\u2019s annual salary with \na defense contractor was $124,000 although it was soon to be increased to $138,000. \n(Tr. 48.) In addition to the $65,000 in equity in their home, Applicant had $60,000 in 401(k) \nassets and $15,000 in combined checking and savings deposits. (Tr. 59-60.) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic (or Kyrgyzstan) is a landlocked, mountainous Central Asian \ncountry that became a Soviet republic in 1936. It achieved independence on August 31, \n1991, when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics dissolved. Predominantly rural and \nMuslim, the country has a population of 5.8 million, of which 73.2% are native Kyrgyz. A \nparliamentary republic, it is governed by an elected president as head of state; by an \nappointed prime minister as head of the government; and by a Supreme Council of 120 \nseats. The president holds substantial powers even though the prime minister oversees \nthe Kyrgyz government and selects most cabinet members. The president represents the \ncountry internationally and can sign or veto laws, call for new elections, and nominate \nSupreme Court judges, cabinet members for posts related to security or defense, and \nnumerous other high-level positions. \n \nNationwide protests because of violations in parliamentary elections led to the \noverthrow of the country\u2019s first president in March 2005. Under a new president elected \nin July 2005, the Kyrgyz Republic made tangible progress towards meeting international \nstandards. The country\u2019s human rights record improved considerably, although limitations \non due process and other human rights problems persisted. Following a week of \nopposition-led street protests, the country adopted a new constitution on November 9, \n2006, which provided for greater checks and balances among the branches of \ngovernment. On December 30, 2006, the parliament adopted a revised version of the \nconstitution that restored many powers to the president but also a greater role for political \nparties. \n \nOn April 7, 2010, the Kyrgyz Republic had a violent change of government and \napproved a new constitution and a temporary president in a June 27 national referendum. \nOctober 10, 2010 parliamentary elections were generally free and fair, and Almazbek \nAtambaev was sworn in as president in 2011. On October 15, 2017, former prime minister \nand ruling Social-Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan member Sooronbai Jeenbekov was \nelected to succeed outgoing president Atambaev, who became the first Kyrgyz president \nto step down after serving one full six-year term as required in the country\u2019s constitution. \nKyrgyzstan's 2017 presidential election marked the first peaceful transfer of presidential \npower from one democratically-elected president to another in post-Soviet Central Asia. \nIt was the most competitive in the country\u2019s history, although international and local \n\n \n \n9 \nelection observers noted cases of vote buying and misuse of public resources. Prime \nminister Abyl-Gaziev took office on April 20, 2018 \n \nFollowing independence, Kyrgyzstan rapidly implemented market reforms, such \nas improving the regulatory system and instituting land reform. In 1998, Kyrgyzstan was \nthe first Commonwealth of Independent States country to be accepted into the World \nTrade Organization. The government has privatized much of its ownership shares \nin public enterprises. Significant impediments to Kyrgyzstan's development include \nendemic corruption, aging infrastructure, high unemployment, and endemic poverty. \n \nThe United States established diplomatic relations with the Kyrgyz Republic on \nDecember 25, 1991, following the country\u2019s independence from the Soviet Union. The \nUnited States supports the Kyrgyz Republic in its development of an inclusive democracy \nbased upon the rule of law and respect for human rights. U.S. Government assistance \ngoals in Kyrgyzstan are to strengthen democratic institutions, support broad-based \neconomic opportunity, enhance regional security, promote greater respect for human \nrights and the rule of law, and address development challenges in health and education. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic and the United States belong to a number of the same international \norganizations, including the United Nations, Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, International Monetary Fund, World \nBank, and World Trade Organization. Kyrgyzstan also is a participant in the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization's (NATO) Partnership for Peace program. The Kyrgyz Republic and \nthe United States have a bilateral trade agreement. The Kyrgyz Republic also signed a \ntrade and investment framework agreement with the United States and other Central \nAsian countries establishing a regional forum for addressing trade issues and enhancing \ntrade and investment between the United States and Central Asia. \n \nAt the same time, Manas Air Base in the Kyrgyz Republic, which had served as a \ntransit and logistics base for U.S. troops heading to Afghanistan, was turned over to the \nKyrgyz military in June 2014 after Kyrgyz\u2019s parliament passed legislation to end the U.S.\u2019 \nlease on the base. As of February 2018, the U.S. Defense Department was concerned \nabout Russian influence in Central Asia and the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s increasing alliance \nwith Russia and China.6 \n \n                                                 \n6 Pursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political conditions in evaluating \nGuideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007)), I note that at a hearing \nbefore the U.S. House Armed Services Committee held on February 27, 2018, the Commander of the U.S. \nCentral Command stated, in part: \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic has increasingly aligned its interests with Russia and China. The \nU.S.-Kyrgyz security relationship has declined since the closure of the Manas Transit \nCenter and the termination of the bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement in 2014. \nDespite the Kyrgyz armed forces\u2019 desire to improve military-to-military cooperation with \nCENTCOM, Kyrgyz senior civilian leaders have shown little interest in improving military \nrelations. \n \nSee www.centcom.mil/ABOUT--US/POSTURE--STATEMENT/ \n\n \n \n10 \nThe Kyrgyz Republic benefits from a robust civil society, and the government \ngenerally respects laws providing for the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association, \ninternal movement, foreign travel, and emigration and repatriation. Continuing concerns \nfor the country include the trajectory of democratization; endemic corruption; a history of \ntense, at times violent, inter-ethnic relations; border security vulnerabilities; and potential \nterrorist threats. \n  \nEthnic, political, and socio-economic tensions continue to simmer in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. During 2016, Kyrgyzstan remained vulnerable to transnational threats, \nespecially in the remote south. The U.S. Embassy reviews travel of Embassy employees \nto Batken Oblast because ill-defined and porous borders allow for the relatively free \nmovement of people and illicit goods, rendering the region vulnerable to transnational \nthreats and could facilitate the establishment of terrorist safe havens. Rugged terrain and \na lack of resources prevent authorities from adequately controlling the borders. Lack of \neconomic opportunity was identified as a significant driver of violent extremism in the \ncountry, which forces a large portion of the population to seek employment opportunities \nin Russia, where they are particularly susceptible to recruitment. \n \nOn August 30, 2016 a vehicle-borne explosive device was detonated at the \nChinese Embassy located less than 300 meters from the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek, \nKyrgyzstan\u2019s capital city. Kyrgyz police located and detonated several explosive devices \nnear downtown Bishkek in September 2016 and have since made several terrorism-\nrelated arrests throughout the Kyrgyz Republic. Areas along the Kyrgyz-Uzbek and \nKyrgyz-Tajik borders continue to have small, but sometimes violent and deadly, \nskirmishes between border guards on both sides, which have affected civilians. These \nskirmishes often result from land use disputes. Organized crime related to smuggling and \nnarcotics trafficking are widespread in the southern corridors of the Kyrgyz Republic. Due \nto the exit of Coalition Forces from Afghanistan in 2014, the Kyrgyz government is \nconcerned that terrorist and extremist groups may move north into Tajikistan and \nKyrgyzstan. \n \nAs of March 2018, the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security \nassessed Bishkek as a high-threat location for crime and political violence and as a \nmedium-threat location for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. government \ninterests. U.S. citizens visiting the country have been robbed by groups of young men \nwho followed them back to their residences from hotels and bars. In addition, U.S. citizens \nhave been victims of rape, assault, sexual harassment and kidnapping. Attackers do not \nalways avoid violent confrontation with their victims. Harassment and extortion by people \nwho purport to be Kyrgyz police officers has happened in local markets and in areas \nfrequented by Westerners. Even so, the State Department\u2019s travel advisory to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic as of April 24, 2018, was Level I: Exercise Normal Precautions. \n \nSignificant human rights issues persisted in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2017 involving \nlaw enforcement and security services officers\u2019 use of torture and arbitrary arrest; \nincreasing pressure on independent media; harassment of journalists; selective and \npolitically motivated prosecutions; pervasive corruption; forced labor; and attacks, threats, \n\n \n \n11 \nand systematic police-driven extortion of sexual and ethnic minority groups. Official \nimpunity was a significant problem. While authorities investigated reports of official abuse \nin the security services and elsewhere, they rarely prosecuted and punished officials \naccused of human rights violations, or complicity in trafficking. While the law provides for \nan independent judiciary, judges were subject to influence or corruption. Throughout the \nyear there were multiple instances where the conduct and outcomes of trials appeared \npredetermined. Numerous sources, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), \nattorneys, government officials, and private citizens, asserted judges paid bribes to attain \ntheir positions. Many attorneys asserted that bribe taking was ubiquitous among judges. \nAuthorities generally respected court orders. Numerous NGOs described pervasive \nviolations of the right to a fair trial, including coerced confessions, use of torture, denial of \naccess to counsel, and convictions in the absence of sufficiently conclusive evidence or \ndespite exculpatory evidence. International observers reported threats and acts of \nviolence against defendants and defense attorneys within and outside the courtroom, as \nwell as intimidation of trial judges by victims\u2019 relatives and friends. Law enforcement \nofficers, particularly in the southern part of the country, frequently employed arbitrary \narrest, torture, and the threat of criminal prosecution as a means of extorting cash \npayments from citizens. \n \nKyrgyz law provides for freedom of expression, including for members of the press, \nand citizens generally were free to exercise these rights. NGO leaders and media rights \nadvocates, however, asserted the situation worsened during the year, highlighting the \nincrease in libel lawsuits against independent media outlets and journalists and forced \nclosure of news agencies. Self-censorship was prevalent, and some journalists reported \npressure from editors and political figures to bias their reporting on sensitive topics. Some \njournalists reported intimidation related to coverage of sensitive topics, such as inter-\nethnic relations, \u201creligious extremism,\u201d or the rise of nationalism. In recent years there \nwere attempts to proscribe independent media from operating freely in the country. Tight \ngovernment controls over news content on state television was widely acknowledged. \nMedia rights advocates noted increasing pressure on media outlets in advance of the \n2017 October presidential election. The Kyrgyz government failed to enforce laws against \nrape effectively, and rape cases were underreported. Police generally regarded spousal \nrape as an administrative, rather than a criminal, offense. While the law specifically \nprohibits domestic violence and spousal abuse, violence against women and girls \nremained a significant yet underreported problem. \n \n \nThe CSCE estimated in August 2017 that 12,000 young women in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic are kidnapped and forced to marry their abductors. Although illegal since 1994, \n\u201cbride kidnapping\u201d is socially accepted as a Kyrgyz tradition and is often justified by the \nperpetrator on that basis. According to the CSCE, in Kyrgyz society, particularly in the \nrural areas, an unmarried woman\u2019s reputation can be irrevocably damaged if she spends \neven a single night outside her family home so she may feel she has no recourse other \nthan to consent to the marriage. The CSCE attributes the practice to Kyrgyz assertion of \nethnicity and tradition as a way to distance themselves from their Soviet past and affirm \nthe country\u2019s independent identity (ethic nationalism). As a participating state of the Office \nof Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Kyrgyz Republic is a party to several \n\n \n \n12 \nOSCE commitments to gender equality and is making efforts to end the practice of bride \nkidnapping. In 2013, the penalty for bride kidnapping was increased from three to seven \nyears in prison. In 2016, a new law was enacted against underage marriages and forced \nmarriages that holds accountable those who perform them and the relatives who \nparticipate in organizing them. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n \n \n13 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nApplicant has familial ties through marriage to the Kyrgyz Republic that raise \nforeign influence security concerns. Applicant\u2019s spouse is a native of the Kyrgyz Republic \nwho became a U.S. permanent resident in October 2014, moved to the United States in \nSeptember 2015, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2018. Her daughter, now \nage 23, has been a citizen of Kyrgyzstan since birth. She acquired her U.S. green card in \nOctober 2014, but attended college in Kyrgyzstan and so has lived continuously in the \nUnited States only since June 2017. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s father and six of her siblings \nare currently residents of Kyrgyzstan. Five if not all six of those siblings are citizens of \nKyrgyzstan. One of her brothers with Kyrgyz residency and citizenship began working for \nthe Kyrgyz government on his graduation from college. As of Applicant\u2019s OPM interview \nin August 2016, this brother-in-law was an intelligence official. Applicant has heard that \nhis brother-in-law was removed from his position with the change in government in \nOctober 2017, but he does not know for certain. \n \n  Review of Applicant\u2019s contacts and connections to these foreign citizens through \nmarriage is warranted to determine whether they present a heightened risk under AG \u00b6 \n7(a) or AG \u00b6 7(e) or create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those \ndisqualifying conditions provide: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n \n14 \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(e) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the family ties or \nother foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in assessing \nwhether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the foreign \ngovernment; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United \nStates. In considering the nature of the foreign government, the administrative judge must \ntake into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case \nNo. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \n \nApplicant has bonds of affection and obligation to his spouse, who now enjoys the \nprotections of U.S. citizenship and residency, and to his stepdaughter, who is a U.S. legal \npermanent resident with Kyrgyz citizenship. There is also a rebuttable presumption that \na person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of his or \nher spouse. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-12659 (App. Bd. May 30, 2013). Applicant \nindicated on his SF 86 that his only contact with his father-in-law was in person, once \nannually. However, Applicant\u2019s spouse is in monthly contact with her father. Applicant \nindicated on his SF 86 that he has quarterly contact with her brother who was then a fraud \ninvestigator in Kyrgyzstan. He testified that his spouse has monthly contact with her \nbrother and that she also has some contact with an older sister in Kyrgyzstan. Little \ninformation was provided about that sister, who was not listed by Applicant on his SF 86 \nor discussed during his interview. Applicant and his spouse suggested that they are \nsomewhat estranged from some of her family members in Kyrgyzstan, particularly from \nher brother (brother-in-law X) employed by the Kyrgyz government for most, if not all, of \nhis career. However, the evidence shows that Applicant and his spouse got together with \nher family, including brother-in-law X, during family events when they lived in Kyrgyzstan \nuntil May 2012, and during trips to Kyrgyz for family visits and reunions in March 2014, \nJuly 2015, and October 2015. She traveled to Kyrgyz early to have more time with her \nfamily. \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic and the United States have good relations, although the DOD \nis concerned about growing Russian influence in the region and the decline in the security \nrelationship between the Kyrgyz Republic and the United States. With its mixed human \nrights record and brother-in-law X\u2019s longtime career in intelligence for Kyrgyzstan, there \nis a heightened risk of undue foreign influence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established. \n\n \n \n15 \nApplicant\u2019s spouse had owned an apartment in Kyrgyzstan that she purchased for \n$45,000 in April 2012. Although not significant to Applicant in terms of his overall financial \nsituation, it was important to his stepdaughter because it was her residence while \nattending college. Given that the property was sold in June 2017 and the sales proceeds \nwere wired to the United States well before the SOR was issued, AG \u00b6 7(f) is not \nestablished.7  \n \nThe burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the risk of undue foreign influence that \nexists because of his familial ties through marriage to Kyrgyzstan, a former member state \nof the USSR that continues to align its interests to some extent with Russia, a country \nknown to target the United States and its citizens for sensitive and classified information. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) provides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States.  \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s family members in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic have attempted to obtain classified or sensitive information from Applicant. Even \nso, AG \u00b6 8(a) is difficult to apply based on what is known about his spouse\u2019s siblings in \nKyrgyzstan. Applicant\u2019s spouse and the older of her siblings, if not all of them, were raised \nin Kyrgyzstan when it was part of the USSR. They were taught Russian under a Soviet \nsystem which emphasized education, and they all had advanced schooling. They speak \nKyrgyz and Russian, and it is unclear whether they have fully embraced democratic \ninstitutions and proclivities. Apparently only one of her sisters knows English. Her oldest \nbrother, who was described by Applicant as the head of the family, spent his career in \nintelligence for the Kyrgyz government. Even if her brother was removed from his position \non the change of administrations in October 2017, his past employment presents a risk \nthat Applicant will be placed in the untenable position of having to choose between the \ninterests of his spouse or those of her family members with Kyrgyz citizenship or \nresidency with whom she has ongoing relations.  \n  \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has any loyalty or affiliation to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic or its institutions, but it is difficult to conclude that the bonds of affection or \nobligation to his spouse and her immediate family members, including her daughter and \nfather, are so minimal to satisfy the first part of AG \u00b6 8(b), which provides: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \n                                                 \n7 AG \u00b6 7(f) applies when there is a \u201csubstantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the individual to a heightened risk \nof foreign influence, or exploitation, or personal conflict of interest.\u201d \n \n\n \n \n16 \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships and loyalties in the United States may still be so deep and \nlongstanding that he can be counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. \nIn that regard, he is a native U.S. citizen who served honorably on active duty and in the \nreserves for the U.S. military. His three sons are U.S. citizens and reside in the United \nStates. Applicant owns property in the United States, and his employment is in the United \nStates. He held clearances over the years with no evidence of any security infractions or \nviolations. He has no foreign assets. His spouse intends to reside permanently in the \nUnited States, and as evidence of her intention in that regard, she became a U.S. citizen. \nHer daughter now lives and works in the United States and intends to apply for U.S. \ncitizenship at her first opportunity. While AG \u00b6 8(b) has some applicability, I am concerned \nabout the fact that Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law X knows that Applicant served in the U.S. \nmilitary and worked for the United States government at an embassy. Applicant admitted \nthat there is no way to know whether his brother-in-law\u2019s employment with the Kyrgyz \ngovernment has ended. \n \nApplicant testified that he will immediately report any efforts to approach or \ninfluence him by or through foreign sources, including his spouse\u2019s relatives. Some \nconcern arises that he may not recognize or report an improper contact. If Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony is credible, he has made little effort to inform himself of even basic information \nabout his spouse\u2019s relatives and their activities. It could be said that he minimizes his risk \nby knowing little. At the same time, he has the burden of mitigation to address the foreign \ninfluence security concerns, and he did not show himself to be fully forthcoming about the \nextent of his spouse\u2019s foreign ties to Kyrgyzstan. The Government was not aware before \nApplicant\u2019s hearing that his spouse has two sisters and four brothers in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. Conceivably, Kyrgyz authorities could bring some pressure on his spouse\u2019s \nfamily members to gain influence or information from Applicant. People act in \nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a family member.8 \n \nThere is nothing untoward in the record about Applicant\u2019s relationships and \ncontacts with his spouse\u2019s family members in Kyrgyzstan. AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d has limited \napplicability nonetheless, given the evidence of ongoing contact his spouse has with her \nfather and some of her siblings. The foreign influence security concerns are not fully \nmitigated. \n \n \n                                                 \n8 As stated by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 08-10025 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009), \u201cApplication \nof the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people \nmay act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a \nfamily member.\u201d \n\n \n \n17 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).9 Furthermore, in weighing these whole-person factors in a foreign influence case, \nthe Appeal Board has held that: \n \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \nand circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s spouse is now a U.S. citizen, she has lived in the United \nStates only since September 2015. She and Applicant traveled to the Kyrgyz Republic for \na family reunion in October 2015, and she is not estranged from some close family \nmembers.  Perhaps at some future date, Applicant\u2019s family situation may present less of \na risk. At this time, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n                                                 \n9 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n \n \n18 \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Dorsey, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 31 January 2017, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the\n2\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 26\nConsisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-4, hearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant Exhibits\n1\n(AE) A-I. AE I was timely received post hearing. The record in this case closed 9 January 2018, when\nDepartment Counsel noted no objection to AE I.\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. However, on 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8\nJune 2017. My decision is the same under both guidelines.\n1\n01/17/2019\n\nSeptember 2017 and I convened a hearing 20 December 2017. DOHA received the\ntranscript 2 January 2018.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except SOR 1.i. He is a 30-year-old call\ncenter analyst employed by a U.S. defense contractor since December 2016.  He was  \n3\nemployed in less-well-paid positions since March 2004. He has previously had a\nfavorable background investigation in November 2007, when he worked for the\nGovernment. This is a periodic reinvestigation of that clearance (GE 1).\nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits 22\ndelinquent debts totaling over $35,000. The debts comprise $2,300 in delinquent traffic\ntickets (SOR 1.k-1.v), four delinquent education loans totaling $23,051, and six\ncommercial credit accounts. SOR 1.i appears as a current account in Applicant\u2019s April\n2014 credit report (GE 4) with a $335 balance; Applicant\u2019s November 2016 credit report\n(GE 3) reports that the account was charged off and transferred to another lender, but\nwith no stated balance.4\nApplicant reported five delinquent debts on his April 2014 clearance application\n(GE 1), including SOR 1.c, 1.e, 1.j, and 1.w. At the time, he claimed to have been\nmaking payments on SOR 1.c, and to have made payment arrangements with the other\ncreditors. He discussed these debts, and was confronted with the remaining SOR debts,\nduring a May 2014 interview with a Government investigator (GE 2), based on his April\n2014 credit report (GE 4). He repeated his claimed payments on SOR 1.c, and stated\nhis willingness and ability to address the SOR debts. In his Answer, Applicant claimed to\nbe working with a financial planner to address SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.j. He claimed to\nbe paying on SOR 1.g and 1.h, to have made a payment plan on SOR 1.c and 1.f, and\nto be in the process of contacting the SOR 1.e creditor. Except as noted below,\nApplicant has corroborated none of these claims.\nApplicant began a new repayment plan on SOR debt 1.c in February 2017, and\nis current on his payments through December 2017 (AE A). SOR debts 1.e and 1.f are\nto the same original creditor, with 1.f being held by a collection agent. The accounts\nhave different account numbers, so I cannot determine that the accounts are the same.\nApplicant claims to be making payments on 1.f, but the credit reports do not appear to\nconfirm that, and Applicant provided no corroboration. Similarly, Applicant claimed to be\nmaking payments on SOR debts 1.g, 1.h, and 1.w, but provided no corroboration. He\nclaimed (Tr. 25, 27) that he had disputed or paid the traffic tickets (SOR 1.k-1.v), but\nThis is a different contractor than originally sponsored his April 2014 clearance applicantion. At that time, he\n3\nwas employed at a lower wage than currently, and had been briefly unemployed from October to December\n2012. He was also unemployed from May to November 2016 (Tr. 29), during which time he drew\nunemployment.\nApplicant claimed that the account was paid (Answer), but provided no documentation. Applicant\u2019s December\n4\n2017 credit report (AE E).shows the account closed in September 2014.\n2\n\nprovided no documentation aside from the fact that the tickets do not appear on his\nDecember 2017 credit report (AE E).  The education loan at SOR 1.j was satisfied with\n5\na final payment in January 2018 (AE I).6\nFederally guaranteed student loans are difficult to track through credit reports\nbecause of the way the loans are issued, defaulted, consolidated, and rehabilitated, \nseldom with the same account numbers attached to the accounts. Applicant\u2019s April 2014\ncredit report shows six education loans, with complete account numbers, issued by the\ncreditor at SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. The entries report only the original loan amounts \nbecause each of the accounts was 120-days past due, and had been transferred to\nanother office. However, those original loan amounts correspond exactly to the six loans\nthat have been consolidated on Applicant\u2019s December 2017 account statement from the\nrehabilitation collection agent (AE B). The statement reflects no past-due amounts, and\nan upcoming $5.00 payment.  These six loans cannot be tracked through the\n7\nApplicant\u2019s November 2016 credit report (from which SOR 1.a, 1.b,  and 1.d are taken)\nbecause that credit report uses only the first four digits of the account number, which is\nthe same for all three accounts, bears no correlation to the original account numbers,\nand are the same original loan amounts\u2014only one of which matches an original loan\namount in AE B. Nevertheless, I conclude that six loans listed in AE B cover the SOR\namounts alleged in 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d.\nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his ignoring his financial obligations\nfor many years (Tr. 24). He particularly ignored his education loans, but was generally\nnot paying attention to his finances (Tr. 48-49). He did not begin to systematically\naddress his debts until after he received the SOR (Tr. 24, 69). He claims that he has\nbeen working hard on his credit since then (Tr. 26, 60).\nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a\nbudget, although he claimed to have one (Tr. 60). He claimed (Tr. 69) to have briefly\nlooked into credit counseling in February 2017, but did not really work with them. He\nclaimed to have worked with a credit repair company (Tr. 29) but had no documentation.\nThroughout his hearing, he claimed to have paid debts, or be paying debts, that he had\nSeveral of the SOR debts are still reported delinquent on this credit report. There are also new delinquent\n5\ndebts, which Applicant acknowledges (Tr. 57-58). I have not considered these debts on the merits of the case,\nbut they are relevant to show Applicant\u2019s state of mind.\nThe account number in AE I matches that on GE 3. Given the amount of the debt as of November 2016, I\n6\ninfer that Applicant was making payments on this account before the SOR was issued.\nWhen loans are placed in rehabilitation, the lender sets an arbitrarily-low monthly payment to ensure that the\n7\nloans can be successfully rehabilitated before the account is transferred to the collection agent\u2014with a\nsubstantially higher monthly payment. In this case, when he first contacted the creditor in February 2017, the\naccount was transferred to a rehabilitation collection agent, where Applicant made $5 monthly payments from\napproximately February to November 2017 (Tr. 45-46; 61). The account was then sent to a second\nrehabilitation collection agent (AE B), where the required $5 payment for December is the first of three $5\npayments required before the loans are sent to the permanent servicer, where the monthly payment is\nexpected to be $206 (Tr. 61-65).\n3\n\nreceipts for, but he never submitted them. Applicant\u2019s fiancee is somewhat aware of the\nSOR, and says Applicant is working on his financial problems. They share expenses\n(Tr. 80-85). Applicant claims $1,000 monthly positive case flow (Tr. 43). He provided no\nwork or character references, or evidence of community involvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.8\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant\ndelinquent debt, including Federally-guaranteed education loans, and largely ignored his\nfinancial obligations until after he received the SOR, despite having discussed these\ndebts with a Government investigator in May 2014.9\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n8\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history\n9\nof not meeting financial obligations;\n4\n\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations.\nThe conduct was recent, frequent, and the circumstances were not unusual.10\nMoreover, the circumstances of his financial problems were certainly within his control,\nand he was irresponsible in addressing his debts until after he received the SOR.11\n \nApplicant has neither claimed nor documented any credit or financial counseling,\nand there is a dearth of evidence to show that his financial problems have been\nresolved or are under control.  This failure of evidence precludes a conclusion that\n12\nApplicant has made a good-faith effort to address his debts.  The Government is not\n13\nthe collection agent of last resort. Applicants are expected to meet their financial\nobligations for moral reasons and legal requirements. Applicant\u2019s belated efforts to\naddress his education loans have reached the point where he is on the cusp of regular\npayments, but he has no established track record of payments. The few months of $5\npayments are not sufficient. With the possible exception of SOR debts 1.i and 1.j, all of\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to address his debts were belated. Moreover, he submitted no work\nor character evidence which might support a whole-person assessment to overcome the\nsecurity concerns raised by his conduct. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-h, k-w:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs i-j:\nFor Applicant\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n10\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n11\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . .  and there are clear indications\n12\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n13\nresolve debts.\n5\n\nConclusion\nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

Applicant had eight delinquent \naccounts that were either past due, charged off, or in collection, which totaled in excess \nof $54,000. Additionally, his parents and father-in-law are citizens and residents of \nCameroon. He has mitigated the foreign influence security concern, but has made \ninsufficient progress toward resolving his past-due debts. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 14, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline B, foreign \n02/28/2019\n\n \n2 \ninfluence and explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him.1  \n \nOn April 5, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On February 7, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on March 1, 2018. At the hearing, six Government exhibits (Ex. 1-6) \nand eight Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-H) were admitted into evidence without objection. The \nrecord was held open following the hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments should he chose to do so. Post-hearing documents were received and were \nadmitted into the record as Ex. K-U. Documents submitted by Applicant as attachments \nto his answer were considered. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on March 9, 2018. \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective \u201cfor \nall covered individuals\u201d on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility under the new AGs.2 \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nA risk assessment in this case necessitates administrative notice of facts \nconcerning Cameroon. Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice \nused for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated he was working to resolve the $10,928 \nautomobile loan (SOR 1.a) and $1,469 telephone service debt (SOR 1.b). He denied the \nremaining six delinquent accounts. He admitted he had relatives who were citizens and \n                                                          \n1 The DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, \n2006, for all adjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n \n2 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in \nthis case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf. \n  \n\n \n3 \nresidents of Cameroon. After a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, \nI make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old project specialist who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since September 2014. (Ex. 1, Tr. 27) He seeks to obtain a security clearance. \n(Ex. 1) He is married and has two children. (Ex.1, Tr. 59) He has never served in the U.S. \nmilitary. (Tr. 30) In February 2018, he received an applause award and monetary award \nfor his work contributions. (Ex. G) In December 2003, he received a Master\u2019s of Business \nAdministration (MBA) from an American university. (Ex. 1) \nApplicant was born in and was a citizen of Cameroon. In February 2000, Applicant \nvisited the United States when he came to the United States to further his education and \nto avoid violence and turmoil in Cameroon. (Tr. 31) At that time, Cameroon was politically \nunstable and had a high murder rate. (Ex. 3) He feared for his life in Cameroon and \napplied for political asylum in the United States. (Tr. 32) In 1997, he had been arrested \nfor protesting against the Cameroon government. (Tr. 33) His brother had also been \narrested. (Tr. 35) One of his cousins has been jailed indefinitely and Applicant has had \nfriends killed by the police. (Tr. 94) The government had been autonomous and a \ndictatorship. (Tr. 34) Cameroon has improved politically to the point Applicant visited \nCameroon for three weeks in 2013. That was his first visit since leaving the country in \n2000. (Ex. 3, Tr. 64) Cameroon does not accept dual citizenship. (Tr. 52)  \nApplicant\u2019s brother and his sister are Cameroon nationals. His other brother is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen and lives with him. (Ex. 3, Ex. D, Tr. 20) A couple of months after \nApplicant arrived in the United States, his brother arrived and two years later, his other \nbrother and sister arrived. (Tr. 19) His siblings were granted political asylum. (Ex. 3) One \nbrother lives in Canada and is a Canadian permanent resident pending Canadian \ncitizenship. (Tr. 56) His sister, a cosmetologist, lives in Arkansas and is a U.S. registered \nalien pending her citizenship. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 20, Tr. 54) She cannot apply for citizenship \nuntil she has been a registered alien for five years. (Tr. 53) In 2012 and 2013, he traveled \nto Canada to visit his brother and in 2013, he visited his family in Cameroon, as previously \nstated.  \nIn June 2012, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 32) \nHe feels loyalty to the United States and has no divided loyalty. (Tr. 97) His wife is a \nCameroon national and has U.S. alien registration. (Ex. 3, Tr. 25) His wife was already \nliving in the United States when they met in 2011. She had been previously jailed in \nCameroon for political protesting and was granted political asylum in the United States. \n(Tr. 63) They met in March 2011 and married in November 2011. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2) (Ex. 3) He \nanticipates his wife will become a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2020. (Ex. 3, Ex. D) She is a \nbusiness analyst working for an insurance company. (Tr. 2, Tr. 59) His two children were \nboth born in the United States. (Tr. 59) His father-in-law is a Cameroon national, retired \nfrom the Cameroon railway services, and is now a fireman. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 60) Applicant \nhas contact with his father-in-law by telephone twice a month. (Tr. 61) His wife has two \nsiblings living in Cameroon and three living in the United States. (Tr. 62) The record is \nsilent as to Applicant\u2019s contact with these individuals. \n\n \n4 \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are both Cameroon nationals and are retired civil \nservants. In her mid-30 to mid-40s, his mother worked ten years as a meteorologist for \nthe Cameroon government. (Ex. 2, Ex. 3, Tr. 45, Tr. 46) After retiring, she worked as a \nfinance manager for a private construction and security company and is now retired. (Ex. \n1, Ex. B, Tr. 25, Tr. 49) He has daily contact with her via email, text, or telephone calls \nwhen she is in Cameroon. (Ex. 3) She is currently visiting him in the United States. \nFor nine or ten years, Applicant\u2019s father, a Cameroon national, was one of thirteen \njustices on the Supreme Court of the Republic of Cameroon and, at one time, was \npresident of the high court. (Tr. 41). (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 25, Tr. 39) When he turned 65 years \nold, he retired.3 (Ex. B, Tr. 40) While his father served on the Supreme Court, it was the \nhighest court4 in the country. His father served as a judge in Cameroon in various \npositions for 40 years. (Tr. 38) Applicant has contact with his father twice a week via \nemail, text, or telephone calls. (Ex. 3, Tr. 51) His parents receive pensions from the \nCameroon government. (Tr. 66)  \nApplicant\u2019s parents have decided not to move to the United States because they \nwould not be able to cope with the life style in the United States and because his father\u2019s \narthritis would make winters in the United States unbearable for him. (Tr. 43) Applicant \nwould consider the area they live in Cameroon to be \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d (Tr. 44) His mother \nvisits him in the United States every two years and is currently visiting him, as previously \nstated. (Ex. 3, Ex. I) In March 2017, he applied for U.S. alien registration for his mother. \n(Ex. I-2, Ex. I-3, Tr. 25, Tr. 51) With alien registration, an individual must live in the United \nStates six months out of the year, which is another reason he did not apply for alien \nregistration for his father. (Tr. 52)  \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has four charged-off accounts totaling $23,175, three \ncollection accounts totaling $14,847, and he was $16,599 past due on another account. \nThe delinquent obligations totaled $54,621. He alleges that after completing his MBA in \n2003 and after he purchased his home, he started receiving letters stating he had \npurchased various goods, which he had not purchased. (Tr. 22, 29) When he located to \na job on the other coast, the company reviewed his credit and he discovered many flags \non his credit report. (Tr. 22) He disputed some of the accounts and made payments on \nothers. (Tr. 22) In 2008 or 2009, Applicant asserts he was the victim of identity theft. (Ex. \n2) He now employs two different credit monitoring services, neither of which are credit \ncounseling services. (Ex. 2) The services are to notify him of any irregular activity, dispute \nfraudulent activity, and alert him if his credit is pulled. (Tr. 85) He has had the service for \ntwo years. (Ex. I, K) \nIn 2011, Applicant\u2019s wife became ill and stopped working. She has now returned \nto working. The home they own is located in another state and is rented to tenants. (Tr. \n67) As of June 2015, Applicant owed approximately $218,000 on investment real estate. \n                                                          \n3 Exhibit A, written in French and not translated, states Applicant\u2019s father was due to retire because he was \n65 years old. (Tr. 93) \n \n4 Two or three years ago, Cameroon established a constitutional court, which supersedes the Supreme \nCourt. (Tr. 37)  \n\n \n5 \n(Ex. 2) At the hearing, he asserted he owed $209,000 on the property that has a fair \nmarket value of $250,000. He has put down a deposit on a new home being built where \nthey currently live. (Ex. F, Tr. 67) The new home costs $460,000. (Tr. 69) He intends to \nkeep his rental home after buying his new home. (Tr. 92) \nThe automobile debt listed in listed in SOR 1.a ($10,928) appears on Applicant\u2019s \nJanuary 2015 credit report. (Ex. 4) A previous automobile loan with the same lender was \nlisted as \u201cPays as Agreed\u201d with a high credit amount of $26,276 and a current balance of \n$21,784. The auto loan obtained in June 2011 required monthly payments of $598 for 72 \nmonths. (Ex. 4) He had purchased a used BMW, which developed problems. He traded \nit in, and in September 2012, and purchased an Acura using the same creditor for the \nnew auto loan. (Ex. I-5, Tr. 24) \nIn April 2016, Applicant could no longer afford the monthly car payments. (Ex. 3) \nEven though he had not missed any payments on the loan, he called the bank and had \nhis car voluntarily repossessed. (Ex. 3) At the time of the repossession, Applicant \nasserted he owed $18,000 on the loan and the vehicle was sold for $11,000 following the \nrepossession. (Ex. 3) In his July 2016 enhanced subject interview, he said he was in the \nprocess of setting up a repayment plan with the bank. In his July 2017 SOR response, he \nstated he was working on a resolution of this debt. His November 2016 credit report lists \n$5,626 past due on a $10,928 balance (SOR 1.a). (Ex. 6) At the hearing, he said he was \nworking with the creditor to reach a settlement agreement on the debt. (Tr. 71) He was \nunsure when a settlement agreement would be reached. (Tr. 87) His May 2018 credit \nreport reflects $12,590 charged off as a bad debt. (Ex. I-5)  \nApplicant asserted he was unable to continue with payment on the loan because \nhis wife had a large amount of medical bills. (Ex. 3) The nature of his wife\u2019s illness or the \ncost of treatment are not reflected in the record. (Tr. 88) He said he was able to satisfy all \nhis other financial obligations. \nDuring a June 2015 enhanced subject interview, Applicant stated that in 2002, a \nstudent loan (SOR 1.f, $5,516) was opened in his name and his brother\u2019s name by an \nunknown person (Ex. 2) On his January 2015 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) he stated the \u201cloan was originated by my Brother,\u201d and Applicant was \ndisputing the debt. (Ex. 1) He has disputed the loan since he found out about the loan in \n2008 or 2009. (Ex. 2) In his April 2017 SOR Response, he denied the debt, but said he \nwas working to resolve it. His January 2015 credit report states the account was opened \nin January 2002 with a high credit level of $6,325 and a balance of $7,374. The loan \nrequired monthly payments of $60 for 196 months. (Ex. 4) In March 2012, a debt of $5,516 \nwas charged off. (Ex. 4) Applicant asserts this was his brother\u2019s student loan and does \nnot know how or why it is attached to his credit report. (Tr. 78) This loan belongs to his \nbrother living in Canada. (Tr. 81) Applicant never co-signed on any student loans. (Tr. 78)  \nApplicant admits he has a student loan with the same company to pay for his MBA \neducation. That loan is current. (Tr. 78) His January 2015 credit report states the larger \nstudent loan status is \u201cPays as Agreed,\u201d and it had a $33,307 balance. That loan required \n$196 monthly payments for 300 months. (Ex. 4) His November 2016 credit report \n\n \n6 \nindicates the balance on the larger student loans is $30,510. (Ex. 5) As of December 31, \n2017, the balance on the student loans was $28,645. (Ex. I-4) His February 2018 credit \nreport lists the balance as $28,658 with no past-due amounts. (Ex. 6) His May 2018 credit \nreport lists it as \u201ccurrent\u201d with a balance of $28,114. (Ex. I-5)  \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2015 e-QIP he stated he owed $4,000 on a bank credit card \n(SOR 1.g, $4,557). (Ex. 1) He stated, \u201cI had a business in 2008 and as a result the \nbusiness accumulated some debt which I was the garantor [sic] and thus had to be liable.\u201d \n(Ex. 1) In his June 2015 interview he provided a different explanation of the charged-off \ncredit card debt. In the interview, he said the credit card account was opened in January \n2009 by an unknown individual as a result of identity theft. (Ex. 2) He told the investigator \nthat he did not know why it stated that he had a business in 2008, and as a result of \nbusiness debt accumulated, he was liable. (Ex. 2) He stated he did not know why the \ncase papers stated this. He asserted it was a fraudulent account, but asserted he paid it \nin March 2011 \u201cjust because he wanted it off of his credit report.\u201d (Ex. 2)  \nApplicant\u2019s January 2015 credit report lists two bank credit card accounts with the \ncreditor listed in SOR 1.g ($4,557), which is the debt referred to in the previous paragraph. \n(Ex. 4) He asserts one account is his, and he paid it, and the other account is a fraudulent \naccount. (Tr. 83) He asserted he could provide information on the account he paid. (Tr. \n83) No documents showing the debt had been paid were received. Both accounts were \nat times delinquent. One account opened in May 2006 had a high balance of $4,053 when \nit was closed by the grantor. (Ex. 4) The debt went to collection. The second account with \nthe same creditor was opened in August 2007 and $4,557 was charged off in September \n2014. (Ex. 4) He asserted he contacted the creditor, and they removed it from his credit \naccount. (Tr. 84) He provided no documentation supporting his assertion.  \nApplicant listed a federal credit union account debt of $7,300 on his e-QIP stating \nhe was disputing it and was working with a company to resolve the issue. (Ex. 1) The \ndebt (SOR 1.e, $13,263) was an automobile loan opened in September 2007 that \nrequired $353 monthly payments for 72 months. (Ex. 4) The high credit on the loan was \n$17,399. The delinquent obligation went to collection. (Ex. 4)  \nApplicant\u2019s January 2015 credit report lists two obligations to this federal credit \nunion, one in the amount of $13,263, listed as a collection account, and the other a $7,300 \naccount listed as \u201cPays as Agreed. The larger account was listed as \u201cclosed\u201d and the \nsmaller listed as \u201cAccount Closed by Grantor\u201d and charged off. (Ex. 4) The credit report \nlists both debts as \u201cDispute Resolved \u2013 Consumer Disagrees.\u201d (Ex. 4) He assets this was \na fraudulent account, that he worked with the credit union, and they removed it from his \ncredit report. (Tr. 76) He provided no documentation supporting his assertion.  \nThe credit card debt in SOR 1.h ($2,174) appears on Applicant\u2019s January 2015 \ncredit report listing that $2,174 had been charged off in December 2010. He asserts he \nreached a settlement with the creditor in 2011 and paid the debt. (Tr. 84) He provided no \ndocumentation supporting payment of the debt. He asserted he cannot \u201cget a hold of the \nbank to validate my account status. But this account was paid in full.\u201d (Ex. I-6) \n\n \n7 \nApplicant\u2019s November 2016 credit report lists a $1,469 telephone service collection \naccount (SOR 1.b) and a $115 cable television collection debt (SOR 1.c). (Ex. 6) He \nasserted the telephone account debt was a fraudulent account. He has had numerous \ncommunications with the telephone company and asserts the telephone company agreed \nthis was not his debt. (Tr. 72) His May 2018 credit report lists the account as closed and \nseriously past due date and assigned to a collection agency. (Ex. I-5) The debt also \nappears on his May 2018 credit report as closed and as a collection account. (Ex. I-5) As \nof August 2018, he was still working with the creditor to have the debt removed from his \ncredit report. (Ex. I) The debt is not reported by one credit reporting agency. (Ex. I-5) The \ncable debt arose when he moved. The account was paid and shows a zero balance on \nhis credit report. (Ex. I) \nOn Applicant\u2019s January 2015 e-QIP he listed $16,000 owed to the creditor listed in \nSOR 1.d ($16,599), but indicated it was caused by identity theft. On the e-QIP, he stated \nhe was working directly with all creditors and collection agencies listed on his credit profile \nto fix any pending issues. He said he was doing so to make sure it does not happen again \nand also to make sure his credit profile is correct. (Ex. 1) \nThe past-due account listed in SOR 1.d ($16,599) appears on Applicant\u2019s January \n2015 credit report listing the account as being opened in November 2011. It was listed as \nbeing 120 days or greater past due and in collection. (Ex. 4) The credit report also lists \nthe account as \u201cAccount in Dispute.\u201d In his June 2015 subject interview, he asserted this \ndebt was a fraudulent account opened by an unknown person. (Ex. 2) At the hearing, he \nsaid, \u201cI have no idea what this one \u2013 This one, too, was also a long time, and I just kept \ncalling them and denying [responsibility and stating] that it wasn\u2019t5 my debt, and \neventually, it was removed from my account.\u201d (Tr. 76) He provided no documentation \nsupporting this assertion.  \nApplicant makes regular contributions to his 401(k) retirement plan and has a \nbalance of approximately $53,000 in the plan. (Ex. H, Tr. 68) His wife has approximately \n$11,000 in her retirement plan. (Tr. 69) He has approximately $31,000 in savings. (Ex. I-\n1Tr. 69) Over the past four years he has spent approximately $30,000 working with his \nbrother to develop a computer application. (Tr. 90) His May 2018 credit report lists a \ncollection account with a zero balance. (Ex. I-5) \nPrior to closing arguments, Applicant was again informed of the importance of \nproviding documents to support his assertions of payment, settlement, or \nacknowledgement by the creditors that the delinquent obligations are not his. (Tr. 103) \n \nRepublic of Cameroon \nFrench Cameroon became independent in 1960 as the Republic of Cameroon. \nThe following year the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon voted to merge \nwith the new country to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The country has \ngenerally enjoyed stability, which has enabled the development of agriculture, roads, and \n                                                          \n5 Applicant probably meant to say he kept calling them and denying it \u201cwas\u201d his debt.  \n\n \n8 \nrailways, as well as a petroleum industry. Political power remains firmly in the hands of \nthe President. \nThe United States established diplomatic relations with Cameroon in 1960, \nfollowing the independence of the French-administered part of the country. Cameroon \nhas had just two presidents since independence. U.S. relations with Cameroon are \npositive, although from time to time they have been affected by concerns over human \nrights abuses and the pace of political and economic liberalization. Cameroon plays a key \nrole in regional stability and remains a strong regional partner with the United States in \ncountering terrorism in the Lake Chad Region. Cameroon is currently the United States\u2019 \n124th largest goods trading partner. \n \nInternational migration from Cameroon has been driven by unemployment \n(including fewer government jobs), poverty, the search for educational opportunities, and \ncorruption. The United States and Europe are preferred destinations. Cameroon has a \nlarge youth population, with more than 60% of the populace under the age of 25. \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to the North and \nFar North Regions and parts of the East and Adamawa Regions of Cameroon because \nof terrorist threats, the risk of violent crime, and civil unrest. (Cameroon Travel Warning, \nU.S. Embassy in Cameroon) Violent crime, such as armed robbery and carjacking, is \ncommon. Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal \nincidents. In the North and Far North Regions, as well as parts of East and Adamawa \nRegions, terrorists may attack with no warning, targeting local facilities, and places \nfrequented by Westerners. Kidnapping by terrorists and/or kidnapping for ransom are \nserious concerns in Cameroon. \n In Northwest and Southwest Regions, an Anglophone separatist movement has \nled to increased levels of violence. Armed clashes with the government and other acts of \nviolence have occurred. The Boko Haram terrorist group has actively targeted foreign \nresidents, tourists, and government leaders in the North and Far North Region. The U.S. \nEmbassy\u2019s ability to provide consular services in remote and rural areas of Cameroon is \nextremely limited and the U.S. Government has limited ability to provide emergency \nservices to U.S. citizens. \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n\n \n9 \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \n\n \n10 \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed-upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Security concerns are established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) because Applicant had eight delinquent debts which totaled in excess of \n$54,000. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \n\n \n11 \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nIt is incumbent on Applicant to provide sufficient documentation to support all \nmitigating claims or assertions he has made. This he failed to do. Other than payments \non Applicant\u2019s student loans, he has failed to document any payment on the SOR \ndelinquent obligations. In April 2016, Applicant voluntarily returned a vehicle to the \ncreditor and incurred a $10,928 debt (SOR 1.a). In July 2016, he said he was in the \nprocess of setting up a repayment plan. In his April 2017 SOR Response, he said he was \nworking on resolving the debt. At the March 2018 hearing, he asserted he was working \nwith the creditor to resolve the debt. He provided no documents supporting his \ncommunications with the creditor, a copy of a repayment plan, or evidence he has paid \nthe debt.  \n \nApplicant asserted the telephone service debt (SOR 1.b, $1,469) was a fraudulent \naccount. He never provided any documentation establishing it was a fraudulent account \nor a copy of any police report asking the police to investigate the fraud. He asserted he \nhad numerous communications with the telephone company and asserted the telephone \ncompany agreed it was not his debt. He never provided any documentation establishing \nthe creditor agreed it was not his debt. As the debt appears as a collection account on his \nMay 2018 credit report, and in August 2018, he said he was still working with the creditor \n\n \n12 \nto have the debt removed from his credit report. The $115 cable debt (SOR 1.c) was paid \nand is showing with a zero balance on his credit report. \n \nOn his January 2015 e-QIP, Applicant listed $16,000 owed to the creditor in SOR \n1.d ($16,599) and he indicated it was a fraudulent account. On his e-QIP, he asserted he \nwas working directly with all his creditors and collection agencies to fix any pending \nissues. At the hearing, he said he had no idea about the debt. He said he kept calling the \ncreditor, he denied the debt was his, and it was removed from his credit account. He \nprovided no documentation supporting the debt was fraudulent or documentation of \ncontacting the creditor.  \n \nApplicant asserted the credit union auto loan (SOR 1.e, $13,263) was also a \nfraudulent account. Again, he asserted he worked with the credit union lender, and it was \nremoved from his credit report. He provided no documentation supporting the debt was \nfraudulent or documentation of contacting the creditor. He disputed the student loan debt \n(SOR 1.f, $5,516) asserting it is his brother\u2019s student loan debt and claiming he does not \nknow why it appears on his credit report. Applicant provided documentation showing he \nis making timely payments on his student loans. His credit reports lists his student loan \nas being paid as agreed with no past-due amounts and with a balance consistently being \nreduced.  \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s January 2015 e-QIP, he stated he owed $4,000 on a bank credit \ncard due (SOR 1.g, $4,557) to business expenses but stated during his June 2015 \ninterview that the account was a fraudulent account opened by an unknown person. \nDuring the same interview, he said he paid the listed amount just to get it off his credit \nreport. At the hearing, he asserted he contacted the creditor, and the debt was removed \nfrom his credit account. He provided no documentation supporting the debt was \nfraudulent, that he had paid the debt, or that he contacted the creditor. He asserted the \ncredit card debt in SOR 1.h ($2,174) had been paid, but provided no documentation \nshowing payment. \n \nApplicant presented some mitigating information. He asserted he was unable to \npay some of his debts when his wife became ill and was unable to work. However, he \nfailed to provide sufficient information as to the nature, cost of the treatment, length of the \nillness, or when it occurred. He has equity in a home he owns and rents. He is current on \nhis student loan payments. He has $53,000 in his retirement plan and $31,000 in his \nsavings account. He recently obtained a loan on a $460,000 new home. Obtaining such \na loan indicates that the lender is sufficiently satisfied that Applicant is a good credit risk. \nThe household income, from his income and now that his wife has returned to work, is \nnot a part of the record.  \n \nThe mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(a) do not apply because the debts are numerous \nand remain unpaid. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply even though there are some factors that \nwere beyond his control such as his wife\u2019s illness and his assertion of identity theft. Even \nif the delinquent obligations Applicant asserts to be fraudulent, there are other delinquent \nobligations that remain unpaid. The small amount of documented payments shows he \nhas not acted responsibly under the circumstances to address his delinquent obligations. \n\n \n13 \nFor AG \u00b6 20(c) to apply there must be financial counseling, and clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control, neither of which have not been documented.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2015 e-QIP, his June 2015 interview, his July 2016 \ninterview, his April 2017 SOR Response, and at the hearing, he indicated he was \nattempting to established repayment plans for some of the SOR delinquent obligations. \nOther than payment on his student loans, which was not a delinquent SOR obligation, \nand the $115 cable bill, no payments had been made or evidence provided that \nrepayment plans existed. Although Applicant denies certain SOR delinquent obligations, \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because he has failed to document the fraudulent account \nassertions. AG \u00b6 20(e) requires Applicant to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. No documentation was received.  \n \nAn Applicant is not required to be debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all \ndebts immediately or simultaneously, but he is required to act responsibly given his \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan to address his delinquent obligations, \naccompanied by evidence of a serious intent to effectuate the plan. This has not been \ndone. \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about foreign influence as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \n\n \n14 \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nIn June 2012, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He came to the United \nStates as a student. He feared for his life in Cameroon and applied for political asylum in \nthe United States. In 1997, he had been arrested for protesting against the Cameroon \ngovernment. His wife and brother had also been arrested for political protesting. One of \nhis cousins has been jailed indefinitely and Applicant has had friends killed by the police.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife and sister were born in Cameroon and are U.S. registered aliens \nliving in the United States pending their U.S. citizenship. He anticipates his wife will \nbecome a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2020. His two children are U.S residents, having \nbeen born in the United States. His one brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen and his other \nbrother lives in Canada and is a Canadian permanent resident pending Canadian \ncitizenship. Applicant feels loyalty to the United States and has no divided loyalty. \nCameroon does not accept dual citizenship.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a Cameroon national who is a retired civil servant. In her mid-\n30 to mid-40s, she worked ten years as a meteorologist for the Cameroon government. \nHis mother, who is currently visiting him, is a U.S. registered alien pending her citizenship. \nHe has frequent contact with his parents in Cameroon. Applicant\u2019s father, a Cameroon \nnational, is a retired justice of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Cameroon. His \nparents receive pensions from the Cameroon government.  \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a Cameroon national, retired from the Cameroon \nrailway services, and is now a fireman. Applicant has contact with his father-in-law by \ntelephone twice a month. His wife has two siblings living in Cameroon and three living in \nthe United States. However, the record is silent as to how much, if any, contact Applicant \nor his spouse have with his wife\u2019s siblings.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties with his parents living in Cameroon, are not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his spouse has a close \nrelationship with even one relative, living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient \nto create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise \nof classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, their immediate family members. See generally ISCR Case No. 01-03120, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). \u201c[A]s a matter of common sense \nand human experience, there is [also] a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of \naffection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-17673 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 2, 2009) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 \n\n \n15 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002)). This concept is the basis of AG \u00b6 7(e). Indirect influence \nfrom his parents and his spouse\u2019s father living in Cameroon could result in a security \nconcern. See ISCR Case No. 09-05812 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 2011) (finding presence in \na country of close family members, viewed in light of that country\u2019s troubles with terrorism \nand its human rights abuses, and his sharing living quarters with a person (his spouse) \nhaving foreign family contacts, establish the \u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(b) and 7(e)).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his parents could create a concern about Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology\u201d and possibly his desire to help \nhis parents living in Cameroon. It is possible intelligence officials or other entities in \nCameroon wanting to expose Applicant to coercion, could exert pressure on his parents \nliving in Cameroon. Applicant would then be subject to coercion through his parents and \nclassified information could potentially be compromised. This is countered by him, his \nwife, brother, and cousin having been imprisoned by the Cameroon government for \npolitical protesting. Serving imprisonment for political protesting does not endear one to \nthe government that imprisons him or her.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially \nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 \nDOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives or terrorists from Cameroon \nseek or have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or \nsiblings living in Cameroon, nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility \nin the future.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists three conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n\n \n16 \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) apply. Applicant has frequent contact with his parents living \nin Cameroon and less frequent contact with his father-in-law. His mother and father\u2019s \npast employment with the Cameroon government makes reviewing the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns critical. Applicant\u2019s wife and siblings are not a security concern. His \none brother is a U.S. naturalized citizen. His other brother is a lives in Canada and is a \nCanadian permanent resident pending Canadian citizenship. His wife, sister, and mother \nare U.S. registered aliens. There is little likelihood that his relationships with his wife or \nsiblings could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has significant connections \nto the United States. Applicant, his children, and his brother are citizens and residents of \nthe United States. His spouse, sister, and mother are registered aliens waiting to become \nnaturalized citizens. He left Cameroon and received refugee status, as did his wife and \nsiblings. In 2003, he received his MBA from an American university. He owns one home \nin the United States and his received a loan to purchase a second home in the United \nStates.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with family living in Cameroon. \nThere is no evidence, however, that terrorists, criminals, the Cameroon Government, or \nthose conducting espionage have approached or threatened Applicant or his siblings \nliving in Cameroon to coerce Applicant for classified or sensitive information. While the \nU.S. Government does not have any burden to prove the presence of such evidence, if \nsuch record evidence were present, Applicant would have a heavier evidentiary burden \nto mitigate foreign influence security concerns.  \n\n \n17 \nIn sum, Applicant has significant connections to the United States. He came to the \nUnited States at age 20 and is now 40 years old. The foreign influence security concerns \nare mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. An administrative judge must evaluate \nan Applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in the whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s parents and father-in-law \nlive in Cameroon. His wife, sister, and mother are U.S. registered aliens waiting for the \npermanent U.S. citizenship. His one brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen and his other \nbrother is a Canadian permanent resident living in Canada pending Canadian citizenship. \nHis children are U.S. citizens. The foreign influence security concerns are mitigated by \nApplicant\u2019s significant connections to the United States.  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He has known about the \nGovernment\u2019s concern about his finances since his June 2015 and July 2016 interviews, \nand the March 2017 SOR. The $115 cable bill has been addressed and he is current on \nhis student loan payments, which were not alleged as delinquent in the SOR. He asserts, \nbut failed to document, he has been in contact with his creditors. He has not shown that \nhe acted responsibly to address his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s failure to make greater \nprogress resolving his SOR debts shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and \nraises unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See AG \u00b6 18. The issue is not simply whether all Applicant\u2019s debts \nare paid\u2014it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold \na security clearance. See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(b). \n \n\n \n18 \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance due to financial considerations. The determination of an individual\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but \nis based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence \npresented. Under Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not warranted. In the \nfuture, Applicant may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, the unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nIn the future, with a track record of addressing his delinquent financial obligations, he may \nwell be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Security Concern:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:   \n  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.h:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nForeign Influence Security Concern: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:   \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Blazewick, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Leon J. Schachter, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 4 January 2017, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the\n2\nConsisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-4, hearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant Exhibits\n1\n(AE) A-M. AE L was admitted for the sole purpose of identifying AE A-K for the record (Tr.17-18). AE M was\ntimely received post hearing. The record in this case closed 30 January 2018, when Department Counsel\nnoted no objection to AE M. I amended the SOR to add the March 2018 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, based\non Applicant\u2019s AE I (Tr. 90-92).\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. However, on 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8\nJune 2017. My decision is the same under both guidelines.\n1\n02/26/2019\n\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 27\nSeptember 2017 and I convened a hearing 5 April 2018. DOHA received the transcript\n17 April  2018.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 63-year-old aircraft mechanic\nemployed by a U.S. defense contractor since June 1992.  He has previously had\n3\nfavorable background investigations in July 2002 and August 2013. The genesis of the\ncurrent background investigation is unclear (GE 1).\nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits eight\ndelinquent debts totaling over $99,000. The debts comprise $200 in delinquent traffic\ntickets (SOR 1.k-1.l),  a $2,700 state tax lien (SOR 1.j),  four delinquent medical\n4\n5\naccounts totaling nearly $1,400 (SOR 1.f-1.I),  and a delinquent education loan totaling\n6\nover $95,000 (SOR 1.e).  The SOR also alleges, Government and Applicant exhibits\n7\nestablish, and Applicant admits filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection five times\nbetween August 1998 and March 2018 (SOR 1.a-1.d and 1.m). The March 2018 filing\nwas pending approval (AE I); the October 2013 filing was converted to a Chapter 7\npetition in March 2014, and discharged in November 2014. The August 1998, October\n2000, and September 2011 petitions were dismissed in October 1999, June 2001, and\nMarch 2013, respectively.  Applicant completed the bankruptcy-required financial\n8\ncounseling in February 2018 [AE C(2)], and another financial counseling in March 2018\n[AE C(1)]. His tentative Chapter 13 plan anticipated the creditors\u2019 meeting later in April\nHe has also been self-employed in the vending machine business since April 2010.\n3\nPaid by Applicant on 2 February 2017 (Answer, AE H). The amounts and creditor are an exact match.\n4\nAE G, a 26 February 2018 letter from the state tax authority, reflects an agreement to pay $121.50 toward\n5\na $716 tax liability. However, the account number listed is not the same as that listed on GE 2 and 3 for SOR\ndebt 1.j. Moreover, Applicant did not document any of the required payments for February and March 2018.\nApplicant paid SOR 1.i on 30 January 2017 (AE F). He paid SOR 1.h on 30 January 2017 as well (Answer,\n6\nAE E). He paid SOR 1.g the same day (Answer). He offered AE M(10) as proof that SOR 1 f was paid on 15\nFebruary 2017, but the amounts do not match and GE 3 contains no account number for the account.\nAE M(14) reflects that Applicant entered into a rehabilitation agreement on 24 June 2014 in which he was\n7\nto pay $5.00 monthly beginning 25 June 2016, and continuing until he made nine voluntary and on time\npayments within a ten month period..AE D confirmed his entry into the program.  AE M(9) shows that he made\n13 $5.00 payments between June 2017 and February 2017, at which point the rehabilitated loan was\napparently purchased by another lender in accordance with the rehabilitation agreement. The outstanding\nbalance for the loan when it went into rehabilitation was $92,421.46, almost the amount listed on Applicant\u2019s \nMarch 2018 petition (AE I, M(15) under a different creditor, presumably the successor-in-interest.\nThe August 1998 and October 2000 petitions were dismissed when Applicant received insurance settlements\n8\nwhich allowed him to repay his creditors. The September 2011 petition was dismissed when Applicant was\nable to gather the funds necessary to repay his creditors.\n2\n\n2018, with confirmation in May 2018. The plan called for $700 monthly payments, and\nApplicant made the first required payment the week after the hearing [AE M(12)].\nApplicant reported his two most recent (at the time) bankruptcy petitions on his\nJune 2015 clearance application (GE 1). He resolved approximately $60,000 in debt in\nhis September 2011 Chapter 13 petition, and resolved approximately $70,000 in debt in\nhis November 2014 Chapter 7 discharge. His pending Chapter 13 petition lists\napproximately $135,000 in unsecured claims, of which over $93,000 are an education\nloan and another nearly $9,000 are to state and Federal tax authorities. Neither of these\ndebts is likely to be dischargeable. Applicant documented that he had an installment\nplan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and made his $100 July 2017 payment as\nrequired [AE M(11)]. However, his balance at the time was over $9,000.  \n9\nApplicant\u2019 financial problems predate his August 1998 Chapter 13 bankruptcy\npetition. He and his wife have been plagued with a seemingly endless string of\naccidents, injuries, and illnesses.  The August 1998 petition was precipitated by an\n10\nautomobile accident that left her unable to work for two years (Tr. 25), but was\ndismissed in October 1999 when the case settled and Applicant was able to pay his\ncreditors. Similarly, the October 2000 petition was precipitated by another accident that\nleft his wife unable to work for a long time; additionally, Applicant had an illness that\nrequired a week in the hospital. However, the petition was dismissed in June 2001 when\nthe case settled and Applicant was able to pay his creditors.\nNevertheless, their medical adventures continued: in 2003, their minor child had\na burst appendix and was hospitalized for three weeks; in 2004, Applicant\u2019s wife had\nadditional knee surgery from the earlier accident, and Applicant had pneumonia. He\nmissed time at work, which was unpaid because he had used all his accumulated time\noff. Applicant\u2019s wife had another accident in 2005, had major breast cancer surgery in\n2007, costing $30,000 out of pocket, and another accident. She had more knee surgery\nin 2008 and a knee replacement in 2009.\nApplicant had a collapsed lung in 2010, three surgeries to repair it, and six more\nweeks out of work. In 2011, he had another bout of pneumonia, and was out of work\nanother three weeks. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy again in September 2011, but\nwas able to catch up on his payments to his creditors and have the petition discharged\nin March 2013 (Tr. 53).  Meanwhile, in 2012, he developed knee problems himself\nwhich required surgery. He filed another Chapter 13 petition in October 2013, converted\nit to a Chapter 7 petition in March 2014, when he realized that he would not be able to\nmake the required plan payments, and was discharged of his dischargeable debt in\nNovember 2014.\nHe listed $10,000 IRS debt on his March 2018 Chapter 13 petition.\n9\nApplicant\u2019s wife experienced serious medical issues beginning in 1992, when she had three accidents; she\n10\nhad another serious accident in 1994, and again in 1997, leading to surgery in 1998 (Tr. 45-46).\n3\n\n Applicant\u2019s financial reprieve was short lived. In 2014, his wife tripped in the\ndriveway, smashed her elbow, and required three surgeries to repair the damage.\nApplicant took time off from work to care for her. Their out-of-pocket expenses were\n$40,000-50,000. In 2015, she had another accident, which required her fourth neck\nsurgery to repair. Those out-of-pocket expenses ran $20,000-$30,000. She later\ncontracted pneumonia in 2016, which devolved into bronchitis, incurring more medical\nbills. Applicant was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2017, but the cancer was detected\nearly, and his prognosis is good (Tr. 37-38). In 2018, Applicant\u2019s wife had hip\nreplacement surgery, but hurt herself while in rehabilitation, which required a second\nsurgery, and developed an infection which required a third surgery; the expected out-of-\npocket expense is $30,000.\nApplicant documented his credit and financial counseling, and submitted a\nFebruary 2018 personal financial statement (PFS) showing $39 positive monthly cash\nflow (AE J). In fairness to Applicant, he overlooked additional sources of income [AE\nM(5)-M(8)]. His March 2018 Chapter 13 petition shows $700 positive monthly cash flow.\nApplicant\u2019s work and character references [AE J, M(13)] have both known him for many\nyears, are aware of Applicant\u2019s financial problems, and hold clearances themselves.\nThey consider Applicant honest and trustworthy, and recommend him for his clearance,\nnotwithstanding his financial troubles.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\n4\n\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\nGovernment.11\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Setting aside for a moment\nApplicant\u2019s first four bankruptcy petitions, Applicant had over $4,000 in delinquent debt\nthat he did not address until after he received the SOR, a $95,000 delinquent education\nloan which he began rehabilitating before the SOR was issued, but for which he\nsubmitted no current status, and a March 2018 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition which\nwas still pending creditors\u2019 input and court approval.12\nThe mitigating conditions for financial considerations provide insufficient help to\nApplicant. The conduct was recent, frequent, and the circumstances were only unusual\nto the extent that he has been plagued with more than his fair share of unfortunate\nluck.  That said, the circumstances of his financial problems were certainly largely\n13\nbeyond his control, and he has been responsible in addressing his debts up to a point.  \n14\n     \nBankruptcy, whether Chapter 13 or Chapter 7, is a legitimate means of obtaining\na new start when circumstances beyond your control overwhelm your ability to pay. And\nthe frequency of bankruptcies is not necessarily disqualifying in the absence of self-\ndealing or unscrupulous behavior. There is no evidence that either Applicant or his wife\nhave so behaved. Consequently, the first four bankruptcy petitions are easily resolved in\nApplicant\u2019s favor, as the first three petitions were dismissed when he satisfied his\ncreditors, and the fourth represented a not-unusual progression from Chapter 13 to\nChapter 7 and a new financial start (SOR 1.a-1.d).\n \nWhat remains is the Applicant\u2019s handling of his SOR debt, and his pending\nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition. Applicant documented that he satisfied SOR debts !.f-\n1.l after he received the SOR. Applicant documented that he initiated, and substantially\ncompleted, a rehabilitation program on his $95,000 delinquent education loan (SOR\n1.e). He appears to have made the required rehabilitation payments by March 2017. But\nhe documented no loan status after March 2017, at which point the holder of the loan\nwould have attempted to obtain a rehabilitation loan lender in accordance with the\nrehabilitation agreement. His March 2018 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition (AE I) lists two\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n11\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a\n12\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n13\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n14\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n5\n\neducation loan accounts with a creditor who could be a successor-in-interest to the\nSOR creditor, one with a $93,632 balance, one with an unknown balance. Under the\nterms of his rehabilitation agreement, if this loan has been defaulted again, it cannot be\nrehabilitated a second time. Finally, the bankruptcy petition itself is still pending\nimportant steps. As with the other bankruptcies, the mitigating conditions only get the\nApplicant so far. The petition is not distant, not infrequent, and occurred under\ncircumstances capable of repetition. On the other hand, the petition was due again to\ncircumstances beyond his control, and filing the petition can be considered a\nresponsible action under the circumstances. Where Applicant falls short is his inability to\nshow progress on the petition. While he made the first contemplated payment under the\nas-yet-unapproved plan, that payment is insufficient to establish a favorable track\nrecord.\n \nWhile Applicant has documented credit and financial counseling, it is too soon to\nconclude that his financial problems have been resolved or are under control.  This\n15\nfailure of evidence precludes a conclusion that Applicant has made a good-faith effort to\naddress his debts because he cannot show substantial evidence that he is adhering to\nhis effort.  Applicant\u2019s timely efforts to address his education loans had reached the\n16\npoint where he was on the cusp of regular payments, but he has no established track\nrecord of payments. The few months of $5 payments are not sufficient, without showing\nwhat happened to the loan after March 2017. Applicant\u2019s efforts to address his debts\nwere belated. Moreover, his two favorable work or character references are insufficient\nto support a whole-person assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his\ncurrent financial situation. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied all five SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 and 9.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since April of 2016. (GX 1 at page 9.) He is married, and has three children. (TR at page 13 line 25 to page 14 line 16.) Applicant attributes his past financial difficulties to a substantial cut in his pay, and to medical issues for both his spouse and his 14-year old daughter.

(Answer.) The case was originally assigned to another \nadministrative judge, but reassigned to me on February 20, 2018. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 28, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for March 19, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \n                                                          \n1 I considered the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new \nAdjudicative Guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. My decision would be the same if the case was \nconsidered under the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006. \n\n \n2 \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and called one witness. Applicant \npresented one document, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppX) A and admitted \ninto evidence. The record was left open until April 19, 2018, for receipt of additional \ndocumentation. On April 18, 2018, Applicant presented an additional packet of \ndocuments, which I marked AppX B and admitted into evidence. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on March 26, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied all five SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 9.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since April of 2016. (GX 1 at \npage 9.) He is married, and has three children. (TR at page 13 line 25 to page 14 line \n16.) Applicant attributes his past financial difficulties to a substantial cut in his pay, and \nto medical issues for both his spouse and his 14-year old daughter. (TR at page 25 line \n23 to page 26 line 11.) He is addressing the Government\u2019s concerns, listed below, and \nlives within his family budget. (TR at page 332 lines 5~11, and AppX B the last three \npages.) \n \n \n1.a. Applicant is making monthly payments of $360 towards the past-due debt to \nCreditor A, which has now been reduced to about $6,298. (TR at page 20 line 22 to \npage 25 line 2.) This is evidenced by documentation from Creditor A. (GX B at page 2.) \n \n \n1.b.  Applicant is making monthly payments of $101 towards the past-due debt to \nCreditor B, which has now been reduced to about $3,189. (TR at page 26 line 15 to \npage 27 line 13.) This is evidenced by documentation from Creditor B. (GX B at page \n4.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant is making monthly payments of $130 towards the past-due debt to \nCreditor C, which has now been reduced to about $2,054. (TR at page 27 line 4 to page \n30 line 3.) This is evidenced by documentation from Creditor C. (GX A.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant is making monthly payments of $80 towards another past-due debt \nto Creditor B, which has now been reduced to about $2,607. (TR at page 32 line 18 to \npage 33 line 4.) This is evidenced by documentation from Creditor B. (GX B at page 3.) \n \n \n1.e. Applicant has paid the alleged past-due medical debt to Creditor E, as \nevidenced by documentation from Creditor E. (AppX B at page 5.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant had significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant is addressing, through making monthly payments, all but one of the \nalleged past-due debts that are of concern to the Government. The other alleged past-\ndue debt he has paid. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has a distinguished history of \nworking in the defense industry and is respected by his supervisor. (TR at page 35 line \n16 to page 37 line 1.) He performs well at his job.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 56-year-old flight engineer and project manager who has worked for a defense contractor since August 2000 and seeks to retain his security clearance. (Ex. 1, Ex. E, Tr. 20) From September 1981 through September 1985, he honorably served in the U.S. Air Force.

Applicant pled guilty to a \nmisdemeanor offense of pointing a weapon at others and received a three year deferred \nsentence. He has mitigated the criminal conduct and personal conduct security \nconcerns. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 9, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct, and \nexplaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue security clearance eligibility for him.1  \n1 The DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \n04/02/2019\n\n \n2 \nOn May 30, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). On February 7, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a \nhearing that was conducted on February 28, 2018.  \n \nFive Government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and five Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-E) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Records submitted by Applicant as \nattachments to his answer were considered. Applicant testified, as reflected in a \ntranscript (Tr.) received on March 9, 2018. I held the record open after the hearing for \nApplicant to submit additional documents. Following the hearing, the Order of Dismissal \nwas admitted as Ex. F. \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence \nissued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information \nor eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs \nand are effective \u201cfor all covered individuals\u201d on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I \nhave evaluated Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted a felony arrest for Pointing of a \nFirearm (SOR 1.a), which was also alleged under the personal conduct guideline. After \na thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 56-year-old flight engineer and project manager who has worked \nfor a defense contractor since August 2000 and seeks to retain his security clearance. \n(Ex. 1, Ex. E, Tr. 20) From September 1981 through September 1985, he honorably \nserved in the U.S. Air Force. (Ex. 1, Tr. 22) He had no overseas deployments when on \nactive duty, but spent three and a half years in Saudi Arabia with his contractor job. (Tr. \n24) He has been married 26 years and has no children. (Ex.1, Tr. 24) \n \nOn January 29, 2015, Applicant was arrested for felony pointing of a firearm. (Ex. \n5, Ex. A) That evening, his sleep was interrupted by his neighbor\u2019s four barking dogs. \n(Ex. B) Applicant lives in a gated community of 100 homes all on one-and-a-half acre \nlots. (Tr. 27) There was a history of complaints about the barking dogs. The dogs\u2019 \nbarking was loud enough to disturb one neighbor, not the Applicant, who lived six \nhundred feet away and the noise was separated from his residence by a heavily \nwooded yard. (Ex. B) The complaint dogs\u2019 owner put threatening notes on people\u2019s \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on September \n1, 2006. \n \n2 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision \nin this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf. \n  \n\n \n3 \ndoors when a different neighbor complained about the barking. (Tr. 28) When \nApplicant\u2019s next-door neighbors complained to the dogs\u2019 owner about the noise, the \ndogs\u2019 owner dropped off a box fan at the complaining neighbor\u2019s home and said he \nheard \u201cwhite noise\u201d helps to reduce the sound of barking dogs. (Tr. 28)  \n \nSince 2012, the police had responded four times from complaints from the \nneighbors about the barking dogs. (Ex. 6) The barking dogs had resulted in Applicant\u2019s \nneighbor being ticketed for disturbing the peace. (Ex. B)The Applicant\u2019s neighbor had \ngone to court to respond to a complaint over his barking dogs and was fined by the city. \n(Tr. 28) As a result the owner frequently placed two of the dogs in a heated warehouse \nnear the house. (Ex. 6, Ex. B) The move failed to end the barking. (Ex. 6, Ex. B) \n \nThe back of Applicant\u2019s property fronts onto the dog owner\u2019s property. (Tr. 29) \nOn a previous occasion when Applicant\u2019s neighbor\u2019s dogs were constantly barking, \nApplicant called the police and was told the police would respond to loud party noise but \ndo not respond to animal disturbances. (Tr. 28) He was told that he would have to wait \nuntil the next morning to call animal control. (Tr. 28) Applicant stated the dogs would \nbark every two seconds for as long as eight hours straight. (Tr. 28)  \n \nOn January 29, 2015, at 8:20 pm, the dogs started barking. (Tr. 29) Applicant \nwent to the dog owner\u2019s home initially to leave a note complaining about the barking \ndogs. At that time, he did not know if anyone was home at the dog owner\u2019s home3. \nWhen the owner answered the door, Applicant angrily complained that the neighbor\u2019s \ndogs had kept Applicant awake the previous night. (Ex. 5) The owner initially said this \nwas the first time the dogs were barking, but later acknowledged he had failed to put the \ndogs in the barn the previous night. (Ex. B, Tr. 31) When Applicant challenged the \nowner about being fined after being taken to court over the dogs\u2019 barking, the owner \nbecame upset. (Tr. 31)  \n \nAfter Applicant stated his complaint, he returned to his car. At that time the dogs\u2019 \nowner followed him to his car. Both individuals were swearing. Applicant got into his car \nwhen the dogs\u2019 owner struck the hood of Applicant\u2019s car three times and dented the \nhood of Applicant\u2019s car. (Ex. 6, Tr. 17, Tr. 33)  \n \nThe individual\u2019s front house light was not working and the only light came from \nApplicant\u2019s car head lights. (Ex. 5, Ex. A, Tr. 16) At that time the neighbor had \nsomething metallic in his hand, which turned out to be a cell phone. But in the dark, \nApplicant could only identify it as metallic. (Tr. 16) Applicant got out of his car as his \nneighbor continued to approach him. Thinking the neighbor to be armed, as his \nneighbor approached, Applicant drew a handgun and pointed it at his neighbor yelling \nfor him to stop. Applicant has a concealed carry permit and says he drew his firearm out \nof self-defense. (Ex. 6) After exchanging additional words, Applicant got back in his car, \n                                                          \n3 Applicant stated that in his neighborhood individuals work nights or are sometime gone for multiple days due to \ntheir jobs so he did not know if the dog owner was home. (Tr. 30)  \n \n\n \n4 \ndrove home, and called the police. (Ex. 6) Three hours prior to the incident, Applicant \nhad a glass of wine with dinner. (Tr. 19)  \n \nThe dogs\u2019 owner said he followed Applicant to his car to make sure Applicant left. \n(Ex. 6) The dog owner says he messed up when he struck Applicant\u2019s vehicle, at which \ntime Applicant got out of his car. (Ex. 6) The dog owner told police he would have put \nhis dogs in the barn had Applicant asked. (Ex. 6) As Applicant was leaving, he said he \nwas going to call 911 and the dogs\u2019 owner said it would be a race to see who called \nfirst. The neighbor asked his wife to call 9-1-1 when he entered his home and to get his \nweapon. (Ex. B) Applicant called 911 when he got home, told the police about the \nincident, said he had drawn his weapon, and gave the police his address. (Tr. 33) He \nwas arrested that night and the gun confiscated. The gun was never returned to \nApplicant. (Tr. 39) His concealed carry permit was returned to the issuing authority. (Tr. \n50)  \n \nAfter the incident, the barking stopped. (Tr. 41) The dogs were rescue dogs and \nafter the newspaper article and television news about the incident, the dog rescue came \nand took the dogs from the home. (Tr. 41) Since the incident, Applicant has had no \ninteraction with the dogs\u2019 owner. (Tr. 41)  \n \nThe district attorney (DA) assigned to the case said he would drop the charges if \nApplicant wrote a letter of apology to the dogs\u2019 owner. (Tr. 36) Applicant refused to do \nso. The DA also suggested Applicant consider anger management or counseling. \nApplicant said he would go only if the dog owner also went. (Tr. 40) Two years later, a \ndifferent district attorney was handling the matter. Applicant initially paid his attorney \n$4,000 and was informed that an additional $8,000 would be required to take the matter \nto a jury trial, for a total of $12,000. (Tr. 9, SOR Response) The potential cost was a \nfactor in deciding to accept the district attorney\u2019s offer of a guilty plea to a misdemeanor. \nAlso a weighing factor was the stress the matter had caused Applicant and his wife. (Tr. \n36) When the plea was made, it had already cost him $7,0004. (Tr. 14, Tr. 36)  \n \nOn November 23, 2016, Applicant, after pleading guilty to the misdemeanor of \npointing a weapon at others, he was order to pay a $50 fine, a $50 Victim's \nCompensation Assessment (VCT), and $83 in court costs. His finding of guilty was \ndeferred for three years. (Ex. 4) He was required to complete one year of supervised \nprobation5 and two additional years of unsupervised probation. (Tr. 37) None of the \ncourt documents present in the record indicate a community service requirement. After \n                                                          \n4 In addition to the $4,000 attorney\u2019s fees, Applicant paid $50 for warrant of arrest, $25 for court \ninformation system revolving fund, $75 bond fee to the court (the bondsman\u2019s fee for the $4,000 bond is \nnot part of the record), and $200 in additional court fees and assessments. (Ex. 4) The bond was \ndecreased at arraignment. (Ex. 4) Applicant\u2019s cost between these fees, assessments, and costs and the \n$7,000 claimed by Applicant is not part of the record. \n  \n5 Even though there was one year of supervised probation, Applicant never saw the probation officer. \nWithin a week of his plea, he called the probation officer and was told he did not have to come in to the \nprobation office and that he should keep the probation officer informed if he moved, changed \nemployment, or if his telephone number changed.  \n\n \n5 \ncompleting the deferred sentence, Applicant\u2019s record would be expunged. (Tr. 14) \nWhen Applicant made the decision to plead guilty to the misdemeanor, he had no idea \nthat doing so would have affected his security clearance. (Tr. 14) \n \nAs of February 2018, Applicant had completed 130 hours of community service \nat a non-profit organization that helped neglected, abused, and homeless dogs. (Ex. D) \nThe president and founder of the organization stated Applicant was very hard working \nand a dedicated volunteer who always put in the best possible effort. (Ex. D) In May \n2018, Applicant had met all the conditions regarding the supervised probation and \ncommunity service, and having served more than half of the probationary period, \nformally requested early termination of his unsupervised probation.  \n \nIn January 2019, Applicant dismissed his original attorney and hired a new \nattorney, at a cost of an additional $4,000, in an attempt to terminate the unsupervised \nprobation early. On March 22, 2019, the Motion to Accelerate Deferred Sentence and \nDismiss Case was sustained. (Ex. V) On March 22, 2019, an Order of Dismissal was \nsigned, which ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the case against him be dismissed. \nNow that the deferred sentence has been successfully completed, his record will be \nexpunged. \n \nApplicant realizes he acted inappropriately and wishes he had never gone to the \ndogs\u2019 owner\u2019s home. The frustration due to lack of sleep and the police not responding \nto barking dogs contributed to his inappropriate actions. (Tr. 42) He makes no excuses \nfor his actions. His intent was to leave a note and when he saw the dogs\u2019 owner was \nhome, it was his intent to tell him to quiet his dogs, and then he intended to leave. (Tr. \n42) Obviously, it did not work out as planned. \n \nThe senior logistics manager for the DoD contractor was Applicant\u2019s supervisor \nfor two and a half years, and he described Applicant as a very dedicated, detailed, and \npassionate about the work he performs on aircraft upgrades. (Ex. E) He stated \nApplicant has strong morals that drive his decisions and highly recommends Applicant. \n(Ex. E) The project manager stated Applicant was one of the better project management \nspecialists in the company. (Ex. E) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n\n \n6 \n2(a), the adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful \nweight of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \nwhole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n\n \n7 \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \n \nIn January 2015, Applicant was charged with carrying a firearm while under the \ninfluence and felony pointing a firearm. He pled no contest to a reduced misdemeanor \ncharge and received a deferred disposition. He was placed on probation for three years \nuntil November 2019. The disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 31 (a) applies. AG \u00b6 31(b) \ndoes not apply because there is no \u201cpattern\u201d of offenses\u2014he committed one offense. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c), \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation,\u201d was applicable as of \nthe issuance of the SOR in May 2017 because Applicant was then on unsupervised \nprobation. It no longer applies because he successfully petitioned for an Order of \nDismissal. He made a motion to accelerate the deferred sentence and dismiss his case. \nOn March 22, 2019, it was ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the case against him be \ndismissed.  \n \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing the applicability of one or more of the \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32, which provide: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant has not been arrested since January 2015. He has demonstrated \nreform under AG \u00b6 32(d) by successfully completing his probation with no evidence of \nany violation over the four years. His conduct was the result of unusual circumstances. \n \n\n \n8 \nApplicant\u2019s neighbor had a problem with his barking dogs. The dogs barked \ncontinuously for long periods of time. The police had responded four times to complaints \nfrom various neighbors, the owner was ticketed for disturbing the peace, and went to \ncourt responding to a complaint over his barking dogs. He was fined by the city. The \ndogs were rescue dogs and after the newspaper article and television news report \nabout this incident, the dog rescue came and removed the dogs from the home.  \n \nApplicant had previously called the police about the barking, only to be told the \npolice would respond to loud party noise, but not to animal noise. When a different \nneighbor complained about the barking, the dogs\u2019 owner dropped off a fan to that \nneighbor suggesting that \u201cwhite noise\u201d would cover up the barking. When another \nneighbor complained, the dogs\u2019 owner put threatening notes on people\u2019s doors \nthroughout the neighborhood.  \n \nApplicant was kept awake by the barking. When the dogs started barking the \nfollowing night, Applicant went to the dog owner\u2019s home to leave a note complaining \nabout the barking. Applicant was unsure if anyone would be at the home. When the \nowner answered the door, Applicant confronted him about the barking. The dogs\u2019 owner \nlied saying this was the first time he had received a complaint about the barking. The \ndogs\u2019 owner became very upset when Applicant challenged the owner about his lie that \nhe had never received complaints about the dogs\u2019 barking. When Applicant stated he \nknew the owner had already been fined by the court for the barking, this further angered \nthe owner.  \n \nAfter Applicant stated his complaint, he returned to his car to leave. Both \nindividuals were very upset and swearing. Applicant got into his car when the dogs\u2019 \nowner struck the hood of Applicant\u2019s car numerous times denting the hood of \nApplicant\u2019s car. At that time, Applicant saw something in the owner\u2019s hand, but because \nthere was no porch light, Applicant could not tell what it was, only that it was metallic. It \nturned out to be a cell phone, but it is not uncommon that a homeowner in the state to \nleave their home with a handgun. \n \nApplicant showed poor judgment when he got out of his car as his neighbor \ncontinued to approach him. Thinking the neighbor to be armed, Applicant drew his \nhandgun and pointed it at his neighbor yelling for his neighbor to stop. After exchanging \nadditional words, Applicant got back in his car, drove home, called the police, gave the \npolice his address, and said he had drawn his weapon. Since the incident, Applicant \nhas had no interaction with the dogs\u2019 owner. \n \n The district attorney offered to dismiss the charges if Applicant wrote a letter of \napology to the dogs\u2019 owner. When Applicant refused to send the letter of apology, it cost \nhim $4,000 in attorney\u2019s fees plus additional expenses. Applicant decided to accept the \ndistrict attorney\u2019s offer of a misdemeanor when he was told it would cost an additional \n$8,000 to take the matter to court.  \n \n\n \n9 \nOn November 23, 2016, Applicant plead guilty to the misdemeanor of pointing a \nweapon at others, and he was ordered to pay small amounts: a $50 fine, a $50 VCA, \nand $83 in court costs. He successfully completed one year of supervised probation, \nand more than one year of his two year requirement of unsupervised probation. \nAdjudication of the finding of guilty was deferred for three years, which ended in March \n2019 with the Order of Dismissal. Now that the deferred sentence has been \nsuccessfully completed, his record will be expunged. When he made the decision to \nplead to the misdemeanor, he had no idea that doing so would affect his security \nclearance.  \n \n \nApplicant realizes he acted inappropriately and wishes he had never gone to the \ndogs\u2019 owner\u2019s home. The dogs\u2019 owner\u2019s previous actions in no way excuse Applicant\u2019s \nactions, but did give Applicant insight in what to expect from the dogs\u2019 owner. The \nfrustration due to lack of sleep and the police not responding to barking dogs \ncontributed to his inappropriate actions, but he makes no excuses for his actions. \n \nThe mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32(a) apply as so much time has elapsed \nsince the criminal behavior happened and it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur. The incident occurred in January 2015, more \nthan four years ago. The events of the evening are both unusual and unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32(b) apply. Applicant\u2019s lack of sleep from \nthe previous night and all the previous times of barking dogs was a pressure that is no \nlonger present in Applicant\u2019s life, now that the dogs have been removed from his \nneighbor\u2019s home. AG \u00b6 32(d) applies since it has been more than four years without \nrecurrence of criminal activity and Applicant complied with all court orders including his \n130 hours of community service at the dog shelter. His probation has ended and his \ndeferred sentence has been successfully completed. Applicant\u2019s has a good \nemployment record as evidenced by his senior logistics manager\u2019s opinion that \nApplicant is very dedicated, detailed, and passionate about the work he performs and is \none of the company\u2019s better project management specialists.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concerns about personal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 15:  \n  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is a cross-allegation of the criminal conduct allegations in SOR \u00b6 1. \nThe security concerns associated with that conduct are largely addressed under \nGuideline J above. Nevertheless, AG \u00b6 16(d)(2) also applies. Applicant\u2019s arrests might \naffect his personal, professional, or community standing. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) applies. \n\n \n10 \n AG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n  \n(d) \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother single guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) any disruptive, \nviolent, or other inappropriate behavior. \n  \nAG \u00b6 16(e)6 does not apply because following the incident there was a \nnewspaper article and television coverage of the incident. The incident does not cause \nApplicant to be vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress because it is known \nto the public.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E:  \n \n(c) \nthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n  \n(d) \nthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n  \n(e) \nthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n As previously stated, it has been more than four years since the incident and it \nhappened under unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. \nAlthough Applicant has not received counseling, he acknowledged his behavior showed \npoor judgment, and in light of his neighbor\u2019s history of inappropriate and threatening \nconduct, he should never have gone to his neighbor\u2019s home. Now that the dogs have \nbeen removed from his neighbor\u2019s home the stressors and circumstances that \ncontributed to the inappropriate behavior is unlikely to recur. \n                                                          \n6 AG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other \nindividual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n\n \n11 \nAs previously stated, following the incident, a newspaper article and television \nnews report informed the public, which included his employer\u2019s security office, about his \narrest. This reduces or eliminates any ongoing vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation \nor duress stemming from his circumstances. AG \u00b6 17(e) applies. Applicant realizes he \nacted inappropriately and wishes he had never gone to the dogs\u2019 owner\u2019s home. The \nfrustration due to lack of sleep and the police not responding to barking dogs \ncontributed to his inappropriate actions, but he makes no excuses for his actions. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. My comments under Guidelines J and E are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 56 years old, and he has been employed by a DoD contractor as a \nflight engineer and project manager from August 2000 to present. He honorably served \nin the U.S. Air Force from 1981 through 1985. He had no overseas deployments while \non active duty, but spent three and a half years in Saudi Arabia with his contractor job. \n  \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant realizes he acted inappropriately and wishes \nhe had never gone to the dogs\u2019 owner\u2019s home. The frustration due to lack of sleep and \nthe police not responding to barking dogs contributed to his inappropriate actions, but \nhe makes no excuses for his actions. Applicant made a number of mistakes related to \nthe incident, but the three biggest were: first, going to his neighbor\u2019s home to leave a \nnote about the barking dogs; second, pointing his gun at his neighbor; and, third, not \nwriting the letter of apology. Had he written the letter of apology, the DA would have \ndismissed the case. Applicant\u2019s decision not to write the letter cost him $4,000 for his \n\n \n12 \ninitial attorney, $4,000 for his second attorney, additional costs, stress, and a matter that \nstarted in January 2015 and came to a conclusion with the March 2019, Motion to \nDismiss. Applicant was reluctant to apologize for pointing a firearm at his neighbor \nbecause he believed that based on his knowledge of the facts and circumstances \npointing a firearm at his neighbor was warranted as self-defense. He should have \napologized because from his neighbor\u2019s perspective, his neighbor was threatened with \na firearm on his own property when he was unarmed.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s service to the U.S. military, his current position, and that \nthis was a single, although serious, incident. His senior logistics manager, who was \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for two and a half years, believes Applicant is very dedicated, \ndetailed, and passionate about the work he performs on aircraft upgrades. He believes \nApplicant has strong morals that drive his decisions and highly recommends Applicant. \nHis project manager believes Applicant is one of the better project management \nspecialists in the company. Applicant had completed 130 hours of community service at \na dog shelter and the president and founder of the shelter organization believes \nApplicant was very hard working and a dedicated volunteer who always put in the best \npossible effort.  \n \n Supervisors have many tasks, but two of the most important of their many tasks \nare: first, to accomplish the mission, and second, to evaluate those individuals assigned \nto them. A portion of their duties is to make sure the right people receive proper training, \nare assigned the right positions, and determine who should be promoted or remain with \nthe company. Their character evaluations are important and often more accurate \nbecause they have observed applicants over longer periods of time and under a variety \nof events and stresses. These supervisors are required to evaluate individuals and \ndescribe their performance, trustworthiness, reliability, and dedication. I place a great \ndeal of weight on the evaluations given by Applicant\u2019s senior logistics manager, project \nmanager, and the president and founder of the organization running the dog shelter, \nand rightly so. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, DOD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. The issue is whether this serious single incident raises \nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Criminal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 46-year-old warehouse material expeditor, employed by a defense contractor since 1998. He graduated from high school in 1991. He married in 1992 and divorced in 2008. He again married in 2014. He has two adult children and one adult step- son. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1992 to 1997, and was honorably discharged. Applicant was previously granted a top secret security clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information in 2006, but it was revoked for financial concerns and denied by a DOHA Administrative Judge in 2013. The SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on nearly $20,000 in debts, including unpaid Federal income taxes for tax year 2015, and child support obligations. The SOR also alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2007 that was dismissed in November 2007, and that Applicant failed to file Federal and state tax returns when due for tax years 2009-2013. The SOR allegations are sufficiently supported by relevant evidence. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began during his first marriage and 2008 divorce. Applicant and his spouse filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2007 to reorganize about $30,000 in debts. (Tr. 31) The bankruptcy was dismissed because Applicant\u2019s debt to income ratio did not qualify for a Chapter 13 proceeding. (GE 3) He did not pursue a Chapter 7 discharge. By 2013, Applicant again had nearly $30,000 in delinquent debts. (GE 10) He attributed these debts to medical expense",

Applicant was previously granted a top secret security clearance with access \nto sensitive compartmented information in 2006, but it was revoked for financial concerns \nand denied by a DOHA Administrative Judge in 2013. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on nearly $20,000 in debts, including \nunpaid Federal income taxes for tax year 2015, and child support obligations. The SOR \nalso alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2007 that was \ndismissed in November 2007, and that Applicant failed to file Federal and state tax returns \nwhen due for tax years 2009-2013. The SOR allegations are sufficiently supported by \nrelevant evidence. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began during his first marriage and 2008 divorce. \nApplicant and his spouse filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2007 to reorganize about \n$30,000 in debts. (Tr. 31) The bankruptcy was dismissed because Applicant\u2019s debt to \nincome ratio did not qualify for a Chapter 13 proceeding. (GE 3) He did not pursue a \nChapter 7 discharge. By 2013, Applicant again had nearly $30,000 in delinquent debts. \n(GE 10) He attributed these debts to medical expenses, his divorce in 2008, his former \nspouse\u2019s poor spending habits, and a decrease in work hours. After a 2013 DOHA \nhearing, Applicant was denied security eligibility based on his unmitigated delinquent \ndebts. \n \nApplicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2009 \nthrough 2013, when due. He later filed the delinquent returns, and owes the IRS \napproximately $4,000 in unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest from the 2015 tax year. At \nhis hearing in this case, Applicant admitted that his Federal and state income tax returns \nfor 2016 and 2017 were also past due and unfiled. In his post-hearing submission, \nApplicant did not provide evidence that these returns have been filed. He attributed his \nfailure to file tax returns on time to his inability to work with his former spouse regarding \nclaiming the children as dependents, and their efforts to reconcile. He also admitted that \nhe did not have sufficient money to pay taxes owed. He did not seek assistance from a \ntax preparer, and he has not arranged a payment plan with the IRS. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nAfter their divorce, Applicant and his ex-spouse reconciled and lived together from \nlate 2008 to 2011. They purchased a 2009 luxury vehicle together. His spouse kept the \nvehicle after they separated in 2011, and it was repossessed in 2012. Applicant is jointly \nresponsible for the debt. He noted that he contacted a debt collection agency in 2012 or \n2013, but was unable to renegotiate the debt which totals over $8,000. (SOR \u00b6 1.a)  He \nclaimed that subsequent contact with the agency showed they no longer held the debt. \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 credit report shows the debt became delinquent in 2011 and was \ncharged off. No post-hearing documentation was provided to show the current status of \nthe debt or Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve it. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a $6,816 timeshare property debt, placed in collection with an agency \nin about 2015. Applicant admitted the debt, and stated that he has been making automatic \nmonthly payments from his bank account to resolve it. The debt no longer appears on his \n2016 or 2017 credit reports. \n \nApplicant is delinquent on a mortgage for rental property he owns. He stated that \nthe property is occupied, but he has been unable to catch up on his mortgage payments \nthat became delinquent in May 2017, when he used the funds to pay for maintenance of \nthe property. The debt is reported on his 2017 credit report as a past-due Veterans \nBenefits Administration mortgage. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) No post-hearing information was provided \nshowing the current status of the mortgage or efforts to resolve the past-due debt.  \n \nApplicant became delinquent on child-support obligations because of a \ndisagreement with his former spouse. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) His pay was involuntarily garnished in \n2016 or 2017, and released in July 2018 after the arrearage was paid. (AE F) This debt \nis resolved. \n \nApplicant has not sought financial counseling nor does he have a budget. He noted \nthat since his 2013 DOHA case, he controls his purchases and pays his debts. He has \nless than $1,200 in savings. His current supervisor testified to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness \nand work ethic. He noted that Applicant is a family man who would never put himself in a \nnegative light in front of his children, and that his financial problems have not affected his \nwork. Several other co-workers also attested to his trustworthiness, reliability, dedication, \nexpertise and professionalism. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record supporting the \nSOR allegations are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n\n \n6 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies and other debts have been a long-standing, recurring \nproblem. Although he has been working full-time with his current employer since 1998, \nhe has not shown an ability to address delinquent debts, nor has he shown financial \nresponsibility. Applicant\u2019s on-again off-again relationship with his former spouse does not \nexcuse his failure to file income tax returns when due, and his failure to arrange payment \nof a 2015 past-due income-tax debt is inexcusable. The evidence shows that Applicant \nhas not made diligent efforts to resolve his debts, and the only resolved matter, delinquent \nchild support obligations, occurred through an involuntary garnishment order. Although \nhe has now filed his 2009 through 2013 tax returns, he admitted that his 2016 and 2017 \nFederal and state returns were not filed when due, and he has not shown that they have \nbeen filed since his hearing. Additionally, he has not sought financial counseling or \nprofessional assistance with his debts and tax obligations. \n \nOverall, I find that Applicant has continued his long-standing financial \nirresponsibility, and has not adequately addressed his delinquent debts. I find that his \nfinancial status is not under control and that similar problems are likely to recur. No \nmitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).2 Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \n                                                     \n2 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to \ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age \nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence \nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s long \nhistory of financial irresponsibility despite a long-standing work history has not been \nmitigated. His military service and difficulties with personal relationships do not overcome \nhis financial irresponsibility. Given his past efforts to keep and attain a security clearance, \nthe Government\u2019s expectations for financial responsibility should have been clear. \nWhether Applicant\u2019s actions with regard to his finances amount to simple inattention or \nnegligence, he has clearly not heeded that knowledge. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a; 1.d, 1.f \u2013 1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 1, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On March 9, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For \nAccess to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) applicable to all adjudications and \nother determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006.1 \n                                                          \n \n  12/11/2018\n\n  \n  \n2  \n                                        \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 31, 2017. In a notarized statement, dated \nApril 17, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to \nproceed on May 5, 2017. The case was initially assigned to another administrative judge \nin June 2017, but was eventually reassigned to me on March 20, 2018.  A Notice of \nHearing was issued on August 28, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nSeptember 25, 2018. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE G were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 4, 2018. I kept the record open to \nenable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely \nsubmitted several documents, which were marked and admitted as AE H through AE Z, \nwithout objection. The record closed on October 30, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations of the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an information systems service operations manager since around 1994 with a business \nunit of one company that was eventually purchased by another company. A 1981 high \nschool graduate, Applicant earned some college credits, but no degree. He enlisted in the \nU.S. Air Force in August 1981, and he served on active duty until he was honorably \ndischarged in December 1991 as a Staff Sergeant (E-5). He was granted a secret \nclearance in 1981, and has retained that clearance except for periods when he possessed \na top secret clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). \nApplicant was married in July 1985, separated in August 2012, and divorced in December \n2016. He started cohabiting in September 2014, and in October 2017, he was again \nmarried. He has two daughters, born in 1991 and 2001. \n                                                          \n1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December \n10, 2016, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or \ncontinued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, were \nestablished to supersede all previously issued national security adjudicative criteria or guidelines. \nAccordingly, those guidelines previously implemented on September 1, 2006, under which this security \nclearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the two versions, there is no substantial \ndifference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case. \n \n\n  \n  \n3  \n                                        \nMilitary Service, Awards, and Decorations  \n  \nDuring his military service, Applicant was deployed from August 1990 until \nFebruary 1991 in support of Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. He was awarded \nthe Air Force Commendation Medal, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, the Air Force \nAchievement Medal, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Air Force Outstanding Unit \nAward, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal (with two clusters), the National Defense \nService Medal, the Air Force Overseas Short Tour Ribbon, the Air Force Overseas Long \nTour Ribbon, the Air Force Longevity Service Award Ribbon, the Non-Commissioned \nOfficer Professional Military Education Graduate Ribbon, the Small Arms Expert \nMarksmanship Ribbon, and the Air Force Training Ribbon.2  \n \n Financial Considerations3 \n  \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to several different issues that initially \narose in or about mid-2012: he and his wife separated, leading to a lengthy and costly \ndivorce; he was required to maintain two households during the period of separation; he \nwas ordered to pay child support and alimony; his employer was unsuccessful in re-\ncompeting  on a contract, and he was initially issued a layoff notice; he was subsequently \noffered a new position with the same employer which required that he relocate, at his own \nexpense, to a different state;4 and although his primary residence was on the market for \nover six months, it did not sell. Because of the additional unexpected expenses, \ninsufficient funds caused him to fall behind on his mortgage. Although Applicant \nattempted to obtain mortgage relief through the Home Affordable Modification Program \n(HAMP) in August 2015,5 and offered to include a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, nothing \nworked, and the property was eventually foreclosed.  \nThe SOR identified five purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed for \ncollection, charged off, or foreclosed as generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s November 2015 \ncredit report or December 2016 credit report. Those debts total approximately $272,220. \nThe current status of those accounts, is as follows.  \n (SOR \u00b6 1.a.): This is a bank-issued home mortgage loan with a high credit of \n$261,506 and an unpaid balance of $244,414 (of which $11,726 was past due), that was \n                                                          \n2 AE H (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214), dated December 11, \n1991). \n  \n3 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: GE 1 (e-QIP, dated October 1, 2015); GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated \nJanuary 7, 2016); GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated November 10, \n2015); GE 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 20, 2016); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated \nApril 17, 2017.   \n  \n4 AE C (Notification of Layoff and associated documents, various dates). \n \n5 AE B (HAMP Application and Related Papers, various dates). \n \n\n  \n  \n4  \n                                        \neventually sold at foreclosure in June 2016.6 Although there was an in personam \ndeficiency judgment balance of $24,777 against Applicant as of October 20, 2016, the \namount was considered by the court to be a marital debt to be paid by Applicant and his \nex-wife.7 Applicant stopped making his monthly payments in July 2015, in anticipation of \na layoff, has not yet made any payments on this account after the foreclosure because \nhe supposedly had insufficient funds to do so,8 and his ex-wife has avoided paying her \nshare by filing a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.9 \nThe account has not been resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.): This is a bank-issued line of credit with an unpaid and past-due \nbalance of $27,059 that was placed for collection and charged off in 2016.10 As with the \nhome mortgage loan, the amount was considered by the court to be a marital debt to be \npaid by Applicant and his ex-wife.11 Applicant\u2019s ex-wife has avoided paying her share by \nfiling a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Applicant \ninitially contended that he had entered into an agreement with a particular company that \npurchased the account,12 but that payment agreement to which he refers is a credit-card \naccount with the same creditor, in the amount of $11,674, that was not alleged in the \nSOR, which was also considered to be a marital debt to be paid by both Applicant and \nhis ex-wife.13 Although he said he would reach out to the creditor in an effort to set up \nrepayment arrangements,14 to date, he has offered no evidence that he has done so.15 \nThe account has not been resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. through 1.e.): These are three medical accounts with unpaid \nbalances of $430, $195, and $122 that were placed for collection.16 Applicant paid the \nlargest and the smallest accounts, for a total of $553, in April 2017,17 and he paid the \n                                                          \n6 GE 3, supra note 3, at 6; GE 4, supra note 3, at 2; AE A (Report of Mediation, dated March 4, \n2016). \n \n7 AE A, supra note 6. \n \n8 Tr. at 34-36. \n \n9 AE L (Notice of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Case, dated April 25, 2017); Tr. at 37. \n \n10 GE 3, supra note 3, at 6; GE 4, supra note 3, at 2; AE A, supra note 6. \n \n11 AE A, supra note 6. \n \n12 Tr. at 40.

His divorce decree identified the joint bank-issued credit card with \nan unpaid balance of $11,674 which was referred to above for which there is a payment \nplan calling for preauthorized monthly payments of $121.60 commencing in April 2017;20 \nand there is a bank-issued credit card in his ex-wife\u2019s name, also considered a marital \ndebt, with an unpaid balance of $21,438.21 Applicant referred to other credit cards for both \nhis ex-wife and himself for which he was making payments, and that he managed to get \none account paid off. He submitted documentation to support his position that one such \npast-due account for $2,769 was settled in August 2018 when he paid $830,22 but he \nfailed to submit documentation, such as receipts, letters, cancelled checks, or account \nstatements reflecting either continuing monthly payments or payment plans. \nAlthough Applicant has \u201cdefinitely been thinking about\u201d financial counseling, he has \nnever had it.23 During the hearing, Applicant said his current annual salary was over \n$120,000.24 After the hearing, he submitted a Personal Financial Statement reflecting a \nmonthly net income of $7,237; monthly expenses of $5,281; with a monthly remainder of \n$1,290 that might be available for discretionary spending or savings.25 However, based \non the figures furnished by Applicant, his actual annual salary is approximately \n$125,000.26 Among the debts listed in his Personal Financial Statement, Applicant \nindicated that he was making monthly payments on four of his current wife\u2019s accounts, \n                                                          \n18 AE F (Payment Information, dated February 22, 2017). \n \n19 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard.

Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d33 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.34  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d35  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d36 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \n                                                          \n33 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:        \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:   \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n  \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators.  \n  \nA home mortgage was foreclosed in 2016, leaving a deficiency balance of \n$24,777; a line of credit in the amount of $27,069 was charged off in 2016; and three \nmedical accounts were placed for collection. Because Applicant and his ex-wife were \njointly responsible for the mortgage and line of credit, and she filed for bankruptcy under \nChapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to avoid her financial responsibility, Applicant has \nbeen reluctant, if not unwilling, to satisfy those debts regardless of the ability to do so. He \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nclaimed to have insufficient funds to make payments on several accounts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(e) have been established.  \n     \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;37 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;38 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n                                                          \n37 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \n38 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nI have concluded that \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, and none of the other conditions \napply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties \nmake it difficult to conclude that they occurred so long ago or were so infrequent, or that \nthey were unlikely to recur. In fact, they continue to this day. Applicant attributed his \nfinancial problems to several different factors: his lengthy separation and eventual \ndivorce; maintaining two households during the period of separation; he was ordered to \npay child support and alimony; after being notified of a layoff, he was offered a new \nposition with the same employer which required that he relocate, at his own expense, to \na different state; and although his primary residence was on the market for over six \nmonths, it did not sell. The significance of those factors has not been satisfactorily \nsupported by appropriate documentation. Applicant did go through a lengthy separation \nand divorce. Paying child support and alimony to the woman to whom he was married for \nnearly three decades would not be unexpected, in-as-much he would have been \nresponsible for them had the separation and divorce not occurred. While he was notified \nof an expected layoff, he was never actually terminated, and instead, he moved to a \ndifferent position where his salary was increased. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s annual salary has been over $100,000 for several years, and \nis currently at $125,000, he has made little, if any, efforts to address his delinquent \naccounts until after he was motivated to do so upon receipt of the SOR. He stopped \nmaking his monthly mortgage payments in July 2015. He has ignored the deficiency since \nthe house was foreclosed and sold at public auction, and he has also ignored the line of \ncredit. Instead, Applicant made one extremely modest payment of $195 for a delinquent \nmedical account, one year after he was interviewed by the OPM investigator, and only \nmonths before the SOR was issued. He made two other relatively modest payments of \n$430 and $122 after the SOR was issued. An applicant who begins to resolve his financial \nproblems only after being placed on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy \nmay be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over \ntime or when the is no immediate threat to his or her own interests.39 There is evidence \nof a repayment plan on a credit card not alleged in the SOR, but aside from the \nagreement, there is no evidence of any payments. With a substantial monthly remainder, \nApplicant could have started making payments on the mortgage deficiency and the line \nof credit well before the SOR was issued, but instead, he has made no efforts to do so. \nApplicant\u2019s minimal efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts, or at least his portion of \nthose accounts do not qualify as good-faith efforts. His promised intentions to reach out \nto his creditors, at this late date, are simply insufficient.40  \n                                                          \n                                                          \n39 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n \n40 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future was not \na substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially \nresponsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time.   \nWhile there is evidence that Applicant never received financial counseling, \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation is sound on one hand, with a good salary and a substantial \nmonthly remainder, but, on the other hand, he is ignoring his delinquent debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.41  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.42  \n  \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a \n54-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving as an information systems service \noperations manager since around 1994 with a business unit of one company that was \neventually purchased by another company.

He was granted a secret clearance in 1981, and has retained that clearance except \nfor periods when he possessed a top secret clearance with SCI access. Since his financial \ndifficulties commenced, he made minimal payments to resolve three medical debts. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s annual salary has been over $100,000 for several years, and is \ncurrently at $125,000, he has made little, if any, efforts to address his delinquent accounts \nuntil after he was motivated to do so upon receipt of the SOR. He stopped making his \nmonthly mortgage payments in July 2015. He has ignored the $24,777 deficiency since \nthe house was foreclosed and sold at public auction, and he has also ignored the $27,059 \nline of credit. In addition, there are non-SOR delinquent debts for $11,674 and $21,438. \nApplicant made one extremely modest payment of $195 for a delinquent medical account, \none year after he was interviewed by the OPM investigator, and only months before the \nSOR was issued. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:43 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \n \n                                                          \n43 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Guideline E, personal conduct concerns were not established. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n     Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 9, 2014. On \nMarch 27, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The DOD CAF \nacted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 14, 2017. He denied 7 of the 12 SOR \nallegations and admitted the others with explanations. He denied the falsification \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant also requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge in May 2017 and \ntransferred to me on October 16, 2017. On January 18, 2019, the Defense Office of \n03/05/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the video teleconference hearing \n(VTC) hearing was scheduled for February 7, 2019. I convened the VTC hearing as \nscheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request until February 21, 2019, and he \nprovided several post-hearing documents by email of February 13, 2019, that were \ncollectively marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A and admitted without objection. On \nFebruary 21, 2019, Applicant provided more supplemental documents that were \ncollectively marked as AE B and admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on February 21, 2019.  \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 57 years old. He graduated from high school in 1979 and had some \ncollege. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1979 and served honorably for 14 years \nbefore accepting a voluntary separation incentive to retire early as a senior chief petty \nofficer (E-8). He served as an electronics technician, including submarine duty, and \nparticipated in Operation Desert Shield in 1990. Applicant earned numerous awards \nincluding four Navy Achievement Medals (NAMs) for his service. (Tr. 26-27) He has \nbeen married three times: 1979 to 1986; 2003 to 2005; and presently since 2014. He \nreported three adult-children by his first wife. Applicant has been employed as a project \nmanager for a federal contractor since 2008. He has worked for federal contractors, with \na security clearance, for over 25 years without infractions. (Tr. 22) Applicant travels 95% \nof the time for his job. (Tr. 23)  \n  \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling approximately $26,571, including a \npast-due second mortgage on his primary residence in the amount of $14,681 at SOR \u00b6 \n1.i. The SOR also alleges three delinquent medical debts, utility and credit-card debts. \nApplicant did not disclose any of these delinquencies in section 26 (Financial Record) of \nhis SCA. (GE 1)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reflect that he obtained a primary mortgage in the \napproximate amount of $148,000 in March 2006. (GE 2) At the same time, he obtained \na home equity loan or second mortgage in the amount of $37,000. Both loans were \ntransferred several times, and Applicant has continuously paid his primary mortgage as \nagreed. (GE 2\u20136) His 2014 credit report indicates that the second mortgage was past \ndue in the amount of $14,681, and the last activity on the account was in December \n2011 before it was closed and transferred. (GE 2) A real property transaction record \nconcerning his primary residence, reflects that at some point the second mortgage was \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s July 9, 2014 security \nclearance application (SCA) and the summaries of his security clearance interviews on February 17, \n2015, and November 1, 2016. \n \n\n \n3 \n \ntransferred to Countrywide Mortgage Company.2 (GE 7) It fell off Applicant\u2019s later credit \nreports without explanation. (GE 5-6)  \n \nIn his personal subject interview (PSI) with a clearance investigator in February \n2015, Applicant stated he had been making payments of $350 per month on the second \nmortgage when he fell behind on payments. (GE 8) He tried to negotiate, but the \ncreditor wanted payment of the full $14,681 due, and he could not afford to pay that. \nApplicant testified credibly that since then, the second mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.i) was \ntransferred and he has made multiple phone calls to try to discern the present creditor \nholding that loan, to no avail. (Tr. 53-54) He fell behind on payments because he had a \nheart attack in 2011. He was disabled, and out of work, for six months. (Tr. 33, 55) The \ncreditor stopped communicating with Applicant. He testified that he refinanced his \nprimary residence in August 2018 without problems and there was no mention of the \nsecond mortgage by his present lender. (Tr. 57-60) Applicant corroborated this by \nproviding supplemental, post-hearing documents including a closing disclosure \nstatement showing a payoff of $124,195 to the previous mortgagee and no reference to \nany second mortgagee.3 (AE A)  \n \n SOR \u00b6 1.a is for a medical debt placed for collection in the amount of $2,229. \nApplicant testified that this was a result of an ambulance ride required to transport him \nbetween hospitals after his heart attack. (Tr. 37) He felt that the total ambulance bill of \n$4,000 was exorbitant for a short ride. Nonetheless, he is now in a payment plan and \nmaking monthly payments of $150 per month on this debt. (AE A) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d \nare also medical debts placed for collection by the same creditor as a result of co-\npayments that were not covered by Applicant\u2019s medical insurance. These have been \npaid in full. (Tr. 39-40, AE A, GE 5) Applicant testified that the charged-off debt for $242 \nat SOR \u00b6 1.b was for the purchase of a horse trailer. (Tr. 38) It was paid in full in May \n2017. (AE A)  \n \nApplicant testified that the debt placed for collection in the amount of $1,077 at \nSOR \u00b6 1.e was disputed with the three major credit-reporting-bureaus as it is not his \ncredit-card debt. (Tr. 40-41) He researched the matter and made phone calls to the \noriginal creditor (bank). Applicant provided post-hearing documentation that the creditor \nwas unable to substantiate these debts and no longer considers them valid collection \naccounts. (Tr. 42, AE B) Applicant was overseas for extended periods of time for his \njob, and he admits that he did not check his credit reports for about 10 years. (GE 8) He \n                                                          \n2 This disgraced mortgage-lender was \u201cat the epicenter of the mortgage meltdown that in 2008 brought \nthe nation\u2019s economy to its knees.\u201d (N.Y. Times, June 24, 2016 article) John Leibowitz, Chairman of the \nFederal Trade Commission was quoted \u201cIts business model was based on deceit and corruption, and the \nharm caused to the American consumer is absolutely massive and extraordinary.\u201d  Countrywide was a \nsubsidiary of Bank of America (BOA). The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) reached a $16.65 Billion civil \nsettlement with BOA in 2014 for systematic mortgage fraud \u2013 the largest civil settlement against a single \nentity in American history. See DOJ Office of Public Affairs press release dated August 21, 2014 \u2013 Bank \nof America to pay $16.65 Billion in Historic Settlement for Financial Fraud Leading up to an during the \nFinancial Crisis. \n \n3 I infer that a proper title search was completed before this closing in compliance with prevailing real-\nestate law and practices.  \n\n \n4 \n \ntold the clearance investigator he was not aware of the credit-card debts and he ignored \nsome debts. He has an active account with the creditor at SOR \u00b6 1.e. He testified that \nthe same status applies to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,466) and \u00b6 1.l ($4,419), which \nare for a credit-card debt placed for collection in the amount of $4,419 and an account \nplaced for collection for $1,466. These were effectively disputed and the creditor no \nlonger considers them to be valid debts. (AE B)  \n \nThe credit-card debt placed for collection by a bank at SOR \u00b6 1.h was also \neffectively disputed to the three credit bureaus, and the creditor no longer considers it a \nvalid debt. (AE B) This was a credit card for a home-improvement store. (GE 8) The \ndebt placed for collection by a telecommunication company in the amount of $197 at \nSOR \u00b6 1.f has been paid in full. (GE 5-6) The retail store debt placed for collection in the \namount of $1,157 at SOR \u00b6 1.j was compromised and settled for $354. (AE A) The \ndelinquent phone bill at SOR \u00b6 1.k for $296 was paid in full in July 2014. (AE A, Tr. 46) \nThe debt placed for collection by a bank in the amount of $1,466 at SOR \u00b6 1.l was for a  \ncomputer that Applicant never received. (GE 8) He disputes this debt.  \n \nApplicant testified that he had a salary of $135,000 to 140,000 in 2018. (Tr. 60) \nHe receives $600 a month in military retirement, and he has approximately $15,000 in \nsavings. He told the clearance investigator that he and his wife have residual or \ndiscretionary income of approximately $ 3,000 each month. (GE 8) Applicant completed \nhis SCA in Korea in July 2014. He did not list his delinquent debts because he was not \naware of them, and he admits making financial mistakes and not checking his credit \nreports. (Tr. 70) He testified credibly that he was honestly unaware of these \ndelinquencies and he did not deliberately intend to deceive the government or falsify the \nSCA.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are confirmed by his credit \nreports and answer to the SOR. The Government produced substantial evidence to \nsupport the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.4 Applicant has met that burden. The second mortgage and other delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR have been adequately addressed.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;     \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant endured a heart attack, a divorce, and extensive overseas travel for \nwork. Arguably, these conditions were beyond his control. Once he realized that the \ndelinquencies might affect his eligibility for a security clearance, he effectively disputed \nsome debts, and paid others. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and he \nproduced relevant or responsive documentation either in response to the SOR or in \npost-hearing documents. Applicant has the burden to provide sufficient evidence to \nshow that his financial problems are under control, and that his debts were incurred \nunder circumstances making them unlikely to recur. He met that burden. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a),(b),(d) and (e) apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n                                                          \n4 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n7 \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n        Applicant testified credibly that he was in Korea when he completed his SCA in \n2014 and he honestly was not aware of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Since \nthe evidence shows that his largest debt, the second mortgage, does not exist, and \nmany other debts were successfully disputed or paid off, I find his testimony to be \ncompelling and I accept his explanation. It has not been established that he deliberately \nor intentionally falsified his SCA or tried to deceive the government. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \n\n \n8 \n \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guidelines.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Foreign \ninfluence and personal conduct concerns were not mitigated, but financial considerations \nwere mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCAs) on June 16, 2009, and \nOctober 6, 2015. On June 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), \nand Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 17, 2017, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2018. The SOR \nwas amended on March 29, 2018, to change two dates and references from Frankfurt, \nGermany to Mannheim, Germany in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 2.l. The amended SOR was properly \nserved on Applicant, who admitted the revised allegations on January 27, 2019. \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued hearing notices with \nother administrative judges on April 20, 2018, and June 15, 2018, that were canceled in \ncoordination with Applicant\u2019s counsel. A hearing notice was issued by me on December \n12, 2018, and the hearing was convened on January 23, 2019. Government Exhibits (GE) \n1 through 10 (and a list of Government exhibits marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1) were \nmarked and GE 1-10 were admitted in evidence. Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B were \nmarked and admitted in evidence. Applicant and his current spouse testified. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 31, 2019. \n \nAlthough Applicant declined to adopt the summary of his interview with a \ngovernment investigator, he made substantial corrections and clarifications to the \nsummary in his response to interrogatories. Most of his corrections involved explanations \nor updates on his interview with the investigator, but some involved correcting or changing \nthe investigator\u2019s summary. The response to interrogatories and the summary statement \nwere admitted in the record without objection (Tr. 16-19). I have noted Applicant\u2019s \ncomments and corrections to the summary interview, and will give appropriate weight to \nthe interview summary based on Applicant\u2019s written corrections, explanations, and \ntestimony. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nDepartment Counsel provided supporting documents that verify, detail, and provide \ncontext for the requested facts. The Government\u2019s request and the supporting \nbackground documents are marked as HE 2. Administrative or official notice is the \nappropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. (ISCR Case No. 05-11292 \nat 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 \nF.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)) Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or derived from government reports. (Stein, \nAdministrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006)) A summary of the general \nfacts noticed are included below. \n \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China is the most aggressive collector of U.S. economic, \nintelligence, and defense information and technology. China\u2019s intelligence services, \nprivate companies, and other entities frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or \npersons with family ties to China who can use their insider access to corporate or \ngovernmental networks, to illegally obtain sensitive or classified information.  \n \nThe United States faces a large and growing threat to its national security from \nChinese intelligence collection operations. These operations have risen significantly over \n\n \n3 \n \nthe past 15 years. Among the most serious threats are China\u2019s efforts at cyber and human \ninfiltration of U.S. national security organizations. China uses a variety of methods to \nacquire foreign military and dual-use technologies, including cyber activity and \nexploitation of access of Chinese nationals - such as students or researchers \u2013 acting as \nprocurement agents or intermediaries. The threat from Chinese intelligence operations \nalso extends overseas, including a growing technical collection capability to monitor \ndeployed U.S. military forces, and attempts to infiltrate defense entities in the U.S. and \npartner countries.  \n \nThe Chinese government has conducted large-scale, professional, cyber \nespionage against the United States and compromised a range of U.S. networks. \nAdditionally, China\u2019s communist government is an authoritarian state that represses and \ncoerces organizations and individuals involved in civil and political rights advocacy, ethnic \nminorities, and law firms representing individuals involved in sensitive cases. China also \nhas a well-known history of significant civil rights abuses against ethnic and religious \nminorities. The government is responsible for arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life, \nforced disappearances, torture and coerced confessions of prisoners, arbitrary and illegal \ndetention at unofficial holding facilities. \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has warned that U.S. citizens visiting or resident in \nChina have been interrogated or detained for reasons said to be related to \u201cstate security,\u201d \nand U.S. citizens may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information \nabout their alleged crime. Also, U.S. citizens may be subject to \u201cexit bans\u201d used coercively \nby Chinese authorities to keep U.S. citizens in China for years. The government regularly \nviolates the individual and human rights of its citizens, and surveils and monitors foreign \nvisitors to China. Hotel rooms, meeting rooms, offices, cars, taxis, telephones, internet \nusage and fax machines may be monitored onsite or remotely, and personal possessions \nin hotel rooms, including computers, may be searched without knowledge or consent of \nthe owner.  \n \nChina does not recognize dual nationality. U.S.-Chinese citizens and U.S. citizens \nof Chinese heritage may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment, and China \nmay prevent the U.S. Embassy from providing consular services. Regardless of the travel \ndocuments used, dual nationals or those with an ethnic or historical tie to China may be \nconsidered by Chinese authorities to be Chinese citizens and can be denied access to \nU.S. consular representatives if detained. Chinese authorities generally consider a child \nborn in China to at least one Chinese parent, to be a Chinese citizen, even if the child \nwas issued a U.S. passport at the time of birth.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old mechanic with a pending employment offer with a \ndefense contractor. He has been employed as a mechanic for another company since \n2015, and has a history of civilian jobs overseas for U.S. defense contractors in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, Kuwait, Syria, and Germany. Applicant was born in South Korea and \nadopted by U.S. citizens in 1980 when he was a child. He naturalized as a U.S. citizen in \n\n \n4 \n \n1984. He did not graduate from high school, but received a general education diploma \n(GED) in 1997. He married a U.S. military member in 2000 and worked as a contractor in \nGermany during his spouse\u2019s assignment there. They divorced in 2009, and he has two \nchildren from that marriage.  \n \nApplicant remarried in October 2010, to a Chinese citizen while he was living in \nChina. They returned to the United States in February 2014, when his spouse became a \npermanent resident of the United States. His spouse naturalized as a U.S. citizen in March \n2018. They have three children, all U.S. citizens. Applicant has never served in the \nmilitary, but he reported that as a civilian contractor, he held a DOD security clearance in \nor about June 2009, and an interim clearance in 2015 that has been withdrawn. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of China, \nand his mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of China. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-b)  \n \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant failed to disclose on a 2015 SCA, \nthree jobs held from 2014 to 2015, and being fired from a job in August 2015. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.a-d) Additionally, the SOR alleges Applicant failed to disclose on the 2015 SCA that he \nwas charged with possession and distribution of marijuana at a U.S. military base in 2002 \n(SOR \u00b6 2.e); charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in 2004 and 2007 while living \nin Germany (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f-g); failing to report being delinquent in child-support obligations \n(SOR \u00b6 2.h), cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c; and failing to report delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6 \n2.i), cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-c, including child-support obligations. \n \nThe SOR also alleges under Guideline E that Applicant failed to disclose on his \n2009 SCA the 2002 charge of distribution and possession of marijuana at a U.S. military \ninstallation, and the 2004 and 2007 alcohol-related charges while in Germany (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.j-l); and failing to disclose intervention by law enforcement because of his use of alcohol, \nand a referral to alcohol counseling or treatment from the 2004 DWI incident (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.m). \n \nFinally, the SOR alleges under Guideline F a delinquent medical collection account \nfor $1,400; a charged-off credit account for $4,884; and a delinquent child-support \naccount for approximately $19,278 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-c).  \n \nGenerally, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, but provided explanations and \nclarifications with his Answers. He generally responded that his failure to report incidents \nin his SCAs resulted from his lack of formal education and he is not computer savvy. He \nclaimed that he did not pay attention to the questions and received inadequate assistance \nwhen completing the SCAs. Additionally, Applicant admitted the allegations listed as \namended SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 2.l. in his answer to the amended SOR. \n \nApplicant was arrested three times, two involving alcohol and one involving drugs. \nIn his 2009 and 2015 SCAs, he reported that he has never been charged with an offense \ninvolving alcohol or drugs. Applicant discussed these incidents in his interview with a \ngovernment investigator. He provided corrections, updates, or explanations to areas of \n\n \n5 \n \nthe interview summary that he believed needed clarification. These incidents are \ndiscussed in further detail below. \n \nIn 2002, Applicant was arrested at a U.S. military installation for possession and \ndistribution of marijuana. In testimony, he claimed he used marijuana once per day for \ntwo weeks to reduce pain from a 2001 hernia surgery. He smoked it in the on-post \nquarters or on his back porch where he and his spouse lived, and he stored it in his kitchen \nout of view of his spouse. He claimed that she never cooked, so she did not discover it in \nthe kitchen. The military police were dispatched to Applicant\u2019s home because of a noise \ncomplaint. Applicant claimed alternatively that he was using it on his back porch and on \nhis couch. During the interaction with military police, Applicant admitted possession of \nmarijuana. He was apprehended and questioned, and he provided a sworn statement. \nLaw enforcement records show that Applicant was found in possession of 130.6 grams \nof marijuana. The police investigation concluded there was probable cause to believe that \nApplicant distributed marijuana by giving a bag containing approximately 4.3 grams to \nanother person, based on admissions by the other person. Applicant provided a sworn \nstatement admitting to possessing and distributing marijuana. The report notes the case \nwas referred to the area Special Assistant U.S. Attorney (SAUSA), who believed that \nthere was sufficient evidence to prosecute Applicant. The record is devoid of additional \ninformation with regard to resulting actions by the SAUSA or installation authorities.   \n \nIn an interview with a government investigator, Applicant acknowledged that he \nwas charged with illegal drug usage. He noted in his interview that military police were \ncalled to his home because of a noise complaint by neighbors, and that they wrote an \nincident report and departed the home. In testimony, he stated that the police were called \nbecause Applicant\u2019s neighbor reported marijuana use. He also first claimed that he was \n\u201cnot arrested, just questioned at another location.\u201d He later admitted that he was arrested \nand transported to the military police station where he provided a statement. (Tr. at 45, \n87) \n \nApplicant stated the charge was dropped because he did not have to appear \nbefore any authority. When asked in his 2009 and 2015 SCAs whether he was \u201cEVER \ncharged with an offense involving drugs,\u201d he replied \u201cno.\u201d He followed this answer with a \nseries of inconsistent and contradictory statements. In his clearance interview, he claimed \nhe did not report it on his 2009 and 2015 SCAs because he forgot about it after the charge \nwas dropped, that it occurred more than 10 years ago, and he simply did not care (GE \n10). He stated in response to interrogatories, that the SCA required him to report only \ndrug usage in the past seven years, and that he did care.  \n \nApplicant was arrested in Germany for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in 2004 after \nhe was stopped by German police and failed a breathalyzer test. He was turned over to \nthe U.S. military police, and released to his spouse and her military command. In 2007, \nApplicant was again arrested in Germany for driving with a blood alcohol content of .067 \nafter drinking at a club and driving. His car was impounded, and he was released to his \nspouse and her military command. He stated to the investigator that he was required to \nattend the Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) as a result of one of his arrests, and \n\n \n6 \n \nhe said he attended more than one session. However, in contradictory testimony, \nApplicant denied ever attending ASAP or any substance abuse evaluation or counseling.  \n \nIn response to questions on his 2009 and 2015 SCAs whether he has \u201cEVER been \ncharged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs,\u201d he responded \u201cno.\u201d He followed this \nwith inconsistent and contradictory statements. In his interview with a government \ninvestigator, he initially denied that he had any prior alcohol-related arrests. When \nreminded by the investigator of the need for candor, he admitted the two incidents in \nGermany. In response to questions on why he had not listed them on his SCAs, he stated \nhe did not read the SCA instructions well, but he was adamant that he only needed to \nreport alcohol-related incidents that occurred within seven years. In his response to \ninterrogatories, he acknowledged that he should have read the SCA instructions better, \nbut thought the question pertained to a seven-year period. He also said the incident \noccurred a long time ago and when he was younger and did not think things through. \nHowever, in testimony, he claimed that he did not report the first alcohol-related arrest \nbecause he did not think it was an arrest since he did not go to jail, and he failed to report \nthe second arrest because he forgot.  \n \nApplicant worked for a government contractor in Iraq for about eight months in \n2008 before resigning, and in Afghanistan from approximately January 2009 until August \n2009. He stated that he met a Chinese national online in August 2009. He vacationed in \nChina for two weeks in August, and met with her. He returned to China in September \n2010, and stayed until February 2014. While in China, Applicant married in October 2010, \ntraveled extensively around China, and their first child was born in China. Applicant also \nheld two jobs in China teaching English to Chinese students from wealthy families, from \n2010 to 2014. He returned to the United States in 2014 with his Chinese-speaking spouse, \nand his first-born child. His spouse did not speak English, except for what he taught her. \n \nApplicant completed an SCA on October 6, 2015. In it, he reported that his mother-\nin-law is a Chinese citizen, living in China, and he and his spouse had daily contact with \nher via the Internet. He reported that his mother-in-law was retired, and her husband was \ndeceased. In testimony, Applicant noted that his mother-in-law never worked in China, \nand now lives with him as a U.S. permanent resident. She owns an apartment in China \nthat she is trying to sell. In Applicant\u2019s interview with a government investigator in \nNovember 2015, he stated that he believed his mother-in-law previously worked as a bus \ndriver. Applicant noted that he does not speak Chinese and his mother-in-law does not \nspeak English, so he has had no verbal or written contact with her even when he lived in \nChina (GE 10).  \n \nIn his 2015 SCA, Applicant reported that he and his spouse had no foreign contacts \nin the previous seven years. However, he testified that his spouse has grandparents, \naunts, uncles, and cousins in China to whom his spouse communicates with about every \ntwo weeks through a phone application. Applicant\u2019s spouse sends items to China that a \ncousin purchases about twice per year. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified, and stated that she returned to China in July 2014 \nand stayed for three months while her mother helped her with her pregnancy. Her mother \ncame to the United States in 2015 and stayed for six months. Her mother then took their \nsecond child back to China for one year when the girl was a year old. At another time, \nshe took another child, at two years old, to China and stayed for 11 months. Her mother \nreturned to the United States in 2016 and applied for permanent resident status in 2018. \nShe stated that her mother retired from selling bus tickets in China, and her father was a \npolice officer who died of cancer at 53 years old. Applicant\u2019s spouse went to university in \nCyprus from 2004 to 2006 for a degree in tourism before returning home to China. After \nmarrying and coming to the United States with Applicant, she naturalized as a U.S. citizen \nin March 2018. She stated that her Chinese passport was cancelled. She attributed her \nexcellent command of the English language to her spouse, who was her primary source \nof instruction. \n \nApplicant failed to report three jobs on his 2015 SCA, including a position teaching \nEnglish to Chinese high-school students in the United States, a position at a car \ndealership, and a position as a crane inspector. In addition, he failed to report that he was \nfired from the crane operator job. These jobs are described below. \n \nFrom August 2014 to June 2015, after returning to the United States from China, \nApplicant taught English to Chinese high-school students residing in the United States. \nHe tutored, supervised, and transported the Chinese students to and from school, and \nlived with them in a home provided by a company that provides these services to Chinese \nnationals in the U.S. He described the job as mostly \u201cbabysitting\u201d and that he did not like \nit. Applicant did not list this employment on his 2015 SCA. In a summary of Applicant\u2019s \ninterview, he stated that he intentionally did not list the job because it had nothing to do \nwith military contracts and he \u201cjust did not want to list it\u201d (GE 10). In his response to \ninterrogatories, he stated that he did not list the job because it was not relevant since it \nhad nothing to do with military contracts and that he was paid as an independent \ncontractor. Applicant\u2019s former employer reported that Applicant left the job voluntarily but \nthe employment was not entirely favorable. His supervisor noted that Applicant was \u201cnot \nwell educated\u201d to be an English teacher, but he worked hard and was responsible (GE \n5). \n \nTwo other jobs were also not disclosed on his SCA, including a three-month \nposition at a car dealership, and a three-month position as a crane inspector. He was \nfired from this job due to a safety violation (GE 6). In a summary of Applicant\u2019s government \ninterview, he stated that he did not disclose the crane inspector job and subsequent firing \nbecause he \u201choped [he] would get away with it\u201d and not get caught. In his response to \ninterrogatories, he claimed that he was upset and embarrassed about the situation \nbecause it was really an episode of racial discrimination against him, rather than a safety \nviolation, and that listing temporary positions, less than six months, were not relevant \nbecause they had nothing to do with military contracts (GE 10). In testimony, he claimed \nhe did not report the missing jobs because he was not at them long enough to list them, \nand he did not list being fired from the crane inspector job because of false statements \nabout him. He described the jobs as \u201cstepping-stone\u201d jobs that he believed did not have \n\n \n8 \n \nto be listed on his SCA when held for less than six months. Of note, in contrast to his \ntestimony and interrogatory response, he did list a five-month teacher job in China and a \nfive-month mechanics job on his 2015 SCA (GE 1). \n \nApplicant was delinquent on three debts, including child-support obligations that \nhe did not report on his 2015 SCA. A medical debt for $1,400 was incurred in 2014 and \nhe testified was paid in 2015 (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Rather, documentation submitted with his \nAnswer to the SOR show that it was paid in 2017.  \n \nA credit card debt was charged off for $4,884 (SOR \u00b6 3.b) after Applicant \u201cforgot \nto pay.\u201d He first claimed it was paid off in 2015, but later testified that it was not paid until \n2016. Rather, documentation submitted with his Answer to the SOR show that it was paid \nin 2017. \n \nA debt on a child-support account for $19,278 was past due (SOR \u00b6 3.c). Applicant \nstopped paying his child support in 2011 while living in China, and stated to a government \ninvestigator that he did not pay the court-ordered support because he was angry at his \nformer spouse. He first testified that he caught up on the arrearage in 2015, but later \nadmitted that his pay was garnished in 2014 or 2015, but his employers did not act on the \ngarnishment order until 2017. As of September 2015, Applicant owed $19,112, and as of \nSeptember 2016, he owed $3,402. Per his Answer to the SOR, his arrearage was paid \noff by 2017. Applicant did not report his garnishment and the child-support debt on his \n2015 SCA (SOR \u00b6 2.h). In addition, he also failed to report the other listed delinquent \ndebts (SOR \u00b6 2.i). He testified that he failed to report the arrearage because he did not \nthink about it. \n \n \nApplicant submitted several letters of support, family photos, and certificates of \ntraining and performance. His co-workers, supervisors, and friends acknowledge his \nperformance, loyalty, and excellent work ethic. I found Applicant to be less than \nforthcoming in testimony, and he often gave conflicting accounts.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n9 \n \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n10 \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, and I considered all of them. The following disqualifying \ncondition are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nThe findings of fact enumerate numerous incidents of falsification and failure to \ndisclose required information, which raise serious questions of Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nhonesty, and reliability. His failure to truthfully, fully, and consistently report his \nbackground and activities to the Government as required, raise unresolved questions \nabout his conduct. \n \nApplicant also failed to disclose two other positions on his SCA, including one \ninvolving an involuntary termination; two alcohol-related criminal incidents in a foreign \ncountry and a referral to alcohol counseling; a drug-related incident involving possession \nand distribution of marijuana on a U.S. military installation; and financial delinquencies \nincluding a substantial child-support arrearage and garnishment order. \n \nThese omissions display a history of poor decisions, qualities of untrustworthiness, \nand a lack of candor that implicates disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16 (a). \n \nGuideline E includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \npersonal conduct. I considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and found \nnone to be fully applicable. \n \n  \nApplicant omitted substantial information from his 2009 and 2015 SCAs. His \nstatements to a government investigator left several areas which required Applicant to \ncorrect or explain in order to mitigate the concerns they raised. I find Applicant\u2019s claims \nof mistake, forgetfulness, or unintentional omissions to be untruthful in themselves. \nApplicant intentionally omitted personally damaging information from his SCAs, and left it \nto the government to discover his past behavior without benefit of his voluntary \ndisclosures. His reaction to the Government investigator\u2019s inquiries resulted in attempts \nto minimize the omissions or conduct. His hearing testimony compounded inconsistencies \nfrom earlier testimony, past responses to interrogatories, the interview summary, and \nSCA answers. \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nAdditionally, based on his demonstrated lack of candor, I am not convinced that \nApplicant\u2019s background has been fully disclosed or adequately explained, to include the \ndepth and circumstances of his association with China and its citizens. These remaining \nquestions, individually and taken together with Applicant\u2019s failure to voluntarily disclose \nrelevant and significant information to the Government, are additional reasons to cause \nme to question his overall truthfulness and trustworthiness with national security \ninformation. \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to \nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7, and I considered all of them. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is now a U.S. citizen. However, they both retain a close \nrelationship with his mother-in-law, a Chinese citizen living with them. China is an \naggressive collector of intelligence and defense information and a country known to \nexploit U.S. citizens of Chinese dissent, Chinese citizens living abroad, and U.S. citizens \nwith connections to China. Applicant\u2019s associations with China, including through his \nspouse and mother-in-law, create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n\n \n12 \n \nThe conditions and concerns raised above and detailed in the findings of fact, \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion, and a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (e) apply. \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8, and I have considered all of them. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nNo mitigation condition fully applies. Applicant\u2019s past and current close contact with \nChina and Chinese citizens is substantial and continuing. His foreign relationships, \nincluding those through his spouse and mother-in-law, are significant. Additionally, he has \nturned at least two of his children over to his mother-in-law to return to China to live \nwithout him or his spouse, for extended periods of time. Applicant lives and works \nprimarily in overseas conflict areas. He also lived and worked in China for four-and-a-half \nyears. Applicant\u2019s family now lives in the United States, along with his mother-in-law who \nremains a Chinese citizen but who lives with him. Applicant\u2019s ties to China continue to \ncreate an unacceptable risk to national security. \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n\n \n13 \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant incurred over $25,000 in delinquent debts, including child-support \narrearages because he did not pay while in China and, alternatively because of a conflict \nwith his ex-spouse. The record evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20, and I considered all of them. The following are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant failed to disclose his delinquent debts on his 2015 SCA, and \nirresponsibly allowed the debts to accrue, especially his past-due child-support \nobligations. He resolved the medical and credit card debts later than he first reported, and \nwas able to make headway toward his child-support arrearage through an involuntary \ngarnishment of his pay. The debts have been resolved or are being satisfactorily resolved, \ntherefore AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n14 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, B, and F in this whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s work for U.S. contractors overseas in conflict areas, and \nhis letters of support, along with his awards, training, and certificates. I acknowledge that \nmarrying a foreign national is not, in and of itself, a disqualifying event. I also recognize \nhis spouse\u2019s efforts to become a U.S. citizen, and her desire to give her children a good \neducation and quality life in the United States.  \n \nI am concerned with Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s previously undisclosed \ncommunications and associations with Chinese relatives living in China. In addition, his \nmother-in-law, who is a Chinese citizen and owns property in China, often travels between \nthe United States and China, including taking Applicant\u2019s children unaccompanied by their \nparents, back to China for extended periods of time. China does not recognize dual \nnationality and dual nationals or those with an ethnic or historical tie to China may be \nconsidered by Chinese authorities to be Chinese citizens. As Applicant\u2019s first child was \nborn in China, it should be noted that China generally considers a child born in China to \nat least one Chinese parent to be a Chinese citizen, even if the child is also a U.S. citizen. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a recent U.S. citizen, has returned to China after residing in the \nUnited States, and she and her children maintain a continuing association with family in \nChina. \n \nApplicant\u2019s four-and-a-half years in China, ties to Chinese citizens, and work \nhistory in China and for Chinese high school students in the United States, is concerning.  \nTaken together with his failure to disclose relevant information in his SCAs, conduct while \nliving overseas and on a U.S. military post, irresponsible financial decisions, and \ninconsistent statements continue to raise questions about his overall honesty, reliability, \nand judgment.  \n\n \n15 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance based on foreign influence \nand personal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nPARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.m:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nPARAGRAPH 3, GUIDELINE F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Olmos, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the Common Access Card (CAC) credentialing concerns raised \nunder supplemental adjudicative standards (SAS) for criminal or dishonest conduct and \nalcohol abuse. The concern for misconduct or negligence in employment was unfounded. \nCAC eligibility is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 31, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing credentialing concerns for CAC eligibility under Homeland \nSecurity Presidential Directive \u2013 12 (HSPD-12). The DOD was unable to find that granting \nApplicant CAC eligibility did not pose an unacceptable risk.1 The concerns raised under the \nAdjudicative Standards of DODI 5200.46 are SAS \u00b6 2.a, criminal or dishonest conduct; \u00b6 \n4.a, alcohol abuse; and \u00b6 1.a, misconduct or negligence in employment. \n \n                                                          \n1 The action was taken under the Adjudicative Standards found in DOD Instruction (DODI) 5200.46, DOD \nInvestigative and Adjudicative Guidelines for Issuing the CAC, dated September 9, 2014, and the \nprocedures set out in Enclosure 3 of DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). \n \n  12/11/2018\n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 23, 2017, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 20, 2017. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 22, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for March 14, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and after the hearing, submitted documents marked as Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A-D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non March 22, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old military-vehicle mechanic for a government contractor \nsince 2014. In 2013, Applicant was terminated from a previous job as a result of a 2013 \ndriving while intoxicated (DWI) conviction. He graduated from high school in 2001. He was \nmarried in 2010 and divorced in 2013. He has three children, two of whom currently live with \nhim. He lives with his girlfriend and cares for her three children as well. He currently holds \nCAC eligibility for access to a government facility. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a 2001 arrest and conviction for DWI; a 2002 arrest for possession \nof a controlled substance that was not prosecuted; a 2010 arrest and conviction for drunk \nin public; a 2011 arrest for assault by physical contact; a 2013 DWI arrest and conviction; \nand a 2013 citation for driving on an invalid license. The alcohol-related allegations were \ncross-alleged under the standard for alcohol abuse, and Applicant\u2019s job loss due to his 2013 \nDWI was alleged under the standard for misconduct or negligence in employment. Applicant \nadmitted all of the allegations except he noted that his 2002 possession charge was \u201cno \nbilled\u201d by the grand jury. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2001 for DWI when he was 18 years old. He attended \nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings and a Mothers Against Drunk Driving course mandated by \nhis terms of probation. In 2002, he was arrested for possession of cocaine, but the case \nwas \u201cno billed\u201d and he was not prosecuted. He admitted first using marijuana while in \nseventh grade, and he stopped in 2010. He also used cocaine once when he was 15 years \nold. \n \n \nIn 2010, Applicant was arrested at a resort for public intoxication after getting into a \ndispute with another person. In 2011, Applicant was arrested for assault after a dispute with \nhis mother\u2019s boyfriend. \n \n \nIn 2013, Applicant was arrested on New Year\u2019s Day for his second DWI. Applicant \nwas convicted and served 15 days in jail. As a result of his conviction, he was terminated \nfrom a job he held since graduating from high school because he was required to install an \nalcohol-interlock device on his work vehicle. His wife divorced him and he lost the home he \nwas renting because of his unemployment. While moving from his home, he was cited for \ndriving on a suspended driver\u2019s license. While serving his sentence in jail, Applicant came \nto the realization that his drinking had led to serious consequences during his life. He vowed \nto stop drinking and has remained abstinent since 2013. \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant was evaluated for substance abuse counseling on March 23, 2018, using \nthe Substance Abuse Screening Inventory (SASSI-4). Based on his history of alcohol use, \nhe was assessed as having a high probability of a substance-use disorder. However, the \nlicensed evaluator noted that the SASSI does not yield a clinical diagnosis, but rather a \nscreening result that can be used as one piece of information when conducting clinical \ndiagnostic evaluations. Based on the DSM-V Diagnostic Criteria for Substance Use \nDisorders, Applicant does not display any symptoms of having a substance-use disorder. \nThe evaluator recommended that Applicant need not seek counseling unless he is unable \nto maintain abstinence. To date, he remains abstinent. \n \n \nApplicant no longer stays at events where alcohol is present. He expressed shame \nfor his past behavior and acknowledged how it adversely affected him and his family. He \nsubmitted character letters that generally support his abstinence from alcohol, renewed \nlifestyle, honesty, work ethic, responsible behavior at work and home, and sincere remorse \nfor his past behavior. Applicant\u2019s work site manager has known him for several years and \nnoted that he is a reliable employee who does not pose a threat to anyone. \n \nPolicies \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The specific \nissues raised are listed in DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 1, Basic Adjudicative \nStandards, and Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards. The overriding factor for \nall of these conditions is unacceptable risk.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility.  \n \nFactors to be applied consistently to all information available include: (1) the nature \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the \nrecency and frequency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of \nthe conduct; (5) contributing external conditions; and (6) the absence or presence of efforts \ntowards rehabilitation. (DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, \u00b6 1)  \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal or Dishonest Conduct \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, SAS \u00b6 2 provides: \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to believe, \nbased on the individual\u2019s criminal or dishonest conduct, that issuance of a \nCAC poses an unacceptable risk. \n \n\n4 \n \na. An individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about his or her reliability or trustworthiness and may put people, \nproperty, or information systems at risk. An individual\u2019s past criminal or \ndishonest conduct may put people, property, or information systems at risk. \n \nSAS \u00b6 2.b lists several conditions that could raise a CAC concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(2) charges or admission of criminal conduct relating to the safety of people \nand proper protection of property or information systems, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n \n(5) actions involving violence or sexual behavior of a criminal nature that \nposes an unacceptable risk if access is granted to federally-controlled facilities \nand federally-controlled information systems. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct including assault and DWI. SAS \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \n(2) and (5) apply. \n \n \nSAS \u00b6 2.c provides circumstances relevant to the determination of whether there is \na reasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk. Relevant conditions include: \n \n(1) the behavior happened so long ago, was minor in nature, or happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur; \n \n(2) charges were dismissed or evidence was provided that the person did not \ncommit the offense and details and reasons support his or her innocence; and \n \n(4) evidence has been supplied of successful rehabilitation, including but not \nlimited to remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, constructive community involvement, or passage of time \nwithout recurrence. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last criminal offense was in 2013. At that time, he contemplated how \ncontinued abuse of alcohol adversely affected him and his future. He acknowledged his past \nbehavior and took action to avoid future problems. He stopped drinking in 2013. His \ntestimony and those of his character references support his sobriety and changed behavior. \nHe has a good work history, and but for his 2013 DWI, he would likely still be employed with \nthe same employer since graduating from high school. However, as a result of his DWI and \nthe need for an alcohol-interlock device on a company vehicle, he lost his long-held job. In \n2014, he found a new position that he has since held without incident. \n \n \nApplicant was evaluated for a substance-use disorder and advised to continue his \nabstinence and only seek counseling if he had difficulty complying. Applicant has remained \nsober for over five years and has not had a recurrence of criminal or alcohol-related \n\n5 \n \nincidents. I have sufficient evidence to determine that Applicant\u2019s criminal and alcohol-\nrelated misconduct is unlikely to recur and that his alcohol use is now under control. \nApplicant provided sufficient documentary evidence showing that he does not display any \nsymptoms of having a substance-use disorder and that counseling is not recommended \nunless he is unable to maintain abstinence. \n \nAlcohol Abuse \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 4 describes the concern: \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to believe, based \non the nature or duration of the individual\u2019s alcohol abuse without evidence of substantial \nrehabilitation, that issuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk. \n \nAn individual\u2019s abuse of alcohol may put people, property, or information systems at \nrisk. Alcohol abuse can lead to the exercise of questionable judgment or failure to control \nimpulses, and may put people, property, or information systems at risk, regardless of \nwhether he or she is diagnosed as an abuser of alcohol or alcohol dependent. A person\u2019s \nlong-term abuse of alcohol without evidence of substantial rehabilitation may indicate that \ngranting a CAC poses an unacceptable safety risk in a U.S. Government facility. \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 4b, lists conditions that raise a CAC concern \nand may be disqualifying: \n \n(1) A pattern of alcohol-related arrests. \n \nAs described above, Applicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents resulting in \ncriminal conduct. SAS \u00b6 4b(1) applies because Applicant has a pattern of alcohol-related \narrests. \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 4c, lists three conditions that could mitigate \nconcerns about \u201cwhether there is a reasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable \nrisk\u201d: \n \n(1) The individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an abuser of alcohol);\n \n(2) The individual is participating in counseling or treatment programs, has \nno history of previous treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress; and \n \n(3) The individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare. He or she has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \n\n \n6 \nparticipation in an alcohol treatment program. The individual has received a \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program. \n \nApplicant has acknowledged his alcohol problems and testified to self-abstaining \nfrom alcohol use since 2013. His character letters, medical evaluation, and testimony \nsupport his abstinence for over five years, remorse for his past behavior, and a change \nin lifestyle. As stated above, Applicant was evaluated for a substance-use disorder and \nadvised to continue his abstinence from alcohol and to seek counseling only if he had \ndifficulty complying. I find that SAS \u00b6\u00b6 4c(1) and (2) apply, and 4c(3) partially applies. \n \nMisconduct or Negligence in Employment \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 1 describes concerns that arise from \nmisconduct or negligence in employment. The SOR allegations raise criminal and alcohol \nrelated issues that resulted in termination from employment, but did not arise while at \nwork nor were they directly related to actions during work. Based on the facts of this case, \nI determine that Applicant\u2019s conduct resulted in his termination, but did not directly \nimplicate standards described under SAS \u00b6 1. Therefore, SOR \u00b6 3.a is unfounded.  \n \n \nI have carefully considered all of the facts of this case and applied the adjudicative \nand whole-person standards in DODI 5200.46. Based on the record and Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, there is sufficient evidence to find that the behavior leading to the denial of \nApplicant\u2019s CAC eligibility has been overcome and that he no longer poses an \nunacceptable risk. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n Paragraph 1, Criminal or Dishonest Conduct:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Alcohol Abuse: \n \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Misconduct or Negligence in Employment: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, granting Applicant CAC eligibility does not pose \nan unacceptable risk. CAC eligibility is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Answer.) The case was assigned to me on September 14, \n2017. Due to Applicant\u2019s location in The Republic of Korea, he asked that a notice of \nhearing not be issued until April of 2018. As a result, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on April 24, 2018, scheduling the \n                                                          \n1 I considered the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new \nAdjudicative Guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. My decision would be the same if the case was \nconsidered under the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006. \n\n \n2 \n \nhearing for May 23, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government \noffered Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection, and Hearing \nExhibit (HX) I for Administrative Notice. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \npresented one document, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppXs) A. The record \nwas left open for an additional two months until July 23, 2018, for receipt of additional \ndocumentation. Applicant submitted no additional evidence, only a one page closing \nstatement. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on June 8, 2016. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Philippines. Department Counsel provided a five-page summary of \nthe facts, supported by Government documents pertaining to the Philippines, identified \nas HE I. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \nout in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR, with explanations. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 14.) He has been employed with the defense contractor \u201csince November 2016.\u201d  \n(TR at page 13 line 21 to page 16 line 11.) Previously divorced \u201cin 2014,\u201d he is now \nmarried to a Philippine national, and has two children from his previous marriage. (Id.) \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \n1.a. and 1.d. Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of the Philippines, but resides with \nApplicant in Korea. (TR at page 16 line 19 to page 18 line 21, and at page 35 lines \n5~11.) He gives his wife about $250 each month which she deposits in a Philippine \nbank account. (Id.) \n \n \n1.b., and 1.c. Applicant father-in-law \u201cpassed away\u201d in 2017, and his mother-in-\nlaw \u201cis a homemaker.\u201d He currently provides no financial support for his mother-in-law, \nwho plans to join her sister in the United States. (TR at page 19 line 3 to page 20 line \n22, and at page 23 lines 2~13.)  Applicant\u2019s seven brothers-in-law and two sisters-in-law \n\u201clive in the mountains.\u201d (TR at page 19 line 3 to page 20 line 22.) The men work \u201ca little \nconstruction, [and] farm work,\u201d while the women \u201cwash clothes for money.\u201d (TR at page \n34 line 8 to page 35 line 11.) \u201cThey [all] think . . . [Applicant fixes] electronics.\u201d (TR at \npage 22 line 23 to page 23 line 1.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.e. Applicant only owns property in the Philippines, worth about $18,000, where \nhe plans to \u201cretire\u201d in about 15~20 years. He does not own any property in the United \nStates. (TR at page 21 line 12 to page 22 line 22.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant attributes his current financial difficulties to the hospitalization of his \nformer spouse, his subsequent divorce, a cut in pay, and a personal bout with stomach \ncancer. (TR at page 26 line 11 to page 27 line 15, and at page 38 line 16 to page 40 line \n25.) \n \n \n2.a. Applicant has filed his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 and \n2015, as evidenced by documentation included in his Answer to the SOR. (TR at page \n25 line 25 to page 26 line 10, at page 27 line 19 to page 28 line 15, and Answer.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n2.b.  Applicant owes a past-due debt to the Army and Air Force  Exchange \nService (AFES) in the amount of about $11,000. (TR at page 28 lines 16~21, and at \npage 37 lines 5~20.) Despite having two months after his hearing to do so, Applicant \nhas provided nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n2.c., 2.e., and 2.f.  Applicant owes three past-due debts to a credit union in the \namount of about $21,000. (TR at page 28 line 22 to page 31 line 4, at page 32 line 3 to \npage 35 line 8, and at page 36 line 12 to page 37 line 4.) Despite having two months \nafter his hearing to do so, Applicant has provided nothing further in this regard. These \nallegations are found against Applicant. \n \n \n2.d. Applicant has paid a $532 past-due debt on an automobile loan, as \nevidenced by documentation showing this automobile has been sold. (TR at page 31 \nlines 5~17, and AppX A.) This allegation is found for Applicant.  \n \n \nNotice \n \n \nI take administrative notice of certain facts relating to the Philippines: the United \nStates continues to work with the Philippine government to monitor and investigate \ngroups engaged in or supporting terrorist activities in the Philippines. The Philippine \ngovernment is also currently engaged in a nationwide counter-narcotics campaign. \nExtrajudicial killings have been the chief human rights concern in the Philippines. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n\n \n5 \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Philippine national. He gives her monies each month, which \nshe deposits in a Philippine back account. Applicant only owns property in the \nPhilippines, and plans to retire there. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nNone of these apply. Apart from his U.S. citizenship and his job position, much of \nApplicant\u2019s emotional interest, and all of his property interest appears to reside in the \nPhilippines. Guideline B is found against Applicant.  \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. Although Applicant can attribute much of his debt to circumstances \nlargely beyond his control, he has about $30,000 in past-due debt that he has yet to \n\n \n8 \n \naddress. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. Guideline F is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Foreign \nInfluence and Financial Consideration security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Satterberg, Jr., Esq., Applicant\u2019s Counsel \n \n \nDecember 18, 2018 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 31, 2017, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline B.1 The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 13, 2017, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to another Administrative \nJudge, and the hearing originally convened on September 15, 2017. (Transcript \n(TR#1.)) As it was unclear if Applicant received the Government\u2019s \u201cdiscovery package,\u201d \nthe hearing was continued. (TR#1 at page 20 line 19 to page 23 line 16.) This matter \n                                                          \n1 I considered the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new \nAdjudicative Guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. My decision would be the same if the case was \nconsidered under the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006. \n\n \n2 \n \nwas subsequently reassigned to me on December 13, 2017. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) had already issued a notice of hearing on October 27, \n2017, scheduling the hearing for January 9, 2018. The hearing was convened as \nrescheduled. The Government reoffered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted without objection, and GXs 4 and 5 for Administrative Notice. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf. The record was left open until February 9, 2018, for receipt \nof additional documentation.  DOHA received the second transcript of the hearing \n(TR#2) on January 18, 2018. Applicant offered three sets of documents, which I marked \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through C, which were admitted without objection. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Russia and to Ukraine, identified as GXs 4 and 5.  The documents \nprovide elaboration and context for the summaries. I take administrative notice of the \nfacts as they relate to Ukraine included in the U.S. Government reports. (After a careful \nreview of the evidence, it is clear that Applicant, his siblings and his mother-in-law have \nno connection with Russia.) They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.e, with some \nexplanation. He denied SOR allegation \u00b6 1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 12.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2010. (GX 1 at page \n12.) Applicant emigrated from what is now Ukraine (formerly part of the Soviet Union), \nand became a U.S. citizen in December of 1991. (GX 1 at pages 6~7, and TR#2 at \npage 7 lines 18~20.)  He is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen who also emigrated \nfrom Ukraine. (GX 1 at pages 20~21.) Applicant has four adult children, and a 13 year-\nold son. (GX 1 at pages 23.) Both Applicant\u2019s father and an uncle, because of their \nPentecostal religious beliefs, were sent to Soviet prisons where they perished. (TR#2 at \npage 8 line 18 to page 9 line 23~27.) Applicant is a \u201cdeacon\u201d for his Pentecostal church, \nas evidenced by a letter from his \u201cPastor.\u201d (AppX C at page 2.) Applicant net worth in \nthe United States is about $400,000. (TR#2 at page 40 lines 6~17.) \n \n \n1.a. and 1.d. Applicant brother, who is married to a German national, is a dual \nnational of Germany and Ukraine. (TR#2 at page 16 line 11 to page 17 line 10, and at \npage 17 line 25 to page 26 line 14.) This brother is a Pentecostal missionary, who at \ntimes travels to Russia, but presently resides \u201cin Estonia or Latvia.\u201d (TR#2 at page 26 \nlines 7~14.) Since about 2007, Applicant has provided about $100 each month in \nfinancial support for his missionary brother. (TR#2 at page 16 line 11 to page 17 line 10, \nand at page 17 line 25 to page 26 line 14.) In 2013, Applicant also provided this brother \nwith a lump sum, one-time $5,000 gift. (Id.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.b. Applicant\u2019s other brother, and his two sisters, are citizens and residents of \nUkraine. (TR#2 at page 26 line 15 to page 33 line 5.) His brother \u201cis working \nconstruction\u201d in Germany.  (TR#2 at page 26 line 15 to page 27 line 22.) Applicant\u2019s two \nsisters are both housewives living in the Ukraine. One is the mother of \u201c18 kids,\u201d and the \nother \u201chad 11\u201d children. (TR#2 at page 26 line 15 to page 33 line 5.) None of these \nsiblings have any connection with the Ukrainian government. \n \n \n1.c. and 1.e. Applicant\u2019s 77 year-old mother-in-law is a \u201cretired\u201d citizen and \nresident of the Ukraine (TR#2 at page 33 line 7 to page 35 line 12.) Since about 1994, \nApplicant, through his wife, has provided about $100 each month in financial support for \nhis mother-in-law. (TR#2 at page 17 lines 10~21.) Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has no \nconnection with the Ukrainian government. \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admits that he was investigated in 2015 for possible connections \nwith a Russian/Armenian criminal organization. (TR#2 at page 22 lines 4~19, at page 39 \nline 8 to page 40 line 5, and GX 2.) No such connection was found, and Applicant \ndenies any such connection. (Id.) \n \nNotice \n \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: Ukraine is a republic with a \nsemi-presidential political system. In 2014, the Ukrainian parliament approved a new \ngovernment, which caused Russia to respond by seizing Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula. \nAdditional unrest occurred in 2014, involving thousands of pro-Russian protesters in \neastern and southern Ukraine. In 2015, a ceasefire agreement established a de facto \ndividing line between Ukrainian government-controlled and separatist-held areas in \nUkraine. (GX 5.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n\n \n4 \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant has three siblings and a mother-in-law who are citizens of and reside in \nUkraine. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s loyalties are clearly to the United States, where his immediate family \nlives, and of which he has been a citizen since 1991. Guideline B is found for Applicant.  \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n6 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and C in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected by those who know him in the workplace and in his community. (AppXs \nA~C.) He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States \ndue to his longstanding ties here.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017.  In a July 27, 2017, response, \nApplicant answered the allegations and requested a hearing before a Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned the case on June \n12, 2018.  \nA June 19, 2018, notice was issued which set the hearing for August 23, 2018. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered four documents, \naccepted into the record without objection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-4. Applicant offered \ntestimony and six exhibits, accepted without objection as Exs. A-F. The Government \nobjected to a seventh offering, a report of a polygraph examination. The objection was \nsustained and the summary was not accepted. (Tr. 20-25) The record was held open \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nthrough July 5, 2018, in the event either party wished to submit additional materials. The \ntranscript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on September 4, 2018.  \n \nLacking objection, Applicant\u2019s request to extend the time period for supplemental \nexhibits through October 15, 2018, was granted. On September 26, 2018, Applicant \nsubmitted a package of 26 additional exhibits. The Government objected to two items \n(numbers 24 and 25). With no response forthcoming within 15 days, the objections were \nsustained. The materials were accepted as Exs. G1-G23 and G26). The record was \nclosed on October 15, 2018. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, \nI find Applicant mitigated sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old graduate of one of the U.S. military academies. He \nhonorably served in the U.S. military for approximately 27 years. He is presently a \nsenior account manager.

(Tr. 60) She \nalso did not like that Applicant was a disciplinarian. (Tr. 57). Meanwhile, she was having \ndifficult times fitting in with the other girls at church and at school, and was often bullied. \n(Tr. 59) The child also had the stress or adjusting to Type 1 diabetes, and trauma that \nwas the result of a life-threatening car accident a couple of years earlier. (Tr. 59-60) She \nwas known to suffer from depression. (Tr. 62) She wanted to go back to her former \nstate and life with her natural father.  \n \nAt age 14, amidst all these problems, this eldest daughter was sleeping on the \nground in a basement bedroom one night. (Tr. 59) She was positioned on the floor next \nto her sleeping sister\u2019s bed. Applicant entered to look in on the children. In reaching out \nto assure she was well-covered and tucked in, his hand made contact with her \nbackside, feeling to her \u201clike a grab over her clothing.\u201d (Tr. 55, 58, 64) The next day, the \ngirl was brought home from school for being distraught. The girl \u201cblew up\u201d at Applicant, \nbut did not accuse him of anything. A day later, the mother read a passage in the girl\u2019s \njournal mentioning the touch. \u201cBy then, [the girl had] decided to move [across country \nwith her biological father].\u201d (Tr 56) Over time, the daughter\u2019s story has changed multiple \ntimes. (see, e.g., Exs. G10-G13; Ex. 3 at 12-13) She later acknowledged that the touch \n\u201cwasn\u2019t a sexual thing.\u201d (Tr. 58)  \n \nIn 2011, the girl subsequently chose to live with Applicant during college despite \nthe availability of GI Bill benefits that could have paid for her housing elsewhere. (Tr. 61) \nNo formal steps regarding this girl\u2019s allegation were ever pursued or instituted. (Tr. 71) \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nAt a recent family funeral, this oldest child \u201ccame up, gave [him] a hug . . . even before, \nshe was not much into that, but she came up and gave [him] a hug.\u201d (Tr. 73) They were \nalso last known to be exchanging Facebook posts and emails. (Tr. 73) \n \n \nIn 2011, the middle child of Applicant\u2019s three stepdaughters traveled cross \ncountry to stay with her biological father for part of the summer. The girl enjoyed life with \nher biological father in a markedly different region, where her now-adult elder sister had \nlived since 2009 and where this girl had spent her early years. Also residing in the area \nwas an aunt and a cousin, who was the girl\u2019s best friend. The aunt had never approved \nof Applicant, resented his taking his wife and his wife\u2019s children away from her and the \nbiological father, and \u201ceventually was convinced to help [the biological father] to get his \nchildren back under his complete care. . . .\u201d (Ex. 9)   \n \nThe middle girl initially delayed her relocation by not coming home at summer\u2019s \nend. Then, the girl and the aunt disclosed that the child had \u201csuppressed memories\u201d \nindicating Applicant had molested her. She told this to her biological father, who was not \non good terms with Applicant. (Tr. 54) It is unknown whether this middle child had \nactually read her elder sister\u2019s journal or simply knew the circumstances of her \ndeparture from Applicant\u2019s home three years earlier. (Tr. 68-69) \n \nThere was subsequent concern about the middle child returning to live with \nApplicant. The girl\u2019s biological father reported his daughter\u2019s \u201csuppressed memories\u201d to \nthe local police. This stepdaughter later detailed to county sheriff officials instances \nwhere Applicant supposedly touched her breasts and genitals in a manner \u201cessentially \nvery strikingly familiar to [her elder sister\u2019s] allegation from 2009,\u201d wherein Applicant \nwas to have touched the sleeping girl after moving her blanket, then tucked her in for \nthe night. (Tr. 66) She also suggested that her younger sister had been similarly \nabused. (see, e.g., Ex. 3 at 6; Ex. G(18)) \n \nAfter an investigation and review, no action was taken by the police, but this \nmiddle child remained with her biological father for the rest of her high school education. \nThere, \u201cshe joined the same choir group, she . . . went to work at the same pizza place, \nshe did almost everything step by step that [her elder sister] did when she moved. . . .\u201d \n(Tr. 67, 69-70) Last seen a year ago, this stepdaughter and Applicant were on speaking \nterms during a family visit. (Tr. 73)  \n \nThe youngest stepdaughter does not believe her sisters\u2019 versions of the facts \nconcerning the Applicant. She has consistently defended Applicant since at least 2012. \n(Exs. 7-9) She describes him as a committed member of their church, patriotic, patient, \neven-tempered, and a loving father who \u201cprovides just punishments.\u201d (Ex. 9) She \ndescribes Applicant and her mother as \u201cloving parents.\u201d (Exs. 7-9) She does not believe \nher elder sister\u2019s story, noting that this sibling \u201cwould have reacted sooner\u201d if the alleged \nincident had really occurred. (Ex. G8) She noted that this sibling originally questioned \nwhether the incident had ever really happened. (Ex. G8)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nThe youngest stepdaughter also noted that the elder sibling told at least two \nversions of what happened: \u201cin one, my dear mother walked in; in the other, I told \n[mother of the incident along] with [my elder sister]. Two stories hints that this is a \nfalsehood.\u201d (Ex. G8; see also Tr. 81-82) As for the former version, she noted \u201cthe very \nidea that my mother would stand by and watch her children be practically raped is \ncomplete rubbish.\u201d (Ex. G8) The elder sister had confided to the youngest girl that she \nhad actually wanted to go to be with their father because \u201cshe was lonely and did not \nenjoy life in [their state], especially because she left many friends behind when [they] \nmoved . . . . The change was too drastic for her. She also in her diary has written how \nshe hates flying back and forth every school break; how she wished she had a normal \nlife in a permanent home. I know she didn\u2019t go to [their biological father] for a safe \nhaven.\u201d (Ex. G8) In the alternative, the youngest girl suggests that, given her eldest \nsister\u2019s track record of having bad dreams, that such a dream could have also been \nused as a basis for manipulation by her cousin or aunt. (Ex. G9) \n \nThe youngest child also related that Applicant often tucked the children in. \nHowever, after the allegation waged by the elder stepdaughter, he stopped. (Ex.G 8; Tr. \n73) Overall, she noted that Applicant always tried to avoid being \u201ccreepy\u201d or an \u201cevil \nstepparent.\u201d (Ex. G9) This stepdaughter also reported that the aunt \u201coften tried to tear \napart [my] family and others. She would tell the kids to lie to the school or officials about \nour parents [Applicant and his wife]. . . . She may hate my parents.\u201d (Ex. G9) This \nstepdaughter\u2019s support of Applicant is corroborated by her mother, Applicant\u2019s wife. (Ex. \nG15) Today, the three stepdaughters are all adults living independently apart from \nApplicant. \n \n \nRegarding the incidents allegedly involving the oldest and middle stepdaughters, \na report from military legal/social services was deemed in favor of Applicant, with the \nfavorable testimony of the oldest and youngest girls found to be substantiated. There \nwas no referral to the sheriff or for criminal proceedings. Although not introduced into \nevidence, other documentation reflects that a family advocacy study adopted the stories \nby the oldest and the middle girl and found against Applicant, finding their tales \nsubstantiated. There is no documentary evidence reflecting a recommendation on \ncriminal action was issued, although it was noted that the youngest girl remained \ncontentedly in the care of Applicant. The unfavorable conclusion of the family advocacy \nprogram was the basis for the pending allegation in this matter. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to the AG, \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept, each of which must be fully considered in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Any doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility and will be \nresolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only \nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the record evidence. \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted \nfacts alleged in the SOR. Under the Directive, an applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. Decisions include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nDecisions are in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination \nas to the loyalty of the applicant.   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior  \n \nAG \u00b6 12 sets forth the security concern as follows:  \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s hand made contact with his middle stepdaughter\u2019s buttock one night \nas she slept, leading to the involvement of military legal/social services, a family \nadvocacy program, and the police. The family advocacy program found that two of three \nallegations raised were substantiated. Those allegations both involved similar fact \npatterns concerning Applicant\u2019s eldest and middle stepdaughters.   \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides conditions that could raise a disqualifying condition:  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nAG \u00b6 13(a):  sexual behavior of a criminal nature . . . ; \n \nAG \u00b6 13(b): pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; \n \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 13(d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment.  \n \nUnder these circumstances, AG \u00b6 13(a) - AG \u00b6 13(c) apply. \n \nIn addition, AG \u00b6 14 provides the following possible mitigating conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(a): the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and \nthere is no evidence of subsequent conduct of similar nature;  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; \n \nAG \u00b6 14(d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and \ndiscreet; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate \nprogram of treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has \nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional \nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment.  \n \nThe behavior at issue occurred seven or more years ago. Once it became an \nissue, Applicant ceased checking in on the girls at night or tucking them in. The females \ninvolved are now adults living outside of the region where Applicant resides. There is no \nother indication involving any questionable actions by Applicant regarding the other six, \nyounger, children, or any other individuals of any age or sex. Applicant has the full \nsupport of his youngest stepdaughter and his wife. He has been candid and forthcoming \nabout his family and these incidents since the beginning.  \n \nIt is true that one of three investigations found the stories of two of the three \nstepdaughters to be substantiated. No further action, however, was taken despite its \nconclusion and the youngest girl continued to live with her stepfather, the Applicant. The \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nfacts in this matter have been fully vetted through multiple criminal or administrative \nfunctions. Of all the several characters in the drama, only the testimonies of Applicant \nand the youngest stepdaughter remain consistent; in contrast, the tales told by the older \ntwo stepdaughters have varied and evolved almost from the beginning. Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s subtle suggestion that the two older stepdaughters were troubled teens \nplotting a way to go back to a happier time and place In light of these facts is not \nunpersuasive. Therefore, I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(a)-(c) apply.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe facts at issue under this guideline are the same as those at issue under the \nprevious guideline and are adopted herein. Those facts raise disqualifying condition:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:   \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c):  evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.   \n \n \nFor the same reasons noted under Guideline D, above, I find AG \u00b6 32(a), AG \u00b6 \n32(c), and AG \u00b6 32(d) apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \n \nThe same facts noted under the two previous guidelines are equally applicable \nunder this section. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(e) applies. Moreover, I have considered these \nfacts in light of the AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions. I find the following potentially \napplicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nFor the same reasons stated above under both of the previously discussed \nguidelines, I find these two mitigating conditions apply. I find this conclusion bolstered \nby the fact Applicant ceased checking in on the children in the evening so as not to \nhave his paternal actions misunderstood. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under the three \napplicable guidelines in my analysis of Applicant\u2019s whole-person. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, materials, and references.  \n\n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nThe facts in this case reflect that Applicant\u2019s eldest and middle stepdaughters \nwere unhappy with the milieu into which their mother\u2019s marriage placed them, far from \ntheir prior residence, biological father, school, church, and friends. Both girls very much \nwanted to return to their old lives and their old haunts. The oldest sister\u2019s version of an \ninappropriate touching has varied over the years, and rational alternative explanations \nhave been explored that further raise questions over her original allegation of abuse. \nFurthermore, the lack of candor by the two older girls; their fundamental dislike of \nApplicant; and the dislike of Applicant by the girls\u2019 aunt which could well have \ntransitioned into unconscionable coaching, provide substantial doubt that the alleged \nconduct actually occurred as described.    \n  \n \nThe middle girl\u2019s version of abuse came at a particularly difficult time in her life. It \ninvolved a scenario similar to that alleged by the elder sister, a scenario she saw \nsuccessfully relocate her elder sister back to their former home state of residence. The \nmiddle girl\u2019s version of abuse was less subtle, and she even falsely asserted her \nyounger sister had similarly been violated. With regard to all these allegations, the \nyoungest stepdaughter\u2019s information credibly refutes or questions both the claims and \nthe motives, of not just the girls, but their aunt and cousin, as well.  \n \n \nThe SOR allegations are correct in noting that one investigative body found that \nthe older and middle sisters\u2019 stories were substantiated. Another investigation, however, \nfound against the middle sister and in favor of testimony by the youngest girl and the \n(revised) version of the elder sister\u2019s tale. Taken together, in historical context, and \nupon review of subsequent interactions between Applicant, his wife, and the sisters, the \nyoungest girl\u2019s theories and explanations make the most sense out of this mixture of \nvarying facts, both then and now. More importantly, they support Applicant\u2019s assertion \nthat there was no intentional criminal or sexual abuse inflicted on either girl. Based on \nthe documentary evidence and testimony provided, I conclude sexual behavior, criminal \nconduct, and personal conduct security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n10\n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Although born in the United States, Applicant\u2019s family is from a foreign country, where he spent many years in school.3 After five years of diligent study at university in the United States, Applicant thought he had graduated in the spring of 2000. He had timely completed his final semester\u2019s coursework and received final grades for his courses. He applied and was permitted to participate in spring commencement exercises.

He also requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned the case on February 22, 2018. A \nhearing originally scheduled for May 9, 2018, was cancelled to give Applicant more time \nto retain an attorney. A May 10, 2918, notice, setting the hearing for June 11, 2018 was \nissued. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \nThe Government offered eight documents, accepted into the record as exhibits \n(Exs. 1-8).

The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 20, 2018. \nThree character references and a page of argument were timely received and accepted \ninto the record as Exs. J-M without objection. The record was then closed on July 23, \n2018. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed \nto mitigate personal conduct security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old senior professional engineer who has worked for the \nsame employer for four years. He has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and is presently \nworking on a master\u2019s degree. Applicant is married with two minor children.  Although \nborn in the United States, Applicant\u2019s family is from a foreign country, where he spent \nmany years in school.3 \n \n \nAfter five years of diligent study at university in the United States, Applicant \nthought he had graduated in the spring of 2000.

This time, he was told \nhe could not enroll in graduate courses because he did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nFor years, he tried to reconcile this confusion, which appeared to be related to money \nowed the university. It appears between 2000 and 2003, whatever issues barring his \nunconditional graduation that existed had become a major obstacle.  \n \nMeanwhile, in 2003, Applicant married his pregnant girlfriend, the couple had a \nchild, his wife went back to school, and Applicant needed to find a way to support his \nfamily. Specifically, \u201che needed to be able to earn the amount he should have been \nentitled to for finishing his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree which he would\u2019ve finished at \nthe time had he not been denied the bachelor\u2019s degree.\u201d (Tr. 19)  \n                                                          \n2 Regarding the objections to Ex. 6, it was taken into evidence but is accordingly given appropriate weight \nunder the circumstances. It is also noted that Applicant volunteered portions of the exhibit during his \ndirect testimony. \n \n3 This fact is potentially relevant given any cultural or linguistic issues that may have arisen with regard to \nGuideline E. However, it is also noted that his several siblings are all graduates of U.S. universities. \n \n4 SOR allegation 1.a. Applicant was not enrolled in the graduate program, but the school permitted \nstudents to take two or three course offerings before applying for acceptance into the program. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nIn 2006, Applicant falsified multiple documents from the university indicating he \nhad both a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree in engineering.5 (Tr. 46, 70) He \nthen used those documents to apply for a job, which was later offered and accepted.6 In \n2009, Applicant\u2019s falsity was caught during a government background investigation.7 \nApplicant confessed the truth to both his employer and the government. Applicant\u2019s \nmanager expressed his displeasure at these developments, noting he needed a degree \nto continue with the company. The two discussed the time Applicant should resign and \nfinish his degree. (Tr. 19) There is no documentary evidence reflecting a formal letter of \nresignation or notice. He did not want to attend an up-coming meeting where he would \nnow be viewed as only a high school graduate. A week later, however, he received a \ncertified letter reflecting that upper management had made the decision to terminate \nhim. Apparently, word of this agreement was not well-spread. Around that time, a co-\nworker wrote an email to another colleague noting that Applicant had simply \n\u201cdisappeared\u201d over a week prior and was no longer working at the company. (Ex. D) \n \nAfter he completed the bachelor\u2019s degree, Applicant knew he wanted to obtain a \ngraduate degree from the same institution. He updated his resume to indicate a \nmaster\u2019s degree with an anticipated graduation date in the future. He was not then \nenrolled in the master\u2019s program. That section of the resume, submitted to his next \nemployer in October 2006, stated: \n \nEDUCATION: MS (Engineering; University; City) May 2003 \n   \n  BS (Engineering; University; City) May 20008 \n \nIn 2014, Applicant submitted a resume to his then-prospective employer that stated: 9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      EDUCATION \n                                                         (University; City) \n \n \n \n      Master of Science in Electrical Engineering \n \n \n \n \n           Expected May 2018 \n \n \n    Concentration in Communications and Signal Processing \n \n \n                                                          \n5 When asked why he also falsified having earned a master\u2019s degree, Applicant stated: \u201cI would have \nbeen done with a master\u2019s [degree] by that time had things not gone the way they did at [his \nundergraduate school] the first time. And I spoke to the hiring manager . . . and I realized having a \nmaster\u2019s degree would make [my] case a lot better.\u201d (Tr. 48) \n \n6 SOR allegation 1.b. These included falsified academic transcripts, resume, and application. \n \n7 Compare Ex. 6 at 3, Applicant noted that he \u201cmisled the [company] into believing I had a college degree \nfrom [ ] This came to light during my 2008 (5 year) investigation to renew my clearance.\u201d (emphasis \nadded) \n \n8 Ex. 3. \n \n9 Ex. 4. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n   (University; City) \n \n \n \n    Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering \n \n \n \n \n \n         May 2013 \n \nIn fact, at the time, Applicant was not enrolled in a master\u2019s program at that university.10 \n \nApplicant testified that he did not mean his resume wording to imply he was \nactually enrolled in a master\u2019s program at that university. (Tr. 53) He was told by a \n\u201cprofessional\u201d that this was but a way to let prospective employers \u201cknow that you intend \nto get a master\u2019s degree or you\u2019re taking graduate level course [sic] and you intend to \nget a master\u2019s degree.\u201d (Tr. 53) He was told that the wording \u201clet\u2019s them know you don\u2019t \nhave a degree but you have started the process.\u201d (Tr. 54) It is unclear how not having \nfirst been enrolled in the program started the process of earning a graduate degree. \nLater, Applicant told the hiring partner that he was not yet in the master\u2019s degree \nprogram. (Ex. B) Ultimately, Applicant was offered his present position, where he has \nbeen a well-regarded employee. \n \nIn July 2014, Applicant certified a security clearance application (SCA) in which \nhe stated he left his employer in 2009 by mutual agreement, rather than by unilateral \ntermination by upper management.11 Applicant maintains that he believes the facts \nreflect that the agreement between himself and his manager show his departure was \nmeant to be as they had contemplated: that he would leave the office and return to \nschool. A week later, he received the certified letter from higher management that he \nwas terminated for violating company policy. No formal charges were filed against him. \n(Tr. 61) He feels it is unfair that the employer should be able to dictate the terms of his \ndeparture from their company after he and his immediate manager had already \ndiscussed the issue. (Tr. 62) \n \nDuring a personal subject interview in May 2015, Applicant stated that he was \nonly asked whether he had a college degree after he was hired in 2006. The interviewer \nnever mentioned the falsified application, academic transcript, and resume included in \nhis application submission documents.12 Applicant points to Ex. E to show the \ninterviewer only made notes regarding Applicant\u2019s comments regarding the fact he did \nnot have the degree. Because the interviewer\u2019s notes do not inquire about the falsified \napplication, transcript, and resume, Applicant believes he did his duty and the \ninterviewer failed to ask about those documents. He takes no responsibility for \nneglecting to disclose the falsifications he omitted or obscured. In that same interview, \nApplicant failed to disclose that he was terminated by management, not simply left by \n                                                          \n10 SOR allegation 1.c. Applicant is still working on this master\u2019s degree at this time.  \n \n11 SOR allegation 1.d. In that application, Applicant did note that he left under allegations of misconduct. \n \n12 SOR allegation 1.e. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nmutual agreement.13 He did so because he still does not view management\u2019s letter to \nbe the formal or official action for his departure or for violating company policy. \n \nAside from issues related to personal conduct, three delinquent debts are noted \nin the SOR (2.a-2.c). They are student loans amounting to approximately $41,200. At \nsome point after the summer of 2000, Applicant got a job that would enable him to make \npayments on his student loans. He then started making payments on them after they \nwere no longer in deferment status. When subject to a layoff in December 2001, \nApplicant became delinquent on the loans and they went back into deferment. When \nagain employed, he resumed payments until June 2009, when he again defaulted on \nthe loans after leaving a job. (Tr. 32) He then returned to school later that year while \nunemployed, and did so without taking any additional loans.  \n \nThe family relied on Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s income and Applicant\u2019s retirement account \nand investments, which were liquidated. Applicant attributes his acquisition of the \ndelinquent debts to financial stress experienced during this nearly five-year time span \nstudying and not working. He has since had one loan put into rehabilitation and the \nother two consolidated with that loan. Therefore, he is now dealing with only one lender. \n(Tr. 37) Applicant provided a payment history going back to May 2018. (Exs. F-G) The \nlender is now being paid $252.72 a month for his loan balance. The loans are now in \ntimely repayment. (Exs. F-G)   \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision after a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Any doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility and will be \nresolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only \nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the record evidence. \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted \nfacts alleged in the SOR. Under the Directive, an applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \n                                                          \n13 SOR allegation 1.f. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in those to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nsafeguard classified information. Decisions are in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. Here, Applicant denied making certain falsifications or strategic omissions \non his SCAs, on job application materials, and during a May 2015 personal subject \ninterview. If Applicant\u2019s answers and materials were intentionally false or meant to \nmislead or misrepresent, the following disqualifying conditions could apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security \nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative; and \n \n AG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \nI find that several of the untrue, inconsistent, or omitted facts were intentionally \nput forth to set Applicant in a better light. The first issue arose on Applicant\u2019s 2001 SCA, \nin which he wrote he had graduated from a particular university with a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin May 2000. Applicant believed he had graduated at that ceremony because he had \ncompleted his coursework, was given permission to attend commencement exercises, \nwalked the stage in cap and gown, and was given a token of some sort. Then \nunbeknownst to him was the fact he apparently had an outstanding financial issue that \nhad to be addressed before he could formally be considered a graduate.  \n \n \nApparently, Applicant was unaware that occasions arise when one is given the \nopportunity to go through the motions of graduation with one\u2019s peers before all \ngraduation criteria have been met, such as when there is an unpaid balance, health \nissue, or missing academic credit. Apparently, Applicant failed to cross his \u201ct\u201ds and dot \nhis \u201ci\u201ds with this regard in the intervening year before he completed the SCA. On the \nother hand, it is not implausible that this situation was the result of naivet\u00e9. (SOR 1.a) \nApplicant fully admits, however, that he submitted a falsified application package to a \nprospective employer in 2006, a package including a falsified application, falsified \nacademic transcript, and a false and misleading resume. (SOR 1.b) \n \n \nAs part of an application package for a job in 2014, Applicant detailed under \n\u201cEDUCATION,\u201d the name and city of a university, \u201cMaster of Science in Electrical \nEngineering, Expected May 2018, Concentration in Communications and Signal \nProcessing. (SOR 1.c) Applicant dismisses this entry as merely a showing of his \nintention to pursue that degree, a tip-off to the prospective employer that it was his \nimmediate aim. He testified a professional gave him this explanation.  \n \nI disagree, however, as to how that advice was meant or implemented. Inclusion \nof an expected or anticipated graduation date for a future degree is predicated not on a \ndesire or hope, but on significant steps \u2013 ie. enrollment in the program and, perhaps, \nsome completed coursework. Here, Applicant was not enrolled in the master\u2019s program \nat that particular university. There is no documentary evidence reflecting that his \nenrollment had been initiated or was guaranteed. While Applicant was no doubt firm in \nhis commitment to seek that degree, obstacles to its fruition were still potentially ahead \nat that point. Given the conviction of his testimony on this point, however, I find he relied \non and misunderstood professional advice.  \n \n \nOn his July 2014 SCA, Applicant wrote that he left a job in 2009 by mutual \nagreement. (SOR 1.d) He maintains that is the fact, and stresses it despite other facts \nsurrounding his departure. He needed a bachelor\u2019s degree to maintain the job. He \ndiscussed his lack of a degree with immediate management and it was decided that he \nwould resign and pursue his bachelor\u2019s degree. Then, apparently, he disappeared; co-\nworker\u2019s were concerned at his disappearance. Applicant was embarrassed about \npotentially attending a meeting where it could be disclosed he only had a high school \ndiploma. A week after meeting with his manager, he received a certified letter from \nupper management that he was terminated for violating company policy.  \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nApplicant thinks it is unfair a company can dictate how his departure is \ncharacterized. There is no documentary evidence, however, showing that he formally \ndisputed or appealed this designation with human resources or a higher manager. \nInstead, he chose to move on accepting only his version of the facts. To do so was not \nonly at his own peril, but it shows a lack of acceptance to the facts here.  \n \n \nFinally, in a personal interview from May 2015, Applicant discussed the truth \nabout his alleged bachelor\u2019s degree graduation date, but failed to disclose the fact he \nhad also submitted to that employer falsified application materials, a falsified academic \ntranscript, and a falsified resume. (SOR 1.d) Applicant points to the investigator\u2019s notes \nand shows that there is no query by the investigator concerning those admittedly \nfalsified documents. Applicant misses the point. In concealing the information, the \ninvestigator had no basis upon which to pose questions regarding those documents. \nThis process demands honesty and candor; it relies on an applicant being forthcoming. \nHere, Applicant failed to meet those standards, and superior judgment should have told \nhim these were not insignificant or irrelevant facts. Moreover, in that same interview, \nApplicant again failed to discuss his termination in 2009 by upper management for a \npolicy violation, instead continuing to adhere to his original position that the first action \u2013 \ndiscussion with his immediate manager \u2013 trumped the official action taken by the \ncompany\u2019s hierarchy after he ceased reporting for work. (1.e)   \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhas three delinquent student loans. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \n                    The student loans at issue have been in and out of deferment on more than one \noccasion as various factors interrupted Applicant\u2019s education. The credit reports in \nevidence were apparently pulled during a period when Applicant was technically \ndelinquent on those accounts. It is hard to attribute their delinquency to conditions \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control if he truly left employment simply to return to school full time; \nif he was terminated from his job, AG \u00b6 20(b) could apply in part, although he presented \ndeficient evidence showing he acted responsibly during that period.  \n \n                    Moreover, there is no documentary evidence that Applicant tried to address these \ndebts before the issuance of the SOR in June 2017. Indeed, the payment history \nsubmitted only goes back to May 2018. Given the ultimate disposition of this case, \nhowever, and the fact these student loans are now in repayment, I find AG \u00b6 20(b) and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) both apply in part. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the her  \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those \nfactors. I am also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to \ngrant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased on careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old senior professional engineer who has worked for the \nsame employer for four years. He has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and is presently \nworking on a master\u2019s degree. Married, Applicant has two minor children. Over the past \nyears, Applicant has been in and out of college. As a result, his student loans have \nbeen in and out of deferment, rehabilitation, and in repayment. Last year, he had his \nthree student loans consolidated. They are now in timely repayment. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n10 \nWhat is most troublesome with Applicant\u2019s case is the matter of various \ninaccuracies or omissions related to SCAs, interviews, and job application. The most \nworrisome is the 2006 production of falsified student academic transcripts, an incorrect \nand misleading resume, and falsified application (1.b). This admitted and obviously \npurposeful maneuver casts a pale on Applicant\u2019s efforts to promote himself in a \nfavorable light. However, I do find it conceivable that two of the allegations could be \nbased on semantics or simple misunderstanding (1.a and 1.c).  \n \nThe falsifications alleged at 1.d-1.f, however, seem to fall into the same category \nas the one at 1.b. Indeed, it seems as if Applicant is either truly unaware of how the \narguments here stack up, or simply prefers to rely on an argument more beneficial to his \ncause. While that is his choice, it fails to explain away the alternative facts offered or the \nsecurity concerns they raise. Taking these factors together, I find that Applicant \nmitigated financial considerations security concerns, but failed to mitigate personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n   \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.d-f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nArthur E.

Her new last name is reflected \nin the caption.  \n12/21/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,2 on April 14, 2017, \nthe DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing financial considerations security \nconcerns. On May 1, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. On February 8, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \nscheduling a hearing that was conducted on March 1, 2018. \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through \n4, which were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant offered exhibits A \nthrough F, which were also admitted without objection. In February 2018 and August \n2018, she submitted additional documents, which were admitted as Ex. G through Ex. N. \nApplicant and her husband testified at the hearing. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on March 9, 2018. \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective \u201cfor \nall covered individuals\u201d on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility under the new AGs.3 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denies the allegations in SOR 1.e ($479) and SOR 1.x ($342). She \nadmitted, with explanation, the remaining allegations in SOR paragraphs 1.a through 1. \nbb. She was uncertain about the debt in SOR 1.w ($356), asserted she had paid the debts \nin SOR 1.m ($167) and SOR 1.t ($1,222), and had payment plans in place for the debts \nin SOR 1.j ($1497), SOR 1.k ($1,222), SOR 1.u ($697), and SOR 1.v ($647). She \nprovided no documentation showing payment on the debts or copies of the repayment \nagreements. After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old systems engineer working for a defense contractor since \nMay 2001. (Tr. 18) She seeks to retain a security clearance. Her annual salary is \napproximately $124,000. (Tr. 59) Her duty performance during the more than 17 year of \n                                                          \n2 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (Sept. 1, 2006 AG) effective \nwithin the DoD on September 1, 2006.  \n \n3 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in \nthis case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf. \n  \n\n \n3 \nworking for the defense contractor has been outstanding. Between August 2004 and June \n2017, she received numerous awards at work, which totaled in excess of $4,000. (Ex. E, \nEx M) Since 2003, her work performance has met or exceeded her employer\u2019s \nexpectations. For the last five years, her performance has been rated as exceeded or \nsignificantly exceeded. (Ex. L) In 2018, Applicant received an award in recognition of her \naccomplishments in science, technology, engineering and mathematics community. (Ex. \nN) She received the outstanding achievement award as a technology raising star. (Ex. N) \n \nIn January 2015, Applicant married. Her husband\u2019s annual salary is approximately \n$45,000 and he has worked for a government contractor since 2007. (Tr. 60, 64) He has \nadditional jobs: one as a referee, a second as a DJ, and does production work. (Tr. 62, \n64) The net monthly household take-home income is approximately $5,000. (Tr. 55) In \nMay 2000, Applicant received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. \nIn August 2005, she received her Master of Science degree in system engineering. She \nmarried in January 2015 and has a 19-year-old, who is a college student, a 7 year old, \nand a 10-year-old stepson. (Tr. 21) Her stepson lives with his mother. \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s February 2013 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) she listed a single medical debt of $919. (Ex. 1) She stated she was \nworking with the creditor and would be setting up a monthly payment to resolve the debt. \nHer February 2018 credit report listed six delinquent obligations: SOR 1.b ($11,724), SOR \n1.c ($11,436), SOR 1.d ($8,245), SOR 1.f ($972), SOR 1.g ($297), and SOR 1.j ($497). \nThese six obligations total $33,171. She asserted she had a debt payoff plan to address \n24 delinquent obligations listed. The payoff plan would address $40,230 in debt.  \n \nThe payoff plan was scheduled to start in June 2018, three months following the \nhearing, and anticipated to end in May 2019.The payoff plan estimated she which would \npay off the debt in SOR 1.j ($497) in September 2018, the debt in SOR 1.g ($528) in \nNovember 2018, and the debts in SOR 1.b ($12,377), 1.c ($11,437), and 1.d ($8,245) \nwould be paid in May 2019. (Ex. K) The plan also includes paying off 12 medical debts \nand seven other debts in additional to the five debts previously listed. (Ex. K) Applicant \ndid not provide any documentation showing that payments had been made in accord with \nthe plan.  \n \n \nApplicant experienced financial difficulties while a single mother raising her \ndaughter. She was not receiving financial assistance from her daughter\u2019s father. (Tr. 17, \n23) At that time, her student loans (SOR 1.a, $43,000 and SOR 1.bb).had been in \ndeferment status since 2010. (Tr. 24) She had paid $200 monthly on her student loans \nuntil they went into deferment status. (Tr. 25) When her deferment ended she expected \nto receive a letter from the company from which she obtained her student loans. (Tr. 25) \nShe did not know the loans had been transferred to another company for collection. (Tr. \n17) She received letters from the company then holding the student loan notes, but did \nnot respond to the letters wrongfully assuming the letters were letters of solicitation from \na company wishing to consolidate her student loan with that company. (SOR Response) \nShe did not believe the collection letters came from a company that held her student \nloans. \n\n \n4 \nIn June 2014, Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished to collect the funds she owed on \nher student loans. She was unaware of the transfer until her wages were involuntarily \ngarnished in the amount of $1,200 monthly. This amount was more than her monthly \nmortgage payments. She was unsuccessful in attempting to have the amount of the \nweekly garnishment lowered. The garnishment was 15 percent of her wages. (Tr. 27) \nWhile the garnishment was in place, she was unable to address any of her other debt. \n(Tr. 17)  \n \nIn December 2017, the last amount owed on Applicant student loans was \ngarnished from her wages. (Ex. J) Her student loan debt of $43,000 was then completely \npaid by the garnishment. (Tr. 28) Her February 2018 credit report lists a zero balance on \nher state guaranteed student loans and her educational financial accounts. (Ex.4) Her \nOctober 2015 credit report listed $38,237 in student loans. (Ex. 2) While her wages were \nbeing garnished, she was unable to address many of her financial obligations. \n \nApplicant had a $12,377 vehicle purchase account (SOR 1.b) charged off. In April \n2016, a hailstorm \u201ctotaled\u201d the vehicle. (Tr. 32) Her insurance coverage paid $5,000 on \nthe vehicle. She did not have gap insurance resulting in the $12,377 debt. (Tr. 33) She \nwas unable to address this debt while the garnishment was in place. Now that the \ngarnishment has ended, she has $1,200 monthly to address her other delinquent \naccounts. (Tr. 50) She asserts she intends to start addressing her delinquent debts. She \nprovided the payoff plan with payments to start in June 2018.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred an $11,4374 collection account (SOR 1.c). She is current on \nanother loan with the same creditor that has a loan balance of approximately $4,000. \nOnce that loan is paid, she asserted she will commence paying this debt. (Tr. 34) She \nhad a line of credit that resulted in the bank charging off $8,245 (SOR 1.d). She also had \na $972 credit card account (SOR 1.f) that was also charged off. (Tr. 37) In her SOR \nResponse, she indicated a repayment plan had been established to pay the debt. She \nalso stated in her SOR Response that \u201cpayment mitigation plans\u201d had been set up with \nthe creditors in: SOR 1.h, SOR 1.i, SOR 1, j, SOR 1.k, SOR 1.m. SOR 1.n, SOR 1.o, SOR \n1.t, SOR 1.u, SOR 1.v, SOR 1.w, SOR 1.y, SOR 1.z, and SOR 1.aa. The accounts went \ndelinquent in 2009 or 2010, before the garnishment started. (Tr. 37) The accounts when \ndelinquent at the time her daughter\u2019s father stopped providing child support.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 2017 SOR Response, she stated the debts in SOR 1.q ($60), \nSOR 1.r ($35), and SOR 1.s ($35) had been paid, but provided no documentation showing \npayment had been made. (SOR Response) In her response, she indicated the following \ndelinquent obligations would be paid by December 2017: SOR 1.w ($356), SOR 1.y \n($227), SOR 1.z ($194), and SOR 1.aa ($125). (SOR Response) No documentation was \nreceived showing payment had been made on these debts. These four medical debts \nappear in her payoff plan showing she intended to pay the debts in June 2018, July 2018, \nand August 2018. (Ex. J) \n \n                                                          \n4 The collection account in SOR 1.c was listed as \u201c$11,4377.\u201d Department Counsel moved to amend the \namount to $11,437. (Tr. 8) There being no objection, the amount was changed. \n\n \n5 \n \nIn May 2017, when Applicant responded to the SOR, she stated she was unfamiliar \nwith the $479 past-due account (SOR 1.e). (Tr. 37) She had a $528 credit card account \n(SOR 1.g) charged off. The credit card was used to purchase school clothes for her \ndaughter in 2014. (Tr. 39) Her February 2018 credit report indicates a balance of $297 \nshowing she has made some payments on the debt. (Ex. 4) She had a $507 collection \naccount (SOR 1.h) for a home improvement store. (Tr. 40) It is part of a repayment plan \nshe intends to start. (Tr. 41) She plans on starting to pay her smaller debts and allow the \n\u201csnowball effect\u201d to help her address her delinquent accounts. (Tr. 41) \n \n \nApplicant owed approximately $2,200 on 12 delinquent medical debts: SOR 1.i \n($499), SOR 1.l ($379), SOR 1.n ($149), 1.o ($144), SOR 1.p ($60), SOR 1.q ($60), SOR \n1.r ($35), SOR 1.s ($1), SOR 1.w ($356), SOR 1.y ($277), SOR 1.z ($194), and SOR \n1.aa ($125). She had health insurance and assumed her insurance company would have \npaid these medical debts for surgery received. (Tr. 42) She asserted that in April 2017, \nshe made a repayment plan with one of the creditors and made a payment on the plan. \n(Tr. 41) She has not made any additional payments. She was unfamiliar with these \nmedical debts. She was the victim of identity theft and wanted to make sure the debts \nwere valid. (Tr. 44) She believes she has paid some of these medical debts. (Tr. 46) \n \n \nApplicant learned that her identity had been stolen when she attempted to file her \ntaxes one year and was told her tax return had already been filed. (Tr. 51) It took nine \nmonths to resolve the problem. She has been on a fraud alert with one of the major credit \nreporting agencies. (Tr. 52) When credit inquiries are made, she receives notification of \nthe inquiry. She provided no additional information has to how the identity theft has \naffected her finances. In her SOR Response she denied two of the SOR debts and \nadmitted, sometimes with explanation, the other 26 SOR delinquent obligations.  \n \nApplicant owed a $497 collection balance on a department store account (SOR \n1.j). (Tr. 41) She owed $405 on another credit card collection account (SOR 1.k) in \ncollection. She owed $697 on a telephone company collection account (SOR 1.u) and \n$647 on an electrical bill collection debt (SOR 1.v). (Tr. 47) She has included these four \ndebts in her repayment plan. (Tr. 42) She disputes a debt with the bottled water company \n(SOR 1.m, $167). (Tr. 43) In December 2017, she asserts the cable television collection \naccount (SOR 1.t, $1,222) was paid. (Tr. 47) She disputes a $342 insurance collection \ndebt (SOR 1.x, $342) since she never had insurance with the company. (Tr. 48)  \n \nAt some period of time not set forth in the record, Applicant sought the services of \na credit correction company who sent letters on her behalf disputing each of the SOR \ndebts. (Tr. 49) She employed the credit correction company to assist her in having \ndelinquent accounts removed from her credit report. She had 34 negative accounts \nremoved5 from her credit report. (Ex. F) There is no indication she made any payment on \nthe negative accounts. Her credit score was 602 indicating her credit was \u201cfair.\u201d (Ex. F) \n                                                          \n5 The removal of debts supposedly includes the debt in SOR 1.c ($11,436). The credit collection company\u2019s \ninformation indicates this debt was to be removed in August 2017 and October 2017. However, the debt \nstill appears on her February 2018 credit report and appears as a debt to be paid in her payoff plan. (Ex. F, \nEx. J, and Ex. 4) \n\n \n6 \nNor did she indicate which, if any, of the removed accounts were listed as SOR delinquent \nobligations. The document from the credit collection company indicates that should she,  \n \nfail to pay a credit or charge card bill, bounce a check, or miss payments on \nother credit related bills, the issuer may continue in house collection efforts \nor send you overdue bill to a third pay collection agency, a company that \nwill then attempt to obtain payment from you. (Ex. F) \n \nApplicant now monitors her finances to the penny. (Tr. 53) She has approximately \n$128,000 in her 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 54) Her husband has approximately $20,000 \nin his 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 65) She pays $1,100 monthly on her mortgage for the \nhouse she has lived in since 2003. (Tr. 55) She is current on her monthly car payment \n($500) and truck payment ($700). (Tr. 56) Both vehicle were purchased used. \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband believes they are getting back on track and believes the future \nis \u201ca whole lot brighter.\u201d (Tr. 63) They had a plan to address their debts which was \ninterrupted by the garnishment. (Tr. 63) They have read books on financial planning, \ntalked with their pastor, and listened to the Dave Ramsey radio show about implementing \nthe financial planning techniques set forth in the Financial Peace University. (Tr. 63) They \nnow take time to evaluate their situation before making a financial decision. (Tr. 64) In \nAugust 2017, her mother died and she paid expenses from her death. (Ex. G) \n \nApplicant testified at her hearing that her approach to her finances has changed, \nas follows: \n \nWe have been, you know, kind of lackadaisical in our approach to paying \noff previous debts, but now that we are fully aware that it affects my job, that \nwe have been aggressively trying to get these [her delinquent debts] to zero. \n(Tr. 73)  \n \nApplicant made five payments, which totaled approximately $6,500, for her \ndaughter\u2019s tuition. (Ex. H) Three of the payments, which totaled $3,166, occurred after \nthe hearing. In addition to paying her daughter\u2019s tuition, she provided documentation that \nshe made five payments to creditors that totaled $180. (Ex. I) In May and June 2018, she \nmade two payments of $25.37 each to the creditor of the SOR 1.h debt ($507). (Ex. I) In \nMay 2018, she made a $19.82 payment to a creditor. In May and June 2018, she made \ntwo payments of $55 each to a creditor, but failed to indicate to which SOR debt it applied. \n(Ex. I) She stopped making payments to these three creditors when she found out her \ndaughter\u2019s tuition would not be fully funded. (Ex. G) \n \nCharacter Statements \n \n \nA co-worker, who has known Applicant for five years and has been Applicant\u2019s \ndirect manager for the past three years, states Applicant is dedicated, trustworthy, and \ndetail-oriented, and takes great pride in her work. (Ex. A) Applicant is willing to put forth \nextra effort or long hours if required by the job. A co-worker, who has known Applicant for \n\n \n7 \nmore than ten years, states Applicant is very diligent. (Ex. B) A manager, who has known \nApplicant for more than five years, states Applicant continuously demonstrates high \nethical character in executing her responsibilities. (Ex. C) A friend, who has known \nApplicant for more than 21 years, states Applicant is dependable, professional, always \nwilling to go the extra mile to accomplish goals, morally upstanding, trustworthy, has an \nexcellent work ethic, and who donates her time to the youth department at her church. \n(Ex. D) \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \n\n \n8 \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal acts or other \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. Applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage her finances to meet her financial obligations. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Security concerns are established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) because Applicant had delinquent student loans of approximately $43,000, \nwhich have now been paid by an involuntary garnishment action. Additionally, Applicant \nhad 25 delinquent accounts, which totaled in excess of $40,000. The burden shifted to \nApplicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security \nconcerns. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \n\n \n9 \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant presented some mitigating information. She experienced financial \ndifficulties when, as a single mother raising her daughter, she did not receive financial \nassistance from her daughter\u2019s father. Her mother died in August 2017, and she had to \npay some of the expenses related to her mother\u2019s death. These are factors beyond her \ncontrol. The involuntary garnishment for her student loans prevented her from addressing \nher other financial obligations. However, the garnishment ended in December 2017, she \npresented documentation of only five payments, which totaled $3,346. Three payments \nof $3,166 were made on her daughter\u2019s tuition and $180 in five payments went to SOR \ndebts. She stopped making payments to these creditors when she found out her \ndaughter\u2019s tuition would not be fully funded. \n\n \n10 \nApplicant has worked for her employer for more than 17 years and her duty \nperformance has been outstanding. Her annual salary is approximately $124,000 and her \nhusband\u2019s annual salary is approximately $45,000. With a household income of \n$169,000, she has documented payment of only $180 on the SOR delinquent obligations.  \nShe has presented a debt payoff plan, but has failed to document payment in accord with \nthat plan. Intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct 23, 2013) She has not acted responsibly to address her delinquent SOR \ndebts after the involuntary garnishment ended in December 2017. \n \nApplicant admitted she and her husband had been lackadaisical in their approach \nto paying off her debts, but now were fully aware that her job is affected by her delinquent \nobligations. She asserts she now monitors her finances to the penny, has approximately \n$128,000 in her 401(k) retirement plan, and her husband has approximately $20,000 in \nhis 401(k) retirement plan. They are current on their mortgaged and vehicle payments. \nShe asserts she has been aggressively trying to get these her delinquent debts to zero, \nbut documented payments of less than $200 fails to support this assertion.  \n \nSome of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies have been removed from her credit report. The \ndebts were not removed because they were paid. The Appeal Board has observed \u201cthat \n[the fact] some debts have dropped off [an individual\u2019s] credit report is not meaningful \nevidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing \nISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). Additionally, Applicant failed to \ndocument that any of the removed debts correlated to the delinquent SOR obligations. \nShe admitted to incurring all but two of the SOR debts, and she listed 24 of the SOR debts \nto be paid in the future under her payoff plan. \n \nThe mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(a) do not apply because the debts are numerous \nand remain unpaid. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply even though there are some factors that \nwere beyond her control such as her mother death in 2017, her failure to receive child \nsupport, the involuntary bankruptcy, and her assertion of identity theft.6 The small amount \nof documented payments shows she has not acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nApplicant has read books on financial planning, talked with her pastor, and listened \nto financial planning radio shows. However, for AG \u00b6 20(c) to apply there must not only \nbe financial counseling, but clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol, which has not been documented.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 2017 SOR Response, she indicated she had established certain \nrepayment plans. At the time of hearing, nine months later, no payments had been made \nor evidence provided that repayment plans existed. Following the hearing, she presented \nevidence of a debt payoff plan but no track record of payments in accord with that plan \nfrom which I could reasonably conclude that she can be counted on to make timely \n                                                          \n6 Applicant asserts she learned of identity theft when she filed her income tax returns. However, she did \nnot show how that identity theft impacted on the delinquent SOR obligations. The majority of those \nobligations she admitted to in her SOR response and are part of her payoff plan. \n\n \n11 \npayments to resolve her substantial delinquencies. Involuntary garnishment resolved her \nstudent loans in SOR 1.a, but it is not considered a good-faith effort under AG \u00b6 20(d), \nwhich does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant has denied only two \nof the debts, which totaled approximately $800 of the $40,000 of delinquent debt. She \nhas not provided a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which \nis the cause of the problem. Nor has she provided documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \nAn Applicant is not required to be debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all \ndebts immediately or simultaneously, but she is required to act responsibly given her \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan to address her delinquent obligations, \naccompanied by evidence of a serious intent to effectuate the plan. This has not been \ndone. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. An administrative judge must evaluate \nan Applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in the whole-person analysis. In her favor, her duty performance has been \noutstanding. A number supervisors, co-workers, and friends presented favorable \ncomments on Applicant\u2019s work performance and character. Additionally, she has received \na prestigious award in recognition of her accomplishments in science, technology, \nengineering and the mathematics community. The outstanding achievement award \nrecognized her as a technology raising star. \n \n\n \n12 \nThe financial evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more \nsubstantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant listed a \nsingle medical delinquent account on her e-QIP. There is no showing she has been in \ncontact with her creditors. She has a household income of $169,000, been gainfully \nemployed for more than 17 years with the same employer, but has documented payment \nof less than $200 on her delinquent obligations since the involuntary garnishment ended \nin December 2017. She has not shown that she acted responsibly to address her \ndelinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s failure to make greater progress resolving her SOR debts \nshows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and raises unmitigated questions \nabout her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \n\u00b6 18. The issue is not simply whether all Applicant\u2019s debts are paid\u2014it is whether her \nfinancial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. See \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(b). \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, the unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith a track record of behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Security Concern:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.s:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:   \n  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.u through 1.s:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n  \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Bakaj, Esquire \n \n08/28/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n \n                                        Statement of the Case \n \nOn April 30, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. On May 21, 2018, \nApplicant timely submitted a response in which he admitted all allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). I was assigned the case on October 12, 2018. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on December 12, 2018, setting the hearing for January 17, 2019. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered eight documents, accepted without objection as exhibits \n(Exs.) 1-8. Applicant offered testimony, introduced one witness, and 23 documents, \nwhich were accepted without objection as Exs. A-W. He was given through January 25, \n2019, to submit additional documents. On that date, one additional reference was \naccepted without objection as Ex. X. Applicant was granted additional time to submit \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nadditional material through March 1, 2019. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January \n28, 2019.  With no additional material received by March 1, 2019, the record was \nclosed. Based on the exhibits, testimony, and record as a whole, I find Applicant \nmitigated all security concerns.   \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old systems engineer who has served in the same position \nfor the past 15 years. He has maintained a security clearance without incident since \n2006. He excels at work. (Ex. J) Applicant has completed high school and attended \nsome college. He is the divorced father of two grown children. The marriage was \ncontentious and Applicant filed for divorce in 1995 based on her flagrant infidelity. In his \nspare time, he has volunteered with an organization devoted to women\u2019s health issues. \n \n \nIn September 1983, when he was 18 years old, Applicant was stopped for \nspeeding as he enjoyed an end of summer meeting with a high school friend. Applicant \nhad been drinking alcohol and also had used Listerine to freshen his breath. He was \narrested after being administered a breathalyzer test (.01). He was charged with driving \nunder the influence (DUI). He was not convicted of DUI, but was given probation before \njudgment. Applicant completed prescribed classes, as ordered.  \n \nIn 1991, Applicant was charged with battery following a scuffle at a party where \nhis former wife felt he was flirting with other women. She sprayed Mace (pepper spray) \nin his face, he lunged, and knocked her over. As he tried to wash the substance from \nhis face, she called the police. The matter was put on the stet docket for a year, during \nwhich time no additional incidents occurred and the case was abandoned. Around this \ntime, he learned his former spouse was pregnant, and their relationship improved. (Tr. \n49) \n \nDespite getting married in 1993, their relationship had started to decline by \nAugust 1994 after Applicant discovered his wife was seeing other men. The clues to this \nface were not subtle. (Tr. 49-50) A heated argument was verbally waged, and Applicant \nwent to spend the night at his parents\u2019 vacant home. The next morning, police arrested \nhim and he was charged with one count of abuse (child under 18), two counts of \nassault, and two counts of battery. Applicant continues to maintain no physical \ninteraction occurred with either his now former spouse or a child. (Tr. 50-51) Indeed, he \nstressed that the children were away with his parents. On advice of counsel, and so as \nnot to protract either the process or the marriage, Applicant accepted a plea deal and \npled guilty to the battery charges. (see, e.g., Tr. 51, 83) He then attended anger \nmanagement class, was sentenced to four years suspended confinement, and \nseparated from his spouse. \n \nIn 1995, Applicant and his estranged spouse tried to reconcile for the benefit of \nthe children despite his spouse\u2019s continued infidelities. (Tr. 52) Their reunion did not \nhamper her evening activities outside of the home. In February 1996, the spouse came \nhome as Applicant was resting. The spouse went to her room and later emerged to call \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nthe police, claiming he had \u201csmashed [her] headboard and ruined some furniture.\u201d (Tr. \n53) She had a temporary protective order instituted, which forced Applicant to vacate \nthe home, and a domestic violence suit was brought against him. He appealed that \ndetermination and the matter was subsumed into the on-going divorce and custody \ncase. (Tr. 86) With her trying to harass him through legal process multiple times, \nApplicant hired a private investigator to \u201cvalidate the fact that this is her motivation - to \nreplace me, again . . . and move her boyfriend in. . . .\u201d (Tr. 55, 85-86) Among the \ninvestigator\u2019s findings were the spouse\u2019s misuse of credit cards, leaving their two \nchildren unsupervised, and other incidents she could blame on him. (Tr. 55; Ex. K, Q-T)  \n \nIn April 1996, Applicant and his estranged spouse had to talk about the children, \nbills, and the household. The spouse was unhappy taking on her share of \nresponsibilities and threatened to file a harassment charge against him. (Tr. 55) For six \nmonths, he was unable to visit the children after he was charged with three counts of \nviolating an ex parte protective order and one count of harassment. The harassment \ncharges were dismissed. (Tr. 56) Around this same time, the spouse went to court to \naddress the misuse of credit card and leaving a child unattended issues. (Tr. 56)  \n \n \nOne night in May 1996, under much marital stress, Applicant had a beer or two \nwith a friend. (Tr. 80-81) He later stopped at a diner for something to eat and had one \ndrink. (Tr. 80) When he left, he was pulled over by a policeman who claimed that there \nhad been a call reporting an intoxicated driver. No field sobriety test or breathalyzer was \nadministered, but he admitted to having had alcohol. (Tr. 80) He was arrested and \ncharged with DUI. As a result, he was ordered to one-year unsupervised probation. \nFrom this experience, he has learned to never take control of a vehicle after he has had \nany alcohol to drink, a rule he maintains today. (Tr. 58) Currently, Applicant only drinks \na \u201climited\u201d amount of beer at dinner or on a special occasion. (Tr. 81) He will use Uber if \nhe has had any alcohol. \n \n \nIn 1997, after Applicant and his wife divorced on his petition. Applicant was \nawarded custody of the two children. They were aged about four and six, respectively. \nOne weekend in June 2001, Applicant took the children to the home of a family friend \nfor a birthday party. (Tr. 59) Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and her most current boyfriend showed \nup at the event uninvited. (Tr. 59-60) Although it was not one of her weekends for child \nvisitation, she wanted to take the children to make up for times she had failed to adhere \nto the established weekend custody time schedule.  \n \nApplicant was put into a \u201cprecarious\u201d position by his ex-wife during a children\u2019s \nparty. (Tr. 60) Her boyfriend got involved and started arguing with Applicant to the point \nwhere he \u201cgot in [Applicant\u2019s] face and pushed [him] to the ground.\u201d (Tr. 60)  While \nApplicant was on the floor, his ex-wife and her boyfriend took off in a vehicle with the \nchildren. That Monday, Applicant received a summons stating he had struck his ex-\nwife\u2019s boyfriend, despite several witnesses later appearing in court testifying that it was \nApplicant who was struck. (Tr. 61) Despite their testimony, and despite the boyfriend \ntestifying the ex-wife had started the incident, the judge decided Applicant was guilty of \nsecond-degree assault. The ex-wife requested a restraining order from the court, but \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nher request was denied as there was no evidence any party was in harm. (Tr. 62) She \nthen decided to again request custody of the children. (Tr. 62-63) \n \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s daughter was about 13 or 14 and experiencing some \nbehavioral issues. Applicant was still acting as both father and mother for the child. The \ndaughter would complain to her mother that Applicant was too strict. Applicant\u2019s mother \nagain tried to get a restraining order against Applicant in attempt to gain custody of both \nthe children and take them with her to another state. Her two requests were denied by \nthe court and Applicant continued maintaining custody of the children, with his ex-wife \nonly permitted visitation. (Tr. 64-65)   \n \nIn around 2008, Applicant began dating a woman he met through his \nvolunteering. They enjoyed each other\u2019s company and, after about a year, they moved \nin together. At the time, the girlfriend had two daughters, aged 4 and 6. Applicant moved \nthe four to a better community with superior schools and a safer area. The four got \nalong well and \u201chad a great time.\u201d (Tr. 40)  \n \nIn May 2010, Applicant discovered that his teenage son was getting into the drug \nscene. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend and her daughters were living with Applicant at the time, \nand they were aware of the son\u2019s various forms of misbehavior, leading Applicant to \npronounce that smoking was not permitted in the home. (Tr. 65) The son complained to \nhis mother, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife. This led her to again pursue a temporary restraining \norder, this time alleging child abuse, against Applicant. Ultimately, a restraining order \nwas denied. (Tr. 66) This was Applicant\u2019s last conflict with his ex-wife. His children, now \nages 24 and 26, live separate lives apart from their mother. Although the son still has \nissues with drugs about which Applicant has struggled, the child\u2019s mother maintains little \ncontact with the man. (Tr. 66) \n \nIn June 2015, Applicant was leading a household comprised of his girlfriend, her \ntwo daughters, the eldest daughter\u2019s baby, and Applicant. He was acting as both parent \nand grandparent, managing the children\u2019s schedules, cooking meals, and providing \ncounsel. (Tr. 13) At this time, the younger of Applicant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s minor daughters was \ntrying to date a man in his 20s.  \n \nWhen Applicant discovered the man with his girlfriend\u2019s daughter in the home \none school night around 9:00 or 10:00 p.m., Applicant reminded the child of her curfew \nand asked the man to leave. The decision was made in tandem with the girl\u2019s mother. \n(Tr. 16) The girl got very upset and started a heated argument, yelling and screaming. \n(Tr. 16) The potential date demonstrated his \u201chot temper\u201d joined the girl in yelling and \nshoved Applicant. (Tr. 17, 68-69) He then lunged at Applicant as he tried to phone the \npolice. The girl\u2019s sister tried to stop the younger man and got between the two males, \ngetting accidently elbowed in the face in the process. Applicant tried to retreat to the \nbathroom to call the police, but the younger man pursued and got Applicant in a \nheadlock. (Tr. 17) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nA melee ensued. The mother entered the room and became upset after seeing \none daughter had received a bloody nose from being elbowed. (Tr. 22) The mother \nnever saw the scuffle. After statements were taken, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith second degree assault of the females. (Tr. 70) This was due in part to the mother\u2019s \nstatement that she thought Applicant had hit the girl and the younger daughter\u2019s \nstatement that he struck her mother. (Tr. 18-19, 70-71) In court, the girl recanted her \nstatement that Applicant had struck her mother in the skirmish and the man pled the 5th \nAmendment. (Tr. 70-71) Applicant was found not guilty of assault against the teen.  \n \nDespite the youngest daughter\u2019s recantation, Applicant was found guilty of \nassaulting his girlfriend. Applicant appealed the matter, discrepancies in the witnesses \ntestimonies were stressed, and the case was ultimately dropped. (Tr. 71, 91-92)  \n \nThus began an end of the romantic relationship between Applicant and his \ngirlfriend, but time has healed any wounds and all parties have moved on. (Tr. 94) \nToday, Applicant is close to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s daughters and grandchild. The former \ngirlfriend and the elder daughter now live in different states, but both wrote \nrecommendations for Applicant. (Exs. B-C) Applicant and the two daughters text, visit \nwhen in the same town, and otherwise maintain varying degrees of contact. Applicant \nhas provided nominal financial assistance to the younger women when needed, but \nnone of the women is financially dependent on him.  \n \nThe girlfriend\u2019s younger daughter has matured since 2015. She flew in to appear \nat the hearing and testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf at the hearing, noting that she loves \nand completely trusts him as a father figure and as a man, around whom she has never \nfelt unsafe or at risk. (Tr. 12-21, 26) The two speak by telephone about every other day. \n(Tr. 26) The daughters\u2019 natural father is appreciative of Applicant\u2019s help with the young \nwomen. (Tr. 72-73; Ex. G)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. The AG \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. In addition, an applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s series of multiple arrests and charges are sufficient to establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin 6 combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline may be mitigated by the following \napplicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \n \nApplicant abused alcohol and drove a vehicle twice, well over 20 years ago. \nSince that time, he has been mindful of his alcohol use, does not drink and drive, and \nhas become used to using Uber, if he needs it. Before, during, and after his contentious \nmarriage, Applicant was seemingly trapped in a situation where legal process was used \nby his ex-wife to gain some form of advantage over him, most often with regard to their \nchildren. Despite her using multiple restraining orders and various allegations as \nweapons, it was Applicant who almost invariably maintained physical custody over their \nchildren. It was also Applicant whose bond with those children has seemingly endured. \nIndeed, since the divorce and the children coming of age, she has apparently lost \ninterest in the family and moved on. Free of her and her machinations, Applicant\u2019s life \nhas been comparatively drama-free and crime-free, giving him time to concentrate on \nwork and on volunteering within his community.  \n \nOnly one subsequent incident of criminal conduct has occurred since Applicant\u2019s \nex-wife left the scene. In trying to enforce a curfew for his girlfriend\u2019s teenage daughter \nwhen a man came to call, Applicant found himself in the middle of a ruckus involving a \nhysterical teen, a surly \u201chot head\u201d suitor, a confused and dramatic mother, and the \nmother\u2019s elder daughter trying to calm tensions all around. Despite later statements to \nthe contrary, Applicant was ultimately found guilty of a second degree assault against \nthe mother, his now ex-girlfriend. Today, however that girlfriend and her two daughters \nspeak in favor of Applicant and recommend him for a security clearance. The hysterical \nteen is now a mature young lady who speaks highly of Applicant, who she now loves \nand respects as a father figure. Even the girl\u2019s natural father appreciates Applicant\u2019s \nefforts to help raise the girls. Despite the 2015 incident helping end his relationship with \nhis ex-girlfriend, there is no apparent rancor by any of the individuals, each enjoying \nvarying degrees of closeness and physical proximity with each other.  \n \nGiven where Applicant is today with regard to both his ex-wife, his ex-girlfriend, \nand their respective children, it is highly unlikely such family dramas will be repeated, \nparticularly given Applicant subsequent maturation and personal resolve. He has \nlearned anger management skills, excelled at work, and gained the genuine and \ncredibly expressed love and appreciation of a young lady he helped raise. He has \nmoved from the responsibilities of being a father figure to minors to being a grandfather \nfigure to their children. I find AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) apply. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Here, the SOR repeats in its entirety allegations raised under the \npreceding guideline, and also references one suit and multiple restraining orders issued \nagainst him by or at the request of his ex-wife. Such conduct could raise the following \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and many not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, considerations of: . . . (2) \nany disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations. . . ; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s persona, \nprofessional, or community standing.   \n \n \nThis guideline provides seven potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. Four \nare potentially applicable under these facts: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9 \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n AG \u00b6 17(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast \ndoubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \nAs a threshold issue, my findings under the preceding guideline are incorporated \nunder this guideline, thus substantially giving rise to AG \u00b6 17(c). In addition, the current \nguideline offers four allegations related to Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s use of legal process \nduring and after their marriage. Taken in isolation, each incident indicates that there \nmay be more than meets the eye. Taken as a pattern, however, the facts tend to \nsubstantiate Applicant\u2019s assertion that his ex-wife\u2019s attempt to harass or gain advantage \nover him was the motivating factor behind most of her claims and attempts to secure \nrestraining orders. I am also moved by the fact that he successfully maintained custody \nof their children throughout most of this period despite her multiple derogatory \nassertions.  \n \nMoreover, Applicant was candid in his testimony. His current recollections may \nnot match 100% with previously documented versions of facts. It is noted, however, that \nthe timeline at issue extends over a period in excess of 35 years, involves highly \npersonal incidents one may not choose to remember vividly, entails several similar \nallegations based on varying facts, and yet contains no extraordinary deviations. He has \ncompleted anger management coursework and had no other incidents in over four \nyears. He has no contact with his ex-wife and cordial, albeit limited, contract with his ex-\ngirlfriend, while maintaining positive relationships with his children and his ex-girlfriend\u2019s \nchildren. With the exception of Applicant\u2019s ex-wife, he has the support of all individuals \ninvolved, including his ex-girlfriend\u2019s former husband. Applicant has moved on with his \nlife and is past the child rearing stage. It is highly unlikely he will again be caught in \nsuch domestic dramas again. I find Applicant raised mitigating concerns AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d), \n(e), and (g). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole-person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder the two applicable guidelines in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nApplicant\u2019s highly credible testimony, his education, family dynamics. divorce, \nbehavioral changes, maturation, and current lifestyle. \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old systems engineer who has served in the same position \nfor the past 15 years and maintained a security clearance without incident for 13 years. \nSuccessful at work, he has a high school diploma and completed some college courses. \nHe is the divorced father of two grown children, and helped raised to girls who were the \ndaughters of a long-term girlfriend.   \n \n \nBetween 1983 and 2015, Applicant was cited for multiple criminal and personal \nconduct issues. With the exception of two DUI charges, a matter addressed when he \nchanged his drinking and driving patterns in 1996, the issues are related to either his \nex-wife or his relationship with a subsequent girlfriend and her two daughters. Given the \nnumber and timing of the ex-wife\u2019s charges and complaints, the ultimate disposition in \nthose matters, and her apparent abandonment of the children since they reached their \nmajority, it appears that issues regarding personal conduct are more appropriately \npinned on her.  \n \nAs for the 2015 family brouhaha, Applicant was clearly acting in a fatherly \ncapacity and also backing up his girlfriend when he tried to stop her teenage daughter \nfrom going out with a man in his 20s. A fight ensued, with each party entering at \ndifferent points, with only Applicant, the teen who wanted to go on the date, and the \nsuitor being there throughout. The teen agrees Applicant was the victim, not the \naggressor in the incident. Regardless, any wounds have healed, and Applicant \npresently gets on well with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s two daughters. The incidents in this case \nare unique and involve equally unique family dynamics. As previously noted, Applicant \nis no longer in the child-rearing stage of his life. The roots of his problems in the two \nrelationships at issue have either moved on, gone away, or been healed. In light of all \nthis, and given the passage of over four years without any further incidents, I find \nApplicant mitigated criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Sykstus, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \nWhile Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose from circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol, he failed to act reasonably under the circumstances and did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by his finances. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 25, 2016. \nOn April 13, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations). The \nDOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, \n2006.  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on May 9, 2017, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \n02/08/2019\n\n2 \n \nJune 22, 2017, and the case was originally scheduled for hearing with another \nadministrative judge on March 6, 2018. The hearing was subsequently canceled and the \ncase was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 20, 2018, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant, through counsel, that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 5, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through WW, which were admitted without \nobjection, and called five witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 13, 2018.  \n  \nThe SOR was issued under the AG implemented on September 1, 2006. The DOD \nimplemented the amended AG on June 8, 2017, while this decision was pending. This \ndecision is based on the amended AG effective June 8, 2017.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, 46, is a systems engineer currently employed by a defense contractor \nsince January 2014. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 1994 until he \nretired in March 2014. His service included three combat tours, and he received \nnumerous metals and commendations, including a Bronze Star for meritorious service. \nHe and his current wife married in 2001. They have four adult children and twins in high \nschool. Applicant was first granted a security clearance in 1994. (GX 1; AX A; AX II \nthrough WW; Tr. 14.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges four debts totaling $36,884 and a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy discharged in 2006. Applicant admits each of these allegations. The \ndelinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s February 2017 and April 2016 credit bureau \nreports (CBR) and discussed during his September 2016 personal subject interview (PSI). \n(GX 5; GX 4; GX 2.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nPrior to their marriage and 2001, both Applicant and his wife individually filed \nChapter 13 bankruptcy. (Tr. 59.) The bankruptcies were discharged in 2006. (GX 3.) \nApplicant and his wife struggled financially early in their marriage, in part because they \nwere both active duty and not earning significant salaries, and because of the size of their \nhousehold. (Tr. 20.) However, Applicant was promoted and their finances had otherwise \nstabilized, so Applicant purchased a boat for $28,694 in April 2008. (GX 4; GX 5; Tr. 35; \nTr. 65.) \n \n \nBoth Applicant and his wife testified that Applicant\u2019s wife is responsible for \nmanaging the household finances. (Tr. 45; Tr. 60.) Applicant attributes his financial \ndifficulties to the combined impact of several events in 2011. Applicant\u2019s wife was eligible \nto retire from the military in 2011. They reviewed their finances and determined that if \nApplicant deployed, he would receive greater pay and his wife could retire. She retired in \nMay 2011. Applicant\u2019s wife was approved for 80% disability compensation upon \nretirement, but did not start receiving payments until approximately May 2012. Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s reduced income and delayed disability compensation created greater financial \nstrains on the household. (Tr. 59-60.) \n\n3 \n \nAdditionally, the vehicle Applicant\u2019s wife was driving during this time had major \nengine trouble that required repairs that cost $7,000 to $9,000. (Tr. 52; Tr. 27.) Despite \nthe fact that Applicant had purchased an extended warranty for the vehicle, the dealership \nwould not honor the warranty. The vehicle underwent several repair attempts, but never \nran properly, and eventually became inoperable. At some point, Applicant stopped \nmaking payments, and the vehicle was ultimately repossessed. (Tr. 26-28.) The $7,241 \nbalance (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was charged-off in March 2012. (GX 4.) \n \nIn September 2011, Applicant\u2019s son was in an accident that resulted in third-degree \nburns and had to be airlifted to a hospital in another city for medical treatment. Applicant \nwas deployed and his wife had to travel several hours from their home to see their son in \nthe hospital. This resulted in travel-related and childcare costs as well as medical bills. \n(Tr. 50; GX 2.) \n \nDue to the increased financial stressors, Applicant fell behind on his monthly \nobligations, including his monthly boat payments of approximately $500. Applicant \nattempted to negotiate with the creditor, but the creditor demanded a full lump-sum \npayment. Applicant\u2019s last payment on the boat was in September 2011, and the boat was \nlater voluntarily repossessed. (Tr. 36-37; GX 4.) Applicant believes the boat was sold at \nauction. The creditor charged-off the $28,694 original loan amount (SOR \u00b6 1.c) in June \n2014. (GX 4.) Applicant\u2019s wife testified that the creditor sent Applicant letters attempting \nto collect the debt, but because they did not have the money to pay the debt, she did not \nrespond. (Tr. 70.) She further stated that between 2012 and 2016 she \u201cdid not make any \neffort to pay the debts . . . we did start making more money in 2014, but honestly it had \nbeen so long that I didn\u2019t make any effort to pay those.\u201d (Tr. 74.) \n \nApplicant discussed his delinquent accounts with the investigator during his PSI in \nSeptember 2016. At that time, Applicant stated that he did not know the status of the \n$7,241 repossessed-vehicle debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) or the $28,694 repossessed-boat debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) and had not had any contact with the creditors. The investigator confronted \nApplicant with several other delinquent accounts including the $605 credit-card debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) and the $344 cellular telephone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant was unaware of \nthese debts but stated that he would consult his wife, and if the debts were valid, he would \nattempt to resolve them within the next 30 days. (GX 2.) In his Answer, Applicant stated \nthat, \u201cnow that we are financially able and I am aware of the repercussions, I intend to \npay these debts.\u201d   \n \nApplicant testified that the first time he recalls being aware of his delinquent debts \nwas in 2016 when reviewing his CBR with the mortgage broker. (Tr. 51-52.) He further \ntestified that the mortgage broker advised Applicant not to contact the creditors of or to \nmake payments on the outstanding $7,241 repossessed-vehicle debt or the $28,694 \nrepossessed-boat debt. Applicant explained that the mortgage broker stated that the \ndebts were old, but any activity on the accounts could reactivate them, which could result \nin a negative impact on Applicant\u2019s credit and ability to qualify for a favorable interest rate. \n(Tr. 52-53.) Applicant also stated that the mortgage broker told him that paying the \ndelinquent accounts would result in Applicant\u2019s not being \u201cable  to  purchase  the  home \n\n4 \n \nbecause  our  credit  rating  would drop.\u201d (Tr. 30-31.) Applicant opted not to contact the \ncreditors. (Tr. 37.)  \n \nApplicant received an IRS 1099 C Forgiveness of Debt Form in 2017, and paid the \nrequired tax. (Tr. 45.) Neither Applicant nor his wife specifically recognize the $605 credit-\ncard debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr. 39; Tr. 69.) The debt was charged off in September \n2010. The $344 delinquent cellular telephone account (SOR \u00b6 1.e) was last paid in \nSeptember 2009 and transferred to collection in November 2011. (GX 5.) In December \n2017 or January 2018, when the initial hearing was pending, Applicant was concerned \nabout any remaining delinquent accounts. He contacted the creditors of these two \naccounts and paid them by telephone. (Tr. 39.) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e have been \nresolved. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s four character witnesses, all of whom hold security clearances and \nknow Applicant professionally and personally, have served with or worked with Applicant. \nThe witnesses collectively testified to the strength of Applicant\u2019s character, stating that \nApplicant had an outstanding reputation of integrity, honesty, trustworthiness, and \ndedication. (Tr. 75-93.) Applicant\u2019s 1997 to 2013 military evaluation reports are positive, \nand his service school academic evaluations show that he met or exceeded course \nstandards. (AX I through FF.) He received the following awards for his military service: \nArmy Achievement medal 1996, 1999, 2000; Armed Forces Expeditionary medal 1996; \nGood Conduct medal 1997, 2003, 2005; Army Commendation medal 2003, 2004, 2008, \n2010; Bronze Star medal 2008; and Meritorious Service medal 2013. Applicant\u2019s 2014 to \n2017 employee performance reviews show that Applicant met or exceeded performance \nexpectations and that Applicant was a valuable team member and a key asset to the \nprograms on which he has worked. (AX E through AX H.) \n  \nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $4,400, and he and his wife both receive \nmilitary retirement and disability compensation payments. Their net monthly household \nincome is approximately $11,100. (Tr. 41-43.) Applicant and his wife both testified that \nthey are currently in a good financial position. (Tr. 41; Tr. 67.) Applicant purchased a \nhouse in July 2016 with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage-loan of 3.75%.1 (Tr. 31.) His \nmonthly loan payment as of December 2016 was $2,108. (GX 5.) Applicant did not submit \na written budget, nor is there any reference to maintaining a budget in Applicant\u2019s or his \nwife\u2019s testimony. Applicant contributes $2,000 a month to his 401(k) and pays $6,000 \nannually for additional medical insurance. Applicant testified that he does not have any \nother delinquent accounts. (Tr. 48.) There is no other record evidence regarding \nApplicant\u2019s financial obligations. Neither of the parties submitted a current credit bureau \nreport. Applicant has not taken any action to dispute his debts with credit reporting \nagencies. (Tr, 45-46.) Applicant does not have a plan to resolve his remaining delinquent \ndebt. \n \n \n \n                                            \n1 The national average annual mortgage-loan interest rate for 2016 was 3.65% with .05 points, with the July 2016 \naverage of 3.44% with .05 points.  www.freddiemac.com, January 30, 2019. \n\n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in 2011 due to several events that were \nlargely beyond his control. Specifically, Applicant\u2019s son was severely injured in an \naccident, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s income decreased, and Applicant\u2019s vehicle required costly \nrepairs. The financial strain caused by these events resulted in Applicant\u2019s inability to \nmaintain his financial obligations. However, Applicant has not acted reasonably in \nresolving his debts. Applicant has been aware of his delinquent accounts since 2016. On \nthe advice of his mortgage broker, Applicant took no action to satisfy his delinquent \naccounts because he was concerned he would not qualify for a mortgage loan. Applicant \nsecured a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan in 2016, but did not subsequently take any \nsteps to resolve his delinquent accounts. Applicant paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e, totaling \n$949 in December 2017 or January 2018 because he was concerned about the impact \nof delinquent accounts on his security clearance. The $7,241 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nwas resolved by the creditor\u2019s forgiveness of the debt, not by any affirmative action taken \nby Applicant. The $28,694 charged-off debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d remains unresolved and \nApplicant does not have a plan to pay it. \n \n \nThe appeal board has regularly held that \u201capplicants who only begin to address \ntheir security-significant conduct when their personal interests are at stake may be lacking \nin judgment and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, \n2017.)  \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant does not have any recent delinquent accounts, his failure to \nresolve his delinquent debt casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Additionally, Applicant acted in his own personal interests in securing a \nmortgage ahead of his legal obligation to satisfy his debts. His eleventh-hour payment of \ntwo SOR debts and the creditor\u2019s forgiveness of a third does not constitute a good-faith \neffort to resolve his debts. \u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). There is no evidence that Applicant has \nparticipated in financial counseling, and he does not have a plan to resolve his remaining \ndelinquent account. None of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s 2001 Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy does not create any current security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\n\n8 \n \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. Army for more than 20 years, including \nthree combat deployments, during which time he received multiple accolades for his \nservice. He has held a security clearance for more than 30 years. He is considered to be \ntrustworthy and is respected by his colleagues and friends. However, while he has not \nincurred any significant recent delinquent debt, the unresolved delinquent SOR debt \nremains a concern.  \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b \u2013 1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

Applicant engaged in a form \nof prostitution for about 12 months from 2016 to 2017 while holding a security clearance. \nHer claim that her behavior did not constitute prostitution is not persuasive. Sexual \nbehavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nAccess to classified information is denied.        \n  \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 9, 2013, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On April 16, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017.

(HE \n3) On August 22, 2018, the DOD CAF issued a replacement SOR setting forth security \nconcerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations), J (criminal conduct), D (sexual \nbehavior), and E (personal conduct). (HE 4)    \n \nOn September 1, 2018, Applicant responded to the replacement SOR. (HE 5) On \nJanuary 10, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On January 25, 2019, the \ncase was assigned to me. On April 12, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for July 1, 2019.

(Tr. 52) After \nshe learned of her delinquent debts, she reduced her expenses, especially her rent. (Tr. \n53) She cashed in her 401(k) account to pay her debts.

(Tr. 16, 37, 55) The status and disposition of the debts alleged \non the SOR are as follows:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a charged-off debt for $1,438. On June 7, 2018, Applicant paid \nthe creditor $1,000, and the debt was settled. (AE B; AE SR S) However, on September \n1, 2018, Applicant emailed that her credit report had not been updated to reflect resolution \nof this debt. (SOR response) I have credited her with resolving this debt.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, and 1.l allege telecommunications debts placed for collection for \n$783, $173, and $783. On May 16, 2018, Applicant paid the SOR \u00b6 1.b creditor $783. \n(AE C at 1; AE SR D) On May 14, 2018, Applicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h.

On May 18, 2018, the creditor wrote \nApplicant\u2019s debt was paid in full as of January 13, 2016. (AE C at 23-24)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges an account placed for collection for $588. On May 24, 2018, the \ncreditor wrote that the debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE C at 13) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q allege six delinquent medical debts for $572, \n$360, $92, $1,572, $165, and $165. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q do not allege \nspecific creditors seeking payment of the medical debts. On May 14, 2018, Applicant paid \na medical collection debt of unspecified amount. (AE SR O; AE C at 12) On May 15, 2018, \nApplicant paid the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.j $1,572. (AE C at 7) The creditor provided an \nundated letter stating the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.q were paid by insurance. (AE SR \nP; AE SR H; AE C at 25) On May 15, 2018, Applicant received an email indicating her 12 \nmedical debts for $1,589, $595, $1,633, $91, $100, $3,145, $339, $83, $190, $190, $85, \nand $24, were being paid in full. (AE C at 29-43) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a debt placed for collection for $350.

On May 15, 2018, a student loan creditor wrote a defaulted student loan of \nunspecified amount was paid in full in August 2012. (AE C at 3) On June 7, 2018, \nApplicant paid a student loan for $2,505. (AE C at 6) On July 3, 2018, a student loan \ncreditor wrote that five student loans of $5,500, $3,387, $2,750, $208, and $758 were \npaid in full. (AE C at 15-22) On January 7, 2019, three student loans for $3,353, $7,326, \nand $5,500 were paid in full.

In ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances \nin which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApril 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). I limited my consideration of \nApplicant\u2019s admission that she did not declare income from her customers in violation of \nthe Internal Revenue Code to the five purposes listed above.  \n \nCriminal Conduct, Sexual Behavior, and Personal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 3.a, and 4.a allege that Applicant was cited in March 2017 for \nprostitution and operating a business without a city license. SOR \u00b6 4.b alleges and \nApplicant admitted that she failed to timely report this citation to her security officer. (SOR \nresponse) Applicant did not report her arrest because her attorney told her not to do so \nbecause \u201cit would implicate [her] in a crime.\u201d (Tr. 76) \n \nIn March 2017, the police arrested Applicant at her residence. (Tr. 71) Applicant \nsaid she was not charged with operating a business without a license, and the prostitution \ncharge was dismissed because of lack of evidence that she engaged in prostitution. (Tr. \n75; SOR response, Order Dismissing Charge) After her arrest, she stopped seeking \ncustomers on a dating website. (Tr. 78, 81) After her Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), she reported the arrest to her security officer. (Tr. \n76-77) Applicant\u2019s counsel indicated the prostitution charge was a municipal violation and \nnot a violation of state law. (Tr. 16-17) In Applicant\u2019s state of residence, prostitution is a \nclass B misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $500. \nUnder the statute in Applicant\u2019s state, \u00a7 567.020, \u201cA person commits the offense of \nprostitution if he or she engages in or offers or agrees to engage in sexual conduct with \nanother person in return for something of value to be received by any person.\u201d \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \n \nApplicant believed her husband called the police and alleged she was engaged in \nprostitution. (Tr. 80; SR) Applicant criticized the credibility of a police officer involved in \nthe investigation of her prostitution charge. (Tr. 17-19) Her counsel cited a 2015 Eighth \nCircuit decision that named the police officer as having omitted information from an \naffidavit used to obtain a search warrant. (AE D) The magistrate noted information was \nomitted; however, the magistrate concluded that \u201cthe officer did not act intentionally or \nrecklessly to mislead the issuing judge.\u201d (AE D at 2) The district court judge agreed with \nthe magistrate. (AE D at 2-3) The Eighth Circuit found the omissions were negligent but \notherwise agreed the omissions were not made with deliberate falsity or reckless \ndisregard, and declined to suppress the product of the search. (AE D at 4, 6) Applicant \nalso provided a copy of a 2014 deposition of the same police officer relating to an alleged \nstalking incident the police officer investigated in 2012. (AE D) Applicant asserted the \npolice officer admitted in the deposition that he made a false statement in his investigation \nof the stalking allegation. (Tr. 17-20) Applicant and her former husband were not involved \nin the alleged stalking incident. (AE D)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s concerns about the officer\u2019s credibility have low relevance because \nApplicant did not contest most of the material facts in the police report. The only \ninformation Applicant challenged were the allegations, as summarized by the police \nofficer, of the two witnesses who said Applicant provided sex to them in exchange for \ntheir payments of the amounts specified on Applicant\u2019s Internet advertisement. (SOR \nReport) Written statements from the two witnesses were not included in the file. The two \nwitnesses were soldiers at a nearby military base, and Applicant\u2019s counsel said he was \nunable to locate them. Applicant\u2019s admissions at her hearing, and the advertisement and \npictures from the website are sufficient to establish the allegation of prostitution under the \nsubstantial evidence standard.     \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b, 3.c, 3.d, and 4.a allege Applicant engaged in sex with strangers that \nshe met on websites, including a dating website with a history of being involved with \nprostitution. Her website posting indicated she charged $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for \n60 minutes. At least one man that she met online paid her $80 following sex. \n \nFor about one year from 2016 to 2017, Applicant\u2019s semi-nude photographs and \ncontact information were placed on a dating or escort website. (Tr. 60-63, 68-70; GE 5) \nHer time was available for $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for 60 minutes. (Tr. 61-63) She \noffered conversation, warmth, massage, dance, and a special event to her customers. \n(Tr. 61-62, 74) In April 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a press release \nindicating the website Applicant was using to solicit customers was seized, as it was \u201cthe \ndominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers frequently \nadvertised children and adults alike.\u201d (Tr. 77; GE 9) \n \nOn March 11, 2017, the police stopped a vehicle that had just left Applicant\u2019s \nresidence. (GE 4) The driver was a soldier at a nearby military installation. The driver said \nhe had just paid Applicant $80 for sex. He said he also paid her $150 for sex on March 8, \n2017. (OPM ROI at 17) The police went to Applicant\u2019s residence and asked for the money \nthe witness paid her, and she provided four $20 bills. Id. Applicant told the police that she \nwas not engaging in prostitution. The police interviewed another witness who was a \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nsoldier at a nearby military installation, and he said he paid for sex about four times at \nApplicant\u2019s residence. Id. (police report) Applicant\u2019s lawyer said he was unable to locate \nthe two witnesses cited in the police report to challenge their credibility. (Tr. 45-46) When \nApplicant was questioned by the police, she \u201cwas concerned about the charge of \nprostitution as it would affect her security clearance.\u201d (GE 4)  \n \nApplicant had difficulty estimating how many people paid her for her time; however, \nshe estimated \u201cat least see[ing] 40 or more.\u201d (Tr. 64-66) She estimated that she had sex \nwith about 20 men. (Tr. 66-67) She was vague about how many of them paid after having \nsex with her. (Tr. 67-68) Some of the customers may have asked her for drugs; however, \nshe always refused to give them drugs. (Tr. 88) Applicant did not have anyone to protect \nher if the date with her customers became violent. (Tr. 87)  \n \nApplicant consistently denied that she engaged in prostitution. (Tr. 43, 47-48) She \ndenied that there was a direct relationship between the payment of funds and the sexual \nactivity. (Tr. 82; SR; GE 2) The purpose of the semi-nudity on her webpage was to \nencourage men to call her to go out with her. (Tr. 70) After the first date, some men \ncontinued their relationships with her and continued to pay her, and some did not pay her. \n(Tr. 71, 82) As for whether she was soliciting prostitution, Applicant explained, in an \nadvertisement a girl holding a soda may be wearing a bikini, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s \na prostitute.\u201d (Tr. 93) Applicant held a security clearance in the 2016 to 2017 time period \nwhen her webpage advertised her time to customers. (Tr. 75) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was vindictive towards her because of her conduct. Her \nhusband placed her pictures on a bad website to damage her reputation. (Tr. 38-42, 61; \nSOR response; GE 5) In 2016, he called her a prostitute at a basketball game their \nchildren were attending. (Tr. 39-40) He threatened to seek her conviction and sentencing \nto jail for prostitution. (Tr. 39) He sought an order barring her from seeing her children; \nhowever, the judge denied his motion, and he had to pay her attorney fees. (Tr. 40) Her \nhusband encouraged the police to investigate Applicant for engaging in prostitution. (Tr. \n41) \n \nApplicant conceded that she \u201cpresented [herself] in the wrong manner as far as \nthat [she] may have been doing an illegal action.\u201d (Tr. 80) At the time Applicant was \nutilizing the webpage to solicit customers, she had full-time employment and earned \n$53,500 annually. (Tr. 84) In 2016, she made a little more than $5,000 from the website. \n(Tr. 85) She did not include the income from the customers on her federal tax return for \ntax year 2016. (Tr. 85-86)     \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nIn 2018, Applicant received two promotions and a certificate of appreciation from \nher employer. (Tr. 50) She served in Afghanistan in 2014, and she was serving in \nAfghanistan at the time of her hearing. (Tr. 48)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s program manager has known her since 2000. (Tr. 28-29) He described \nher as an excellent employee who is conscientious, reliable, and responsible. (Tr. 30-31) \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nShe did not commit any security or rule violations. (Tr. 36) He supported her for positions \nof greater responsibility and a security clearance. (Tr. 32-33)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c).  \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-\n01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \nApplicant had an expensive divorce, which is a circumstance outside of her control \nthat adversely affected her finances. She showed her good faith, and she resolved all of \nthe SOR debts. There is sufficient assurance her financial problems are resolved, under \ncontrol, and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, she established that \nfinancial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nSexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 contains the security concern for sexual behavior: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 includes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  and \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n \nApplicant advertised for her services from 2016 to 2017 using her semi-nude \nphotographs to encourage customers to call her. Some of her customers engaged in \nsexual activity with Applicant, and then some of them paid her $80 for 30 minutes, or $150 \nfor 60 minutes. Each time she engaged in sexual activity and received payment \nafterwards at this hourly rate from her customers, she committed a form of the prostitution \noffense.   \n \nIn a recent Appeal Board case, the Appeal Board assessed the security \nimplications of an applicant\u2019s claim that his behavior did not constitute prostitution as \nfollows: \n \n[He and his friend] each dated a couple of different women on this trip, they \npaid their bar fees, went to dinner and/ or dancing, and engaged in \nconsensual sexual activity. [He] engaged in sex with at least one to two \nwomen while on this trip. When they pay the bar fee, it does not mean they \nare paying for sex, sex is never discussed, and the women are not obligated \nto sleep with the men who pay their bar fee to take them out. Prostitution is \nillegal in Thailand. The women that they engaged in sexual activity with \nwere adults, and it was always consensual sex (no other details recalled). \n \n* \n* \n* \n \nApplicant\u2019s contention that he is not participating in prostitution brings to \nmind a Latin phrase, \u201cres ipsa loquitur,\u201d i.e., the thing speaks for itself. He \npaid money to engage in casual, sexual encounters. Despite his claim to \nthe contrary, the routine practice of paying a fee to remove random women \nfrom bars and then later on that same occasion engage in sexual activity \nwith them is a form of prostitution. In the above indented quote, Applicant \nadmitted that prostitution is illegal in Thailand. Disqualifying Condition 13(a) \nwas established. \n \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s conduct is at the very least high-risk sexual \nbehavior that calls into question his judgment. Such behavior establishes \ndisqualifying conditions under Guideline E that address conduct involving \nquestionable judgment. \n \nISCR Case No. 16-03690 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2018) (footnotes omitted). Applicant\u2019s \nconduct established AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d). \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant refused to admit that she \nengaged in the offense of prostitution. Taking responsibility for one\u2019s conduct is often \nconsidered the first step on the road to rehabilitation. Her multiple misdemeanor-level \ncriminal offenses of prostitution are relatively recent. She remains vulnerable to \nprosecution for the offenses until the statute of limitations runs. She is also vulnerable to \ncoercion for her conduct. She did not receive any therapy or counseling. She failed to \ndeclare her income on her 2016 federal income tax return from customers meeting her \nbased on her webpage advertisement. Guideline D security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 described the concern relating to criminal conduct as follows: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 includes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program; and \n \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \n \nAs discussed in the sexual behavior section, supra, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are \nestablished.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nAs indicated in the sexual behavior section, supra, none of the mitigating \nconditions fully apply.  \n  \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 includes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include:  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant engaged in multiple misdemeanor-level acts of prostitution, which are \nviolations of the rules or statutes. Such conduct adversely affects her professional and \ncommunity standing. She failed to timely report that the police cited her for prostitution to \nher security officer, which is violation of a security rule.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n\n \n15 \n                                         \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s delay in reporting her citation by the police for prostitution to her \nsecurity officer was based on the advice of counsel. AG \u00b6 17(b) applies, and SOR \u00b6 4.b \nis mitigated. None of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct as described \nin the sexual behavior section, supra. SOR \u00b6 4.a is not mitigated. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F, D, J, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, and a DOD contractor employs her as a management \nspecialist in Afghanistan. She served in the Army from 1996 to 2000, and she received \nan honorable discharge. In 2006, she received an associate\u2019s degree.  \n \nApplicant mitigated the allegations under Guideline F. She made diligent and \neffective efforts to establish her financial responsibility. She resolved all of the debts listed \non her SOR.  \n \nIn 2018, Applicant received two promotions and a certificate of appreciation from \nher employer. She served in Afghanistan in 2014, and she was serving in Afghanistan at \nthe time of her hearing. Her program manager has known her since 2000. He described \nher as an excellent employee who is conscientious, reliable, and responsible. She did not \ncommit any security or rule violations. He supported her for positions of greater \nresponsibility and a security clearance.    \n\n \n16 \n                                         \n \nApplicant advertised for her services from 2016 to 2017 using her semi-nude \nphotographs to encourage customers to call her. After her customers engaged in sexual \nactivity with Applicant, they sometimes paid her $80 for 30 minutes, or $150 for 60 \nminutes. Each time she engaged in sexual activity and received payment of her hourly \nfee afterwards from her customers for such services, she committed a form of the \nprostitution offense. She continues to be vulnerable to prosecution for prostitution until \nthe statute of limitations runs. Applicant did not include the income she received for her \nservices on her federal income tax return.    \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in \nthe context of the whole person. Unmitigated sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and \npersonal conduct security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance \nto Applicant is not warranted.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.r: \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.d: Against Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraph 4.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Heather C. Tenney, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 23, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 15, 2017, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 13, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing (NOH) \non May 11, 2018, scheduling the hearing for June 12, 2018. Applicant retained an \nattorney on May 24, 2018, and requested a continuance for additional time to prepare. \n02/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nWith no objection, I granted Applicant\u2019s request and DOHA issued an amended NOH on \nMay 29, 2018, rescheduling the hearing for July 9, 2018. I convened the hearing as \nrescheduled. \n \nI appended to the record, as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, the Government\u2019s discovery \nletter and exhibit list. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, \nwhich I admitted in evidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record \nopen until July 23, 2018, for additional evidence. By that date, Applicant submitted \nadditional documentation, which I marked as AE E and admitted in evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 13, 2018.  \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. He is 49 years old. He married in \n1991, divorced in 1995, remarried in 1996, divorced in 2011, and remarried in 2011. He \nhas three children: one is an adult from his second marriage, and the other two are \nminors from his current marriage.1 \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1987, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1992, and earned a juris doctorate degree in 1995. He worked in state law enforcement \nfrom around 2001 to 2007, and he has since served as a reserve officer. He has worked \nfor various DOD contractors since 2008. As of the date of the hearing, he worked as a \ndivision vice president for a DOD contractor since January 2018. He has never held a \nsecurity clearance.2  \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges a delinquent consumer account for $5,709 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and a \nstate tax lien from December 2006 for $31,253 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). SOR \u00b6 1.a is established \nby a 2017 credit bureau report. Applicant disclosed and discussed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \nin his 2015 security clearance application (SCA), 2016 background interview, and 2017 \nresponse to interrogatories.3  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for the outstanding balance on an apartment lease placed in \ncollection for $5,709. Applicant and his wife broke their lease seven months early. She \nunexpectedly became pregnant with their second child in 2013 and they decided they \nneeded to rent a bigger place. Prior to breaking the lease, he unsuccessfully attempted \nto work with the apartment company to resolve the outstanding balance, but was told \nthere was nothing that could be done and his balance would be placed in collection.4  \n \n                                                     \n1 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 18-77; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 5-6, 18-77; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n3 GE 1-4; AE A, E. \n \n4 Tr. at 22-27, 40-43, 61-66; GE 1, 2, 4; AE A, D. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn 2014, Applicant unsuccessfully attempted to work with the collection agency \nwhen he received a demand letter for payment. The collection agency only wanted a full \nor a half payment, which he could not then afford. He paid a security deposit and the \nfirst and last month\u2019s rent on his new rental; he was paying child support for his eldest \nchild; and he was ensuring that his mortgage on his home, as further discussed below, \nremained current. He stopped trying to work with the collection agency in 2014, when it \nthreatened to sue him. Between 2014 and 2017, he received telephone calls from the \ncollection agency demanding payment in full, which he still could not then afford.5  \n \n \nIn December 2017, Applicant contacted the collection agency to try to resolve the \ndebt. He was motivated, in part, from having received the August 2017 SOR. He \nmanaged to rebuild his credit, and he had a credit card that he could use to resolve the \ndebt. He also had enough money in his 401k retirement account that he could use, if \nnecessary. He sought to pay in full with his credit card, only to learn that the collection \nagency stopped accepting any payments from his credit-card company. In May 2018, \nhe resolved the account in full with a loan from his 401k retirement account.6 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $31,253 state tax lien entered against Applicant in 2006. \nApplicant attributed the lien to incorrect advice that he and his parents received from a \ncertified public accountant (CPA) in 2003. In around 2000, his parents put his name on \ntheir home; the home was fully paid, he was living in it, and they retired and wanted to \nmove elsewhere. When he sold the home in 2003 and gave the money to his parents, \nthe CPA advised him that he would not have to pay taxes on the proceeds from the sale \nof the home.7 \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant received a letter from the IRS and the state Department of \nRevenue (DOR), informing him that he owed back taxes on the sale of the home in the \namounts of approximately $60,000 to the IRS and $30,000 to the state DOR, for a total \nof $90,000. He could not then afford to pay the back taxes, as he earned $30,000 \nannually working as a state police officer and his then-wife was a bank teller. The IRS \nand the state consequently placed tax liens on his home, which he and his first wife \npurchased in 2004, effectively preventing him from selling it. His ability to sell the home \nwas further hampered when the economic downturn affected its value from 2006 \nthrough 2010.8  \n \n \nApplicant testified that his and his then-wife\u2019s yearly federal income tax refunds \nfrom 2006 to 2017, totaling approximately $5,000 to $10,000, were applied to the \n$60,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS, and the IRS released its lien in 2016. He \ntestified that his yearly state income tax refunds from 2006 to 2009,9 and his then-wife\u2019s \n                                                     \n5 Tr. at 22-27, 40-43, 61-66; GE 1, 2, 4; AE A, D. \n \n6 Tr. at 22-27, 40-43, 61-66; GE 1, 2, 4; AE A, D. \n \n7 Tr. at 27-35, 43-56, 66-77; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, E. \n \n8 Tr. at 27-35, 43-56, 66-77; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, E. \n \n9 Applicant moved out of that state in 2008. Tr. at 48, 55-56. \n\n \n4 \n \nyearly state tax refunds from 2006 to 2014, totaling approximately $3,000 to $5,000, \nwere applied to the $30,000 in back taxes owed to the state DOR. He testified that the \nstate has not made any efforts to collect on its lien since 2014. He hired an attorney in \n2017 to assist him with resolving the outstanding state tax lien, though she had been \nadvising him since the lien was placed against his home in 2006 because he has known \nher for a long time both professionally and personally. He testified that his attorney \nadvised him against setting up a payment plan for the back taxes when his and his \nthen-wife\u2019s federal and state income tax refunds were being intercepted, since the IRS \nand the state DOR already placed a lien against his property and he could not then \nafford a payment plan; he testified that he also did not attempt an offer-in-compromise \n(OIC) because he could not then afford a sufficient offer amount to do so.10 \n \n \nIn 2017, Applicant started to see value return to his home, and he had $50,000 in \nequity in it as of the date of the hearing. However, he testified that he had not listed the \nhome for sale because the existing lien would prevent him from securing a buyer. His \nattorney advised him that his best course of action is to find a qualified buyer who is \naware of the lien on the home; notify the state DOR that they have a qualified buyer; \nnegotiate with the state DOR on an OIC for the outstanding state tax lien; and use the \nproceeds from the sale of the home to resolve the negotiated OIC for the lien. He \nintends to follow his attorney\u2019s advice. His attorney is assisting him with finding a \nqualified buyer for the home. His prior renter from 2015 to 2018 desired to purchase the \nhome, but she ultimately did not qualify for financing. His current renter desires to get \nprequalified to purchase the home, but her efforts are at a standstill until her pending \ndivorce is final. He believed the balance on the state tax lien as of the date of the \nhearing was approximately $50,000 to $60,000, with penalties and interest.11 \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s household annual income was $254,000 as of the date of the \nhearing. His wife started working as a teacher in 2018. In 2008, his annual income was \napproximately $78,000; in 2009, it was $90,000; in 2012 it was $150,000; in 2015 it was \n$170,000; and in 2016 it was $185,000. He has approximately $8,000 in savings and \n$30,000 in his 401k retirement account. After his income and expenses, his monthly net \nremainder is approximately $1,000. He testified that he has timely filed his federal and \nstate income tax returns. He does not have any other delinquent debts. He is current on \nhis expenses, to include his mortgage of $1,000 monthly and repayment of his 401(k) \nloan. Other than the financial advice given to him by his attorney, he has not received \nfinancial counseling.12 \n \n \n \nTwo former supervisors described Applicant as an exemplary worker and a man \nof professional integrity. Applicant\u2019s landlord from 2016 to at least 2018, who also \nconsidered Applicant a friend, attested to Applicant\u2019s timely rental payments as well as \n                                                     \n10 Tr. at 27-35, 43-56, 66-77; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, E. \n \n11 Tr. at 27-35, 43-56, 66-77; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, E. \n \n12 Tr. at 35-40, 50-51, 56-61, 74-75; GE 4; AE B, D. \n\n \n5 \n \nhis trustworthiness and unquestionable ethics. Other character references also \ndescribed Applicant as a responsible and diligent individual.13 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n                                                     \n13 AE C. \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts, to include a state tax lien from 2006. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) and 19(f) as disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n7 \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nFor the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under his circumstances. He credibly testified that he unsuccessfully tried to \nwork with the apartment company and the collection agency for SOR \u00b6 1.a prior to the \nSOR. He then continued his efforts upon receipt of the SOR and when he had the \nfinancial capability to resolve this debt, which he did in May 2018. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) \nand 20(d) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \nApplicant\u2019s ability to sell his home to satisfy the state tax lien in SOR \u00b6 1.b was \nhampered when the economic downturn affected the home\u2019s value from 2006 through \n2010. He credibly testified that though he did not hire an attorney to assist him with \nresolving the lien until 2017, the attorney has given him advice, which he has been \nfollowing, since the lien was entered against him 2006. On the attorney\u2019s advice, he \nrelied upon the state DOR\u2019s interception of his and his then-wife\u2019s yearly state income \ntax refunds from 2006 to 2014, collectively, to resolve the lien during this period. He did \nnot attempt to set up a payment plan or present an OIC to the state DOR. He indicated \nthat he also lacked the income during this period, however he has earned upwards of \n$150,000 annually since at least 2012. He did not list the home for sale because he \ntestified that the existing lien would prevent him from securing a buyer. \n \nApplicant believed the balance on the lien as of the date of the hearing was \napproximately $50,000 to $60,000. On his attorney\u2019s advice, he planned to find a \nqualified buyer who is aware of the lien on the home; notify the state DOR that they \nhave a qualified buyer; negotiate with the state DOR on an OIC for the outstanding state \ntax lien; and use the proceeds from the sale of the home to resolve the negotiated OIC \nfor the lien. He intends to follow his attorney\u2019s advice. As of the date of the hearing, he \nhad not secured a qualifier buyer, as his prior renter from 2015 to 2018 did not qualify \nfor financing, and his current renter\u2019s efforts to secure financing are at a standstill until \nshe finalizes her divorce. As such, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) \ndo not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017. \n    \n \nOn July 18, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on December 13, \n2017. The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2018. The hearing was initially \nscheduled for February 27, 2019.  Applicant\u2019s request for a delay was granted. On \nFebruary 26, 2019, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for April 3, \n2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. During the hearing, the Government offered \nten exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 10. A File of \nRelevant Material, dated August 23, 2017, was not admitted as evidence, but was \nmarked as HE II. Applicant testified and offered 16 exhibits which were admitted as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A - P. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 15, 2019. Based \n\n \n2 \n \n \nupon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking to maintain a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since \nAugust 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1994 to \nDecember 2003. He separated as an E-5 with an honorable discharge. Between \nDecember 2010 and December 2011, Applicant was unemployed. In 2010, he lost his \njob as a result of a reckless driving offense, which resulted in him serving 15 days in jail. \nDuring this period of unemployment, he lived off savings and took college courses. \nBetween 2011 and 2018, he served in the Air National Guard. He has worked for \nvarious DoD contractors as well as other jobs. He is a high school graduate, has \nattended college courses, but does not have a degree. He is single and has no children. \n(Tr. 32- 38; Gov 1; Gov 2; Gov 9)   \n \nApplicant has held security clearances in the past. On February 4, 2000, the \nArmy issued an SOR and notified Applicant of their intent to deny his access to \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) and classified information for financial \nreasons.  Applicant submitted a response to the SOR. Based on his answer, the Army \nCentral Clearance Facility (CCF) reinstated his security clearance and access to SCI on \nJune 7, 2000. The Army CCF warned Applicant that retention of his SCI access \neligibility and security clearance was contingent upon Applicant not incurring any further \nfinancial mismanagement or other personal behavior that would render him ineligible. \n(Gov 8)   \n \nOn February 14, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application as \npart of a periodic reinvestigation. In \u201cSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record\u201d of the application, \nhe disclosed a delinquent debt owed to a homeowner\u2019s association; delinquent student \nloans; a delinquent car loan; and a delinquent military exchange account. (Gov 1, \nsection 26) \n \nA subsequent security clearance background investigation resulted in the  \nfollowing SOR allegations: failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 10, 15);  a delinquent federal \ntax debt in the amount of $7,561 for tax year 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 10, 15, 19); a \n$995 delinquent state income tax debt for tax year 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: AE A at 6, 13, 14, \n36); a mortgage account that was delinquent in the amount of $3,596, with an \napproximate total balance of $287,763 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 1 at 11; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 7); \na $5,065 judgment from a home owner\u2019s association filed in October 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: \nGov 1 at 12; Gov 4 at 4); a $2,830 judgment filed in May 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 1 at 10; \nGov 4 at 4); a $6,917 charged-off car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 1 at 2; Gov 3 at 2); and a \n$2,948 charged-off account motorcycle loan. (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 3 at 2). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant admits that he did not file his federal and state income tax returns for  \ntax years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Applicant states that he got into tax problems \nbecause of financial problems from being unemployed, trying to maintain his mortgage \npayments, and the stress from his mother and his guardian both suffering from terminal \nillnesses at the same time. Applicant testified he was stressed out about his mother\u2019s \nillness. He focused on his mother, forgot about paying bills, and did not pay attention to \nthe mail.  His mother passed away in 2016. (Tr. 39-40; Gov 2) \n \n Applicant\u2019s federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 were \nfiled on March 11, 2017, a few days before submitting his answer to DOHA \ninterrogatories on March 13, 2017.  In his answer to interrogatories, Applicant stated: \u201cI \ndo intend to pay all the monies owed to the IRS with the payment plan, as discussed \nwith the IRS. I plan on filing on time this year for my 2016 taxes. Please allow me to \nremedy these issues; I will be able to do so. I can provide the payment agreement once \nI receive it.\u201d (Gov 2 at 15)  \n \nApplicant is still attempting to file his 2012 federal tax return. He obtained his W-2 \nforms for tax years 2013-2015 online. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not post \nthe 2012 W-2 online. Applicant has to contact the IRS directly in order to get his W-2 for \n2012. Applicant received refunds for tax years 2013 and 2014. He owes federal income \ntaxes for tax year 2015. He originally owed around $7,561. The balance is now $3,324. \nHe was on a payment agreement for a period of time. The IRS did not allow him to \ncontinue with the payment agreement because he did not timely file his 2016 and 2017 \nincome tax returns. (Tr. 41-44; AE A; AE B)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017 were filed \napproximately one week before the hearing. He owes about $4,651 for tax year 2016 \nand is expecting a refund for tax year 2017 of $2,723. He also expects a refund for tax \nyear 2018 of 5,252. The IRS will apply the refunds towards the taxes he owes for 2015 \nand 2016. Applicant did not timely file his federal tax returns for 2016 and 2017 because \nhe was dealing with issues with his mortgage and was attending school. His house \npayment increased from $1,600 to $2,200 and he was trying to keep his house. (Tr. 45-\n47; AE L; AE M; AE N)   \n  \nApplicant\u2019s 2010 reckless driving offense, his previous financial issues that raised \na security concern in 2000, his failure to timely file his 2016 and 2017 federal income \ntax returns, and his $4,651 federal tax debt for tax year 2016 were not alleged in the \nSOR as disqualifying conduct. I considered these facts when evaluating evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation, or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2016)  \n  \nRegarding the state income tax returns, Applicant filed his state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 in March 2017. He has not filed his 2012 \nstate income tax return. His 2016, 2017 and 2018 state tax returns were filed with his \nfederal tax returns in early April 2019. Applicant owes $955 in state income taxes for tax \n\n \n4 \n \n \nyear 2015. He owes $453 in state income taxes for tax year 2016. He anticipates \nreceiving a refund of $862 for tax year 2017 and a refund of $1,285 for tax year 2018.  \nHe anticipates the refunds will be applied towards his state tax debt. He anticipates that  \nall state and federal taxes owed will be paid by the end of 2019. (Tr. 48-51; AE A; AE C; \nAEL; AE M; AE N)  \n \nThe status of the SOR debts other than the tax debts are: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: $3,596 delinquent home mortgage account:  Applicant purchased the \nhouse in January 2010. He tried to keep up with is mortgage payments, but the \nmortgage went to foreclosure in August 2018.  Applicant claims he owes nothing \nbecause the house sold for more than the mortgage balance. (Tr. 51-52, 77; AE A at \n16-17; AE C)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $5,065 judgment owed to a homeowner\u2019s association (HOA):  \nApplicant failed to pay the monthly HOA fees of $95. The HOA would add a $25 late fee \neach month that he was late. The balance of the judgment includes attorney\u2019s fees. \nApplicant\u2019s paycheck was garnished $194.37.  In total, approximately $2,493 was \ngarnished. The remaining balance is around $3,400. In March 2019, Applicant agreed to \npay $500 monthly towards the debt. He did not provide proof of payments made in April \n2019 in accordance with the payment plan. (Tr. 54-58; AE A at 19-23; AE F) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: $2,830 judgment entered in 2012: Applicant testified that this was for \na watch that he bought on credit for $3,000 in 2010.  Applicant satisfied this judgment. \n(Tr. 59-61; AE A at 25-26; AE H at 22-23) \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.g:  $6,917 car loan that was charged off:  Applicant purchased this car \nin late 2009. Applicant reduced the balance to $3,416. He is still attempting to settle this \naccount. He last contacted the debtor in 2017 in an attempt to settle the account. Status \nremains unpaid. (Tr. 63-65; AE A at 28-29)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h: $2,948 motorcycle loan that was charged off: Applicant purchased \nthis motorcycle in February 2010. He paid this account in April 2017. (Tr. 63-64; AE A at \n30-31; AE G; AE H at 20)    \n \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant also has a delinquent military \nexchange debt. He currently is making payments towards this debt. (Tr. 66; AE 10)  \n \nApplicant is currently staying with a friend. He has been paying his debts for \nabout a year. He does not owe any other debts. He has not made any major purchases. \nHis net monthly income is $3,500. Applicant applies most of his income to his debts. He \ntimely pays $349 towards his student loan debt. He has not attended recent financial \ncounseling. When he encountered finance-related security clearance issues in early \n2000, his command sent him to financial counseling. The financial counseling helped \nhim organize his bills. Applicant has not vacationed in years. He intends to make \n\n \n5 \n \n \npayments towards all of his remaining debts monthly until they are paid in full. (Tr. 68-\n76)    \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n6 \n \n \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems since around 2011. He failed to \ntimely file his state and federal income tax returns from 2012 to 2015. He owes state \nand federal taxes from tax year 2015. He was unable to pay his mortgage resulting in \nforeclosure in August 2018. He incurred a significant debt to his HOA resulting in a \n$5,065 judgment entered against him in 2012. Another $2,830 judgment was entered \nagainst him for failure to make payments towards a loan to purchase an expensive \nwatch. Finally, two loans he took out to purchase an automobile in late 2009 and a \nmotorcycle in February 2010, resulted in charged-off accounts, in the amounts of \n$6,917 and $2,948. The total approximate amount of the debts alleged in the SOR \nincluding the 2015 state and federal tax debts, but not including the mortgage, is \n$26,316. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \n  \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \n\n \n7 \n \n \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5) \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control:  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. \nWhile Applicant has filed his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014 and \n2015, he still owes taxes for 2015. He has not filed his tax returns for 2012. Applicant \nstill owes a significant debt to his HOA, and to a bank for an automobile loan. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems, it is too soon to conclude that his \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. His conduct towards resolving his tax debts was \nnot proactive. As a contract employee entrusted with a security clearance, Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nshould have been aware of his duty to file and pay his federal and state income taxes in \na timely manner. He almost lost his security clearance in 2000 because of financial \nissues. He was given another chance, but continued to have financial issues. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility and his failure to file state and federal tax \nreturns in a timely manner over a six-year period raises questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant\u2019s financial situation was adversely \naffected by his under-employment while a full-time student and his one year period or \nunemployment between late 2010 to 2011. However, Applicant\u2019s job loss was the result \nof his reckless driving offense in May 2010. This mitigating condition is given less \nweight. I considered that Applicant dealt with the added stress of his mother\u2019s terminal \nillness and the death of his guardian. Despite these challenges, one must still follow \nthrough with one\u2019s financial obligations. This mitigating condition is given less weight \nbecause I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has been continuously employed since 2012, yet he did not timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns from 2012 to 2017.  (The 2016 and 2017 federal \nand state income tax returns can be considered under matters of mitigation, even \nthough they were not alleged in the SOR.) I cannot conclude Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances with regard to his delinquent debts and his tax \nissues. \n    \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant attended financial counseling around 2000, \nwhen he encountered financial issues when he served in the Air National Guard. He \nwas notified that he was about to lose his security clearance and access to SCI. His \ncommand gave him a chance and sent him to financial counseling. His security \nclearance and SCI access were reinstated on the condition that he keep his financial \nissues under control. Applicant did not take this warning to heart and has continued to \nencounter financial problems.   \n \n \nAG & 20(d) partially applies towards the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.f and \n1.h. Applicant filed his late federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013, \n2014, and 2015. Credit is also given to Applicant regarding his mortgage and the \naccounts that he has paid and settled. However, he has not filed his federal and state \ntax returns for 2012, still owes a balance on his state and federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2015 and 2016, and continued to be late filing his federal and state income tax \nreturns for 2016 and 2017, filing them one week before the hearing with no reasonable  \nexplanation for the delay. I cannot conclude that Applicant has made a good-faith effort \nregarding his tax debts.  His state and federal tax debts remain unresolved.  \n \nAG & 20(g) does not apply. With regard to Applicant\u2019s federal tax debts, the \nrecent emphasis of the DOHA Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax \ncases is instructive. ISCR Case No. 17-01807 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018) states: \n \nThe mere filing of delinquent tax returns . . . does not compel a Judge to \nissue a favorable decision. As with the application of any mitigating \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncondition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide \nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or \nvice versa. The timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the \nJudge to consider in the application of mitigating condition 20(g) as well as \nin considering aspects of other overlapping mitigating condition[s].  \n \nSee also ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of \nsecurity clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency \nfor years and then taking action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy \nundercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect \nthe voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with \nthe nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing \ngrant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed). See also ISCR Case No. \n14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, and \nstating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the \nprotection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d).  \n \nAt the close of the record, Applicant had not filed his state and federal tax returns \nfor 2012, even though he had sufficient time to do so. He did not consistently make \npayments towards his 2015 federal and state tax debts. He failed to timely file his \nfederal and state tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017. Applicant claims that his state \nand federal tax debts will be resolved by applying refunds and possible payments if \nneeded by the end of 2019.  A promise to pay or resolve an issue in the future does not \nmitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s tax situation. Applicant\u2019s history of \nconsistently failing to timely file his federal and state tax returns over a six-year period is \ngiven more weight than his last minute attempts to resolve his tax issues and other \ndebts.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n       I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s career with \nfederal contractors. I considered his honorable service in the United States Army from \n1994 to 2003, and his service in the Air National Guard from 2011 to 2018. \n \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s one year period of unemployment from 2010 to 2011 \nand several years of under-employment adversely affected his household finances. I \nalso considered Applicant was laid off because of his own misconduct. He continued to \nignore his financial obligations by failing to timely file his state and federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2012 \u2013 2015. Despite Applicant\u2019s expressed intentions to timely file \nhis income tax returns for tax year 2016, he did not do so. He also failed to timely file his \n2017 income tax returns. While Applicant filed all of his federal and state tax returns \n(with the exception of tax year 2012) a few weeks before the hearing, significant tax \ndebt remained at the close of the record. Applicant was not proactive in bringing his \nstate and federal tax situation under control. He has resolved several of his debts, but \nseveral of the debts remain unresolved at the close of the record. While not alleged in \nthe SOR, during the hearing, it was discovered that Applicant encountered financial \nissues in the past which adversely affected his security clearance. He was given \nanother chance with the warning that he should keep his financial situation under \ncontrol. Despite this warning, Applicant continued to demonstrate a pattern of financial \nirresponsibility. Security concerns under financial considerations are not mitigated.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.c, 1.e, and 1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 23, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On June 16, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nFebruary 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines \nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective on June 8, 2017.   \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). \n02/05/2019\n\n \n2                                                                                                                                             \nOn July 18, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision on \nthe written record. When he obtained counsel, Applicant elected to have a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (HE I) On August 9, 2018, the case was assigned to me. \nOn September 24, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing, setting the hearing for November 15, 2018. Applicant\u2019s hearing was \nheld as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits; there were no \nobjections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 13; \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-3. At the hearing, Applicant provided eleven exhibits, (AE) \nA-K, which were admitted without objection. On November 26, 2018, DOHA received a \ntranscript of the hearing.   \n \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, established in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. I have \nevaluated Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility under the new AGs. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel offered a summary for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Saudi Arabia.  \n(Tr. 8) Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice of facts concerning \nSaudi Arabia, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. Administrative or official \nnotice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR \nCase No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice \nat ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government \nreports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing \nfifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Portions of the Department Counsel\u2019s \nrequests are quoted without quotation marks and footnotes. \n \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant admitted five allegations and denied two of the SOR allegations. He \nalso provided mitigating information. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 56 years old, and was born in Egypt to Jordanian parents. He \nrenounced his Jordanian citizenship a few years ago, and he was never an Egyptian \ncitizen. (GE 2)  Applicant lived in Egypt with his family where he attended an English \n                                            \n1 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy.

In 1984, he obtained his undergraduate degree in business management. (AE \nA, B)  After college, he worked in Saudi Arabia for an international company. He was \npromoted and moved to Egypt. He left Egypt in 2000 to come to the United States. (GE \n2). Applicant wanted to be in the United States due to the many opportunities for himself \nand his children. \n \nIn 1982, Applicant married, and in 2016, he divorced. (AE K) He has three \nchildren from his marriage. In 2000, he immigrated to the United States with his then- \nwife and children. In 2007, Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen. (AE C)  \nIn  2009, he obtained a security clearance. \n \nApplicant has worked as a linguist for the U.S. Army since June 2006. (AE B) He \nserved as a linguist on a military installation from 2006 to 2007 in Iraq. After that, in \n2008, he returned to Iraq to again work for the U.S. Army and lived on an installation. \nApplicant was then assigned to three different locations in combat zones. Applicant has \nreceived many letters of commendation from officers with whom he worked. Each attests \nto his exceptional ability to aid as a cultural advisor and translator. Applicant is intelligent \nand hard working. He was instrumental for a successful mission in Iraq. (AE F) The U.S. \nofficer stated that Applicant is \u201crecognized as one of the top linguists in the area\u201d. He \nparticipated in dangerous missions. Applicant received awards and certificates for his \nservice in Iraq and Kuwait. (AE H)  \n \n Applicant has a retirement account and savings in the United States.(AE I) He \ndoes not have any property or bank accounts in foreign countries. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife \nlives in the United States and has no foreign property. Applicant has siblings and cousins \nin the United States. \n \nThe SOR raises the following foreign influence security concerns:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant\u2019s father, brother and sister are citizens of Jordan \nand reside in Saudi Arabia. Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Jordan. (GE 1) His mother \nis deceased. Applicant admits this allegation. He had not seen his family members when \nhe was in Kuwait, but now that he is in Saudi Arabia he visited his father once. The \nfamily members are not allowed on base without an invitation. The family members have \nnot been to the base. (Tr. 22) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant\u2019s brother claims citizenship with the United States \nand Canada. He resides in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 22) He is not connected to the government \nof Saudi Arabia. (Tr.) Applicant communicates with him once every few years.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant\u2019s sister is a U.S. citizen living in Saudi Arabia.   \nApplicant said his sister is married and she and her children live in Saudi Arabia. She is \na U.S. citizen. Now that Applicant is in Saudi Arabia, he sees his sister for lunch on \noccasion.   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant\u2019s child is a dual citizen of Jordan and the United \nStates residing in Egypt. She has moved to the United States and holds a U.S. passport. \n(Tr. 23) She is a university professor. (Tr. 24)  \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a Jordanian citizen residing in \nSaudi Arabia. Applicant denied this allegation as his brother-in-law is a United States \ncitizen, and holds no other citizenship. He has no contact with him since his divorce. (Tr. \n10)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is an Egyptian citizen living in Egypt. \nApplicant has no contact with her.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant\u2019s father is a retired member of the Saudi Arabia \nMinistry of Information. This is not accurate. Applicant\u2019s father worked for the ministry for \none year a long time ago, and disputes that he retired from the ministry. His father is ill \nand elderly (80). Applicant calls his father once every ten days.  \n \n Saudi Arabia \n \nThe United States and Saudi Arabia generally have good relations and share a \ncommon concern about regional security in the Middle East. Relations between the \nUnited States and Saudi Arabia were strained after the September 2001 terrorist attacks. \nDuring 2003 and 2004, terrorists and suicide bombers kidnapped or killed Americans \nand attacked the U.S. consulate. Terrorist attacks have been attempted or have occurred \nin the last several years. The State Department warns U.S. citizens to carefully consider \nthe risks of travel to Saudi Arabia due to concerns about potential terrorist activity \ndirected against U.S. citizens and interests.  \n \nIndividuals and organizations based in Saudi Arabia have been designated by \nthe U.S. government as providing financial and material support to al-Qa\u2019eda and more \nrecently to ISIL and other terrorist groups. Violence from the conflict in Yemen has \noccasionally \u201cspilled over\u201d into Saudi Arabia with numerous projectiles being launched  \nfrom Yemen into Saudi Arabia. Human rights problems have occurred throughout Saudi \nArabia. \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

They may also be a national security concern \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant admitted: (1) his father and sister are residents of Saudi Arabia, and he \nhas some contact with them; (2) his child is a U.S citizen and lives in the United States; \n(3) his sister is a U.S. citizen residing in Saudi Arabia; (4) he does not have contact with \nhis sister-in-law or brother-in-law living in Egypt.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \n Applicant has voluntarily shared in dangers from terrorists on behalf of the DOD \nwhen he was deployed to Iraq as a U.S. Army translator, and he is willing to do so in the \nfuture. Numerous linguists, supporting U.S. forces, have family living in countries that \nhave problems with terrorists and criminals. Thousands of United States and coalition \narmed forces and civilian contractors serving in the Middle East and Afghanistan are \ntargets of terrorists, along with their families.   \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Saudi Arabia is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his \nor her spouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-\n02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s \nfather to Iran).2  \n  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Saudi Arabia with the United States, and the situation in that country \nplaces a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationships with any family member living in or visiting those countries does not pose a \ntrustworthiness or security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he \nmight be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a \nrelative living in or visiting Saudi Arabia.3  \n \n                                            \n2 In accordance with \u201cwell established DoD policy [Applicant and his family\u2019s] religious affiliation \nplay[ed] no part\u201d in this decision. ISCR Case No. 08-06795 at 6 n. 3 (App. Bd. May 25, 2012). \n3 The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 n. 18 (App. \nBd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security significance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family members in \na foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on their prominence or personal \nsituation. Rather, the issue is whether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an \napplicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance [or public trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries \nhostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting \nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is \nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, \n2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Saudi Arabia, seek or have sought classified or economic information from or \nthrough Applicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a \npossibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Saudi Arabia has a \nsignificant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in Saudi Arabia \u201ccould \nbe a means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. \ninformation or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP \nCase No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Saudi Arabia, or visiting \nthose countries create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place \npressure on his family in Saudi Arabia, in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise \nclassified information. These relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel \nproduced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with family in Saudi Arabia,  \nand has raised the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of \nany mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nApplicant does not have frequent contacts with his sister and brother-in-law in \nSaudi Arabia. His father is ill and elderly. His child is a U.S. citizen living in the United \nStates. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f are mitigated because of Applicant\u2019s lack of \ncontacts and connections with these relatives living in Saudi Arabia or Egypt. He does \nnot send any money to any relatives.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies. Applicant has frequent contact with or a close \nrelationship with his father, who is a resident of Saudi Arabia. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 \n8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S.\u201d Applicant resided in the United States from 2000 to present, except for the years \nfrom 2006 to the present when he served as a linguist in combat zones.4 In 2007, \n                                            \n4 ISCR Case No. 17-00629 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018) the Appeal Board discussed a translator\u2019s \nmultiple tours on behalf of the United States in Iraq, limited time as a resident in the United States, and \nconnections to family living in Iraq. The Appeal Board stated: \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen. His daughter is in the United States and has a U.S. \npassport. Applicant has served the U.S. Army and has received numerous \ncommendations from the military officers in the U.S. Army. His retirement account and \nsavings are in the United States. He has no foreign connections or property. He \nhonorably served as a linguist in war zones for the U.S. Army, which included a tour in \nIraq. \n      \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Iraq, including the dangers that service entailed, \nweighs heavily towards mitigating security concerns. Applicant seeks to renew a security \nclearance to enable him to continue serving the Middle East providing assistance to \nDOD. He has shown his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his \nsupport to DOD while serving in Iraq and other dangerous locations.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of \ndangerous high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant \ncontribution to national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n5, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are residents \nof Saudi Arabia. Applicant has close relationships with family in Saudi Arabia when he \nworks on a military installation in Saudi Arabia. He did not have contact when he was in \nIraq and other places.  \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in the Middle East, and Applicant has supported U.S. goals and \nobjectives in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s relatives living in Saudi Arabia are potential targets of \n                                                                                                                                            \n     \nIn general, an applicant\u2019s deployment to a combat zone in support of U.S. forces is not a \nfactor that weighs against his or her national security eligibility. On the contrary, such \ndeployments tend to establish various mitigating conditions such as [Directive] \u00b6 8(b) \n(\u201cthere is no conflict of interest . . . because . . . the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d); [Directive] \u00b6 8(d) (\u201cthe foreign . . . \nactivities are on U.S. Government business\u201d); and [Directive] \u00b6 8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine \nnature of the foreign business . . . is such that [it is] unlikely to result in a conflict of \ninterest and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.\u201d) \n \nId. at 3 (internal footnotes omitted) (remanding administrative judge\u2019s denial of security clearance). \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nterrorists, and Applicant\u2019s potential access to classified information could theoretically \nadd risk to his relatives living in those countries from lawless elements in Saudi Arabia. \n   \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Saudi Arabia, are \noutweighed by his service to the United States.  He has mitigated the circumstances in \nthis case. His connections to the United States taken together are sufficient to \novercome the foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant is 56 years old, and he came to the United States in 2000. He is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen who has, since 2006, served as a linguist for the United States \nArmy in war zones. He has held a security clearance since 2009. He renounced his \nJordanian citizenship and is only committed to the United States. His daughter has \nmoved to the United States and has a U.S passport.   \n \n \n     Applicant resided in the United States from 2000 until he began his work as a \nlinguist in 2006.  He has bank accounts in the United States. He has received \ncommendations from the U.S. military. He took the oath of allegiance to the United \nStates when he became a U.S. citizen.  \n \nApplicant served in Iraq and several other war zones. He made contributions at \npersonal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Iraq. All these circumstances increase \nthe probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign \npower, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit him. See ISCR Case No. \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \n07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). His past honorable service in Iraq weighs \nheavily towards mitigating  foreign influence security concerns. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n00034 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (affirming grant of security clearance and \ncommenting \u201cApplicant has served as a translator and as a cultural liaison between \nAmericans and Iraqi citizens, diffusing tensions and facilitating transactions between the \ntwo groups. . . . . Applicant put his life in danger on at least one occasion to protect \nAmerican lives and interests in Afghanistan.\u201d). \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Saudi Arabia must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers there.5  Terrorists continue to threaten Saudi Arabia, \nand the interests of the United States, U.S. Armed Forces, and those who cooperate \nand assist the United States. The United States and Saudi Arabia are allies in the war \non terrorism.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 58, is married and has one adult child. She obtained her undergraduate degree in 2007. She also has a master\u2019s in theology and other certifications. Applicant completed her security clearance application (SCA) on September 29, 2015. She has held a security clearance since 2004. (GE 1) She worked for her current employer since 2015. She previously worked as a contractor since 1998. (Tr. 18) The SOR alleges a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing in 2005 that was dismissed in 2005 when Applicant failed to complete required filings; a 2016 state tax lien in the amount of $7,308; a 2011 state tax lien in the amount of $13,132.00; a 2012 Federal tax lien in the amount of $41,313.00; a medical account in the amount of $560; and a 2014 eviction law suit. Applicant admitted the allegations relating to the financial allegations. The SOR alleged under personal conduct concerns three instances of falsification on her 2015 security clearance application.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 16, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the Government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 13, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on September 12, 2018.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nOctober 29, 2018, scheduling the hearing for December 6, 2018. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were \nadmitted. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthough E. The record was left open until December 20, 2018, and Applicant timely \n02/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nsubmitted a packet of documents, which was marked as AE F, and was accepted into the \nrecord without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December \n14, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 58, is married and has one adult child. She obtained her  \nundergraduate degree in 2007. She also has a master\u2019s in theology and other \ncertifications. Applicant completed her security clearance application (SCA) on \nSeptember 29, 2015. She has held a security clearance since 2004. (GE 1) She worked \nfor her current employer since 2015. She previously worked as a contractor since 1998. \n(Tr. 18) \n \nThe SOR alleges a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing in 2005 that was dismissed in \n2005 when Applicant failed to complete required filings; a 2016 state tax lien in the amount \nof $7,308; a 2011 state tax lien in the amount of $13,132.00; a 2012 Federal tax lien in \nthe amount of $41,313.00; a medical account in the amount of $560; and a 2014 eviction \nlaw suit. Applicant admitted the allegations relating to the financial allegations. The SOR \nalleged under personal conduct concerns three instances of falsification on her 2015 \nsecurity clearance application. Applicant denied the falsifications on the security \nclearance application and she provided explanations for her financial situation. \n \nFINANCIAL \n \nApplicant acknowledged her financial hardship, but reported unemployment from \nDecember 2014 to February 2015 and from July 2015 to September 2015. Applicant was \nself-employed from May 2007 to May 2009 and from October 2009 to December 2010. \n(GE 2) Applicant also referred to bad advice from an accountant regarding the filing of  \nher self-employment tax return. A final unemployment occurred when a contract ended in \nOctober 2017 until April 2018. (Tr. 47) \n \nApplicant suffered a stroke in the workplace, but did not have health insurance as \nshe was working as a 1099 employee and responsible for health insurance. She suffered \nsome short term memory loss as a result, and noted this to the OPM investigator when \nshe had neglected to provide certain dates. (GE 2) \n \nAs to SOR 1.a, Applicant admitted the bankruptcy filing (GE 9) and explained that \nher attorney advised her to file as there was a home contractor who was attempting to \ngarnish her wages and extract $68,000 from her for work that had not been done and for \nwhich she had no account. (Tr. 51) She was not aware of this until she was purchasing a \nhome and it appeared on her credit report. Her attorney asked for proof from the company \nthat Applicant owed $68,000 and nothing was forthcoming. The bankruptcy was \ndismissed. It has not appeared on her credit bureau report for some time and she has \ndiscussed this issue in previous investigations. The action is 12 years old. \n \nApplicant admitted that she was indebted for the state tax lien (SOR 1.b) in an \noriginal amount of $7,308. However, Applicant stated that there is only one account or \n\n \n3 \n \nlien for the state and the total is $13,132, which is the other state tax lien alleged in SOR \n1.c. She submitted a document from the state comptroller, dated March 2018 showing a \nbalance of $4,786.08 for tax year 2007 and a balance of $9,072.72 for tax year 2009. (AE \nA) Applicant explained that the tax was due to the inaccurate tax filing by her accountant.  \nApplicant was to file as an S corporation but the filing was for a C corporation. (Tr. 22) \nShe explained that in 2011, she began paying $400 a month, but it was not clear from the \nrecord that the payment was going to the IRS. At one point, she received the checks back. \nThey had been torn in half. In 2018, Applicant contacted the state comptroller\u2019s office and \nexplained her \u201csituation.\u201d Applicant reached an agreement for a payment plan for a term \nof 60 months with a down payment of $1,374 and monthly payments of $235. She stated \nthat the tax year 2008 had been paid in full. Applicant has not started making any \npayments and stated that her husband had a massive heart attack and she is the only \none employed. (Tr. 25) \n \nAs to SOR 1.d, a 2012 Federal tax lien in the amount of $41,313, Applicant made \nan offer in compromise for $2,400, which was accepted. She made monthly payments of \n$100. Applicant presented a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien (AE B) and a letter \nfrom the IRS, dated 2013 that the final payment was made by credit card and that all \npayments had been made. (AE B) \n \nAs to SOR 1.e, a medical account in the amount of $560, Applicant stated that she \nhas been making payments to a creditor monthly in the amount of $87. However, there is \nno record of any payments made to the account. As a post-hearing submission, Applicant \nprovided a receipt for $480, but it was not clear to whom it was paid. (AE F) \n \nApplicant explained that the law suit situation which resulted in allegation SOR 1.f, \nis due to a flood that occurred above her apartment in May 2014, when her dining room  \nfilled with scalding water from the roof. She called maintenance and after about 20 \nminutes a technician. The technician was unsuccessful in stopping the water and he \ncalled the supervisor. It took another 20 minutes to turn the water off in the above \napartment. This left her apartment uninhabitable and she checked into a hotel. (AE C) \nManagement asked Applicant to move all her belongings out so that the apartment could \nbe renovated. When Applicant asked to be reimbursed for her May rent and expenses \npaid for the hotel night, she was told no. Applicant moved things as fast as she could. \nBefore she was finished a notice of eviction was placed on her door. She was charged \nfor various repairs for which she paid. \n \n Applicant volunteered that she filed for an extension for her 2017 Federal tax \nreturn. (Tr. 59) It has been filed and she owes about $8,000. She stated that she believes \nshe also owes states tax for 2017. (Tr. 60) She testified that this was due to the old \naccountant that she had a problem with concerning the S versus C corporation,  i.e,  filing \nthe wrong tax returns during her self-employment in 2008.  She has a new accountant.  \n \nPERSONAL CONDUCT \n \nWhen Applicant completed her 2015 SCA, she answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 26 \nconcerning liens against your property or failure to pay taxes in the past seven years. She \n\n \n4 \n \nalso answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 26 concerning bills or debts turned over to collection \naccounts. Also, Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to Section 28 regarding non-criminal court \nactions in the last ten years. \n \nApplicant denied that she intentionally falsified her 2015 SCA. In her answer, she \nstated that she did not have a lien placed against her property for failure to pay taxes.  \nShe stated that she did not become a home owner until 2015 and the taxes owed were \npaid in 2013.  She testified that she answered all questions to the best of her ability and \nas for being a party to a law suit regarding the apartment, the amount of money was paid \nand she did not regard this as being a party to a law suit. She realized at the hearing that \nshe answered incorrectly. (Tr. 35)  She was adamant that she did not believe the medical \naccount was in collection because it was due and owing to a hospital. (Tr. 36)  She \ntestified at the hearing that she had liens (both state and federal) but they had been \nresolved in years prior.  Applicant stated that she kept no information from the investigator \nduring her interview. (Tr.45) She reiterated that she was completely open and honest with \nthe Government when she answered the questions.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u2026.failure to \npay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required\u201d).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \n\n \n6 \n \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy occurred in 2005, and is an isolated event. She \nexperienced unemployment on various occasions and suffered a stroke. Her husband \nsuffered a heart attack. She also received some bad advice from an accountant. These \nevents were beyond her control. She also had flooding in her apartment as a result of a \nflood from an apartment above. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has significant \ntax issues, an unpaid medical debt, and 2017 Federal tax due in the amount of about \n$8,000.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. While Applicant\u2019s unemployment, stroke and other \nhealth issues were beyond her control, she has not acted responsibly to address the \nresulting debts. She has not produced sufficient information to show that she has been \nproactive in her actions. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not receive any financial \ncounseling nor are there clear indications that her financial situation is under control. She \nhas settled a Federal tax lien but has not started payments on other liens. She did not \nsubmit proof or documentation about her medical account. Her current ability to pay her \ndelinquent debts and taxes is in doubt. Her financial problems are not under control.  \n \nApplicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n\n \n7 \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of her SCA, the following \ndisqualifying condition could apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that she falsified her 2015 SCA, in her answer, and in her remarks \nat the hearing, she was adamant that she was not trying to defraud the Government.  She \npaid a Federal tax lien and did not understand the question about a lien on property. She \nanswered to the best of her ability. In fact, she had denied those allegations on the SOR. \nAn omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission.1 An applicant\u2019s level of education and business experience are \nrelevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on an SCA was \ndeliberate.2  \n \nIn this instance, it is clear from Applicant\u2019s comments that she was not aware of \nthe intent of the questions. At the hearing, she agreed that she answered inaccurately \nwhen the questions were explained. She should have disclosed the delinquent debts she \nhad knowledge of on her SCA. However, I find insubstantial evidence of an intent by \nApplicant to intentionally omit, conceal, or falsify facts from and on her SCA. Therefore, \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. \n                                                          \n1 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant made prompt or good-faith efforts to correct any misleading or false \ninformation when she spoke openly to the investigator during her interview. Applicant was \ncredible and has shown that similar lapses in judgment are unlikely to recur. She provided \nsufficient information in this record to demonstrate that she has met her burden of proof \nfor her personal conduct. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, including her credibility and openness at the hearing, I \nconclude that Applicant did not deliberately falsify her SCA, but she has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by her financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not \ncarried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nher eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

The credit bureau reports indicate that by September 2015, \nhe accumulated $15,673 in child support arrears for one of his daughters. In early 2018, \nhe demonstrated good judgment by hiring an attorney to address the support arrears \nissues. However, instead of applying more of his earnings to resolve the arrears issue, \nhe exercised poor judgment by purchasing a vehicle in December 2017 and a \nmotorcycle in May 2018. Eligibility for security clearance access is denied.   \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 2, 2015, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the \naffirmative findings required to continue a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 5, 2017, detailing security concerns raised by \n\n \n  2 \n \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order \n(E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on September 1, 2006. \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence \nissued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs). The guidelines are applicable to all individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to \nhold a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the September 1, 2006 AGs and are \neffective on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility under the new AGs.1 \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on May 26, 2017. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 23, 2018, for a \nhearing on November 15, 2018. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s \nthree exhibits (GE) 1-3 and Applicant\u2019s nine exhibits (AE) A-I were entered into \nevidence without objection. The record remained open until November 30, 2018, to \nallow Applicant to submit additional documentation regarding his budget. No \nsupplemental documentation was received. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non November 26, 2018. The record closed on November 30, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes delinquent child support of $15,673 (SOR \n1.a). The account was placed in collection in In September 2015. Applicant admitted the \nallegation. (GE 2 at 1; Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR) \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He married in 2004 and divorced in 2012. He has five \nchildren, two 17-year-old daughters, and three sons, ages 17, 4, and 1 year. Applicant \nserved on active duty in the United States (U.S.) Army from July 1999 until his \nhonorable discharge in March 2008. He attended vocational school from March 2008 for \nsix years. In 2014, Applicant began taking course material for a bachelor\u2019s degree in \ncybersecurity, but withdrew to begin course work to earn information technology (IT) \ncertifications. In March 2018, he began online course work towards a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin science, with an ultimate goal of obtaining a master\u2019s degree in IT. (GE 1 at 13, 27, \n30; Tr. 7-15) \n \nAfter his discharge from the U.S. Army in March 2008, Applicant worked in \ndefense contractor positions and in federal employment positions. He worked as a \n                                            \n1 My decision in this case would be the same under the 2006 or 2017 guidelines. \n  \n\n \n  3 \n \nmaterial coordinator, a supply technician, an account manager, a quality safety \nmanager, and a management and program analyst. In 2015, Applicant worked in his \nfirst cyber security position. He was employed at a help desk from 2016 until June 2018, \nwhen the contract ended resulting in his unemployment. He is still unemployed. He \ncurrently has a sponsor. His previous periods of unemployment were March to June \n2008, March to May 2012. September to November 2012, and July to September 2013. \nHe has held a security clearance since 1999. (GE 1 at 13-33; Tr. 10-15, 33-34)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s first daughter was born in 2002 and she is 17 years old. In January \n2003, a child support court order for this daughter began in state X. The child support \npayments were $289 a month; the support order increased to $350 a month in October \n2008. Applicant claims that he began having difficulty paying the support after he was \ndischarged from the Army in 2008. Because of joint marital accounts related to the \nmarriage (2004 to 2012) and lawyer fees related to the divorce, he could only pay some \nbut not all the monthly child support. He initially filed for separation from his former wife \nin state X, but after he moved to state Y, he had to refile for separation. (Tr. 37-39) \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s first daughter came to live with him in June 2016, his child \nsupport should have been modified downward but it was not. In October 2016, the first \ndaughter was removed from Applicant\u2019s home because of allegations of sexual abuse \nagainst Applicant that were found to be totally groundless. The first daughter was \nrelocated to her grandmother\u2019s residence, but after residing there for three to four \nmonths, she ran away. The daughter was placed in an outplacement program at a \nboarding school in July 2018 and was to move back with Applicant in December 2018, \nwhen she was discharged from the program. (Tr. 44-45, 53-55) \n \nApplicant\u2019s child support payment ledger for January 2003 through May 11, 2017 \n(child support for first daughter) indicates that his payment record to the county child \nsupport office of state X was neither regular in amount nor frequency. That is probably \nwhy his child support arrears ($35) started accruing immediately when his support \npayments increased from $289 to $350 a month in October 2008. On March 30, 2017, \nthe state Y division of child support enforcement (DCSE), the state where he currently \nresides, informed him by letter that he owed $15,673 in past-due child support and \nthreatened to suspend his driver\u2019s license because his past-due child support was over \n$5,000 or was past due by 90 days or more. (AE A; AE F) \n \nWhen Applicant received the letter In March 2017 from state Y claiming he owed \nchild support arrears of $15,673 to state X (division of child support), he began to \ninvestigate why the arrearage was so high. In June 2017, he was informed by letter \nfrom the state Y division of child support enforcement (DCSE) that because of the \nexistence of an out-of-state support order for the first daughter living with him in state Y \nduring the period, and an in-state child support order for the second daughter residing in \nstate X, the wage garnishment payments were \u201csplitting\u201d and neither mother was \nreceiving the correct support due. Instead, they were receiving partial instead of full \nsupport payments from state X child support office, which increased Applicant\u2019s arrears. \n\n \n  4 \n \nNo additional information was provided. Applicant hired an attorney in May 2018 and an \naudit was conducted of his entire child support payment history for the first daughter. On \nNovember 8, 2018, his attorney notified him that his child support hearing had just been \nheld that day. The court found that his child support obligation (SOR 1.a) was \nsuspended retroactive to March 2018. Applicant still owed arrears of $6,794 to the \nmother of the SOR 1.a child support recipient, to be repaid at $30 a month. Applicant\u2019s \narrears owed to the child support recipient\u2019s grandmother was $4,114, to be repaid at \n$200 a month. Though Applicant had not received a court order that memorialized the \nfindings, he informed the judge that he would start making payments on December 1, \n2018, to the mother and grandmother. (AE A; AE B; AE D; AD E; Tr. 43-46) \n \n \nApplicant has a second 17-year-old daughter whose child support order \n(unalleged) was also implemented in January 2003. The terms of the support order are \nthe same as for the daughter in the preceding paragraph. Applicant claimed that he is \nregularly paying child support of $350 and $35 toward the arrearage on a monthly basis. \nThe arrearage amount, about $10,000, is not alleged in the SOR. Also unalleged in the \nSOR are Applicant\u2019s unofficial child support payments for his three sons: about $350 a \nmonth for his 17-year-old son; about $350 a month for his 4-year-old son; and about \n$200 a month for his one-year-old son. (Tr. 40-42, 52, 57) I will consider this unalleged \nevidence in evaluating Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation or changed circumstances, and in \napplying the factors of the whole-person concept.  \n \nApplicant receives a partial disability pay from the U.S. Army and is financing his \neducation from his military benefits. He lives by himself in an apartment that that he \nrents for $1,100 a month. He has two cars; one is for commuting; the other is used for \ntransporting his children in the local area and when he travels to state X to visit his \nchildren. He purchased one car in September 2016 and one car in December 2017. He \npays a total of $973 a month for both cars. He pays a total of $100 a month for two \nmotorcycles. He does not remember when he purchased one of the motorcycles, but he \nremembered it cost between $3,000 and $4,000. He purchased the other motorcycle in \nMay 2018 for $5,000. He uses one of the motorcycles for the track and the other is for \nleisure riding. Applicant has a total of $3,000 in his checking and saving accounts. He \nhas about $500 in stock. He participated in financial counseling in September 2018 to \nremove the collection items that were negatively affecting his credit score. (Tr. 46-61) \n \nIn March 2018, Applicant opened a limited liability cybersecurity company and \nseeks to qualify for a facility security clearance so he can start bidding on contracts. He \nis trying to obtain his small business certification, minority-owned certification, and a \nservice veteran certification. (Tr. 71-73) \n \nTo manage his earnings and expenditures, Applicant utilizes a budget with the \nhelp of a computer software program. He testified that he wanted an opportunity to \nsubmit evidence of a budget. The record remained open until November 30, 2018, but \nno post-hearing evidence was received. (Tr. 49, 62-63) \n \n\n \n  5 \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nA person with access to classified information occupies a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated on good judgment, trust and confidence. A person who \ndisplays financial irresponsibility may also be irresponsible or negligent in safeguarding \nclassified information at all times and in all places.  \n \n\n \n  6 \n \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that could raise a security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of not paying his child support for his first daughter. \nHis child support records from the state X division of child support show that his child \nsupport payments were irregular. At the time his child support payments increased to \n$350 monthly by court order in October 2008, he was immediately assessed arrears. By \nSeptember 2015, his child support arrears for the SOR 1.a daughter was $15,673. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b620 include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts \n \nAfter receiving a letter from DCSE of state Y in March 2017 advising him that he \nowed past due child support totaling $15,673, and indicating that his driver\u2019s license \ncould be suspended unless he took action on the child support issue, in May 2018, \nApplicant retained an attorney to file a motion to redirect support payments and \ndetermine child support arrears. In November 2018, his attorney advised him that after \nthe hearing, the court determined that he no longer owed child support and his arrears \nwere reduced to $6,795. The mitigation Applicant receives under AG \u00b6 20(a) is reduced \nby his failure to act much sooner to rectify the arrears problem. Mitigation under the \ncondition is reduced even more because of the absence of documented evidence to \n\n \n  7 \n \nsupport Applicant\u2019s testimonial claim of owing only child support arrears for his second \ndaughter.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) recognizes events that result in financial problems beyond the \nperson\u2019s control. Applicant\u2019s brief periods of unemployment were events beyond his \ncontrol. The improper calculations by the state X division of child support concerning his \nfirst daughter was an additional event beyond his control. However, AG \u00b6 20(b) has \nlimited application because Applicant has not demonstrated he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Instead of being more proactive in directing a larger part of his \nearnings to his child support and support arrears of his two oldest daughters, he \npurchased two cars in September 2016 and December 2017. He purchased his second \nmotorcycle in May 2018. On balance, AG \u00b6 20(b) has only limited application to the \ncircumstances of this case.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) address steps an applicant has taken to bring his debts \nunder control. Though Applicant contended that he received financial counseling in \nSeptember 2018, the service was directed more toward eliminating collection items from \nhis credit report. He claimed he had a budget to track his finances, yet, he declined to \npresent evidence of a budget. While he appears to be gaining control over the arrears \nfor his first daughter, there is no documented evidence to indicate that his second \ndaughter\u2019s arrears issues are being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable \nin part. The limited application of AG \u00b6 20(d) is dramatically diminished by Applicant\u2019s \nsporadic child support payment record since 2003.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial \nconsiderations) in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old mature adult, who is divorced with five children. He \nwas honorably discharged from the U.S. Army in March 2008. He is taking courses to \n\n \n  8 \n \ncomplete a bachelor\u2019s in science degree and hopes to obtain a master\u2019s degree in IT. I \nconsidered that Applicant\u2019s child support arrears for his first daughter were much less in \nNovember 2018 than originally posted in the March 2017 letter from DCSE of state Y \nand the SOR. However, Applicant provided no documentation concerning the status of \nthe child support issues for his second daughter. Even though he has known for a long \ntime that he owed child support arrears for both daughters, he used extremely poor \njudgment and irresponsibility in purchasing a vehicle in December 2017 and a \nmotorcycle in May 2018. Considering the evidence as a whole, Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the guideline for financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n07/23/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems, which is ongoing. He has not taken any substantial affirmative action \nto resolve more than $50,000 in delinquent debt. Accordingly, this case is decided \nagainst Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non March 31, 2016. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on June 26, 2017, after reviewing the application and \nthe information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \n\n \n2 \n \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 21, 2017. He provided handwritten \nresponses on the SOR. His answers to the SOR allegations were mixed, with \nadmissions and denials. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to another judge on September 19, 2017. The hearing \nscheduled for September 28, 2017, was cancelled. The case was reassigned to me on \nMay 22, 2018. The hearing took place as scheduled on September 19, 2018. Applicant \nappeared without counsel. Department Counsel offered documentary exhibits, which \nwere admitted as Exhibits 1-8. Applicant did not offer any documentary exhibits, he \ncalled no witnesses, and he relied on his own testimony. The hearing transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on September 27, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance. He is employed as a custodian for a company in the defense industry. He \nhas been so employed since 2016. He was initially hired at an hourly rate of $11.00, \nand he now earns $13.67 per hour. His formal education consists of a high school \ndiploma and a certificate in automotive repair or maintenance from a technical institute \nawarded in 1984. He married in 2013, and he has no children. His spouse works as an \nadministrative assistant for a community college. Applicant is unaware of her income; \nthey handle their money separately; and they share living expenses.  \n \nBefore his current employment, Applicant worked full-time as a carpet technician \nfor a casino during 2014-2016. Before that, he worked full-time as a security guard for \ntwo different companies during 2008-2014. Before that, he worked full-time as a \ncustodian for a federal contractor during 1999-2008. His employment history does not \ninclude service in the U.S. armed forces.   \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of about $5,000 in \nback taxes owed to the IRS for multiple tax years and 22 delinquent accounts totaling \nmore than $50,000. Concerning the delinquent accounts, they include 13 collection \naccounts, 7 charged-off accounts, and 2 unpaid judgments for a total of about $56,152. \nTwo of the 13 collection accounts are medical collection accounts for about $1,687 in \ntotal. In addition to his admissions in his answers to the SOR and during the hearing, \nthe delinquent accounts are established by credit reports from 2016, 2017, and 2018. \n(Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7). He explained that he incurred the large amount of \nindebtedness because he had too many credit cards. (Tr. 37) At the hearing, it was \nestablished that the $453 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.t was paid. (Tr. 45-46) \nLikewise, it was established that the $154 medical collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.x was \nnot supported by the documentary evidence. (Tr. 48) Otherwise, Applicant did not \npresent any reliable documentation to establish that any of other 20 delinquent debts \nwere paid, settled, in a repayment arrangement, in dispute, forgiven, cancelled, or \notherwise resolved. I find that those 20 delinquent accounts in the SOR are unresolved. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nConcerning the tax matters, Applicant admitted owing back taxes to the IRS for \ntax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 in amounts of $2,708, $1,932, and $306, respectively. \nHe explained that he incurred the tax debt because he did not have enough tax withheld \nfrom his paycheck. (Tr. 31) He has been repaying the IRS in an installment agreement \nsince at least 2016. (Exhibit 3) A November 2016 monthly notice from the IRS showed \nthat he was required to make a $150 monthly payment and that he owed $132 for tax \nyear 2011, $2,708 for 2013, $1,932 for 2014, and $360 for 2015. (Exhibit 3) A May 2017 \nmonthly notice from the IRS showed that he was required to make a $150 monthly \npayment and that he owed $2,890 for tax year 2013, $1,462 for 2014, and $381 for \n2015. (Exhibit 2) He did not present more up-to-date documentation from the IRS at the \nhearing. He stated he is paying $180 monthly on the installment agreement, and he \nestimated owing a total of about $1,899. (Tr. 31-34) He stated that refunds for tax years \n2016 and 2017 were withheld by the IRS for payment of the back taxes. (Tr. 35) He \nthinks he owes back taxes to the state tax authority, but he did not have much detail on \nthe subject. (Tr. 34)  \n \nApplicant has a checking account with a balance of about $899, but does not \nhave a savings account. (Tr. 50) He had no financial assets other than a 401(k) account \nwith his current employer with a balance of about $7,000. (Tr. 50-51) He estimated his \nannual gross income at about $32,000. (Tr. 37)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required;  \n                                                          \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. His problematic \nfinancial history is likely traceable to financial irresponsibility and neglect. He used credit \ncards to spend more than he could repay, and he did not stay current with his federal \ntax obligations. The disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nConcerning the remaining delinquent accounts for more than $50,000, what is \nmissing here is obvious; namely, Applicant failed to take any substantial affirmative \naction (\u201ca good-faith effort\u201d) to resolve the indebtedness. He owes more in delinquent \ndebt than he earns on an annual basis, and he has little in the way of financial assets. \nHe does not have a realistic plan in place to resolve the indebtedness. It is unlikely that \nhe will repay those debts in the foreseeable future, if ever. Given the level of his assets \nand liabilities, his best course of action may be to seek relief in bankruptcy court.  \n \n \nIt does appear that Applicant has made some progress on the federal income tax \nmatters. There is some documentation from 2016 and 2017 to establish that he has \nmade payments under an installment agreement with the IRS. But again, what is \nmissing here is obvious; namely, current documentation showing his adherence to the \nagreement. Given the lack of current documentation, I cannot conclude that he is in \ncompliance with the IRS installment agreement.   \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has not met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.s:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.u -- 1.w:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 29, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on November \n15, 2017. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on January 9, 2018, scheduling the hearing for January 23, 2018. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 4, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record \nwas left open for two months until March 23, 2018, for receipt of additional \ndocumentation.  Applicant presented one set of documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n2 \n \nExhibits (AppX) A, and admitted into evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (TR) on January 31, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the two allegations in SOR: \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 14.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since July of 2016. (GX 1 \nat pages 14~15.) He is unmarried, and has no children. (GX 1 at pages 24~25.) \nApplicant attributes his admitted financial difficulties to periods of unemployment. (TR at \npage 12 line 24 to page 17 line 6.) \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. Applicant has failed to file, as required, Federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2011~2013 and for 2016. (TR at page 20 line 10 to page 28 line 13.) He attributes \nhis failure to file due to periods of overseas deployment while in the Air Force, and to \nsimple procrastination. (Id, and GX 1 at pages 18~19.) Applicant has submitted \ndocumentation showing his filing for tax year 2014 (AppX A), and he had no income in \n2015 as he was unemployed (GX 1 at page 15). Despite having two months to do so, \nhowever, Applicant submitted nothing showing he has filed for tax years 2011~2013 and \nfor 2016; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of \nabout $3,783. (TR at page 17 line 3 to page 19 line 13, and at page 28 line 13.) Despite \nhaving two months to do so, Applicant submitted nothing showing he has addressed \nthis admitted debt; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n3 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant has failed to file his Federal tax returns, and has significant past-due \ndebt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n\n \n5 \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s failure to file several years of tax returns is \nongoing. He also has significant delinquencies. Guideline F is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 7, 2015. On \nJune 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 24, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \n02/25/2019\n\n2 \n \ncase on September 24, 2018. In her submission, Department Counsel amended the SOR \nby withdrawing SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f. On September 25, 2018, a complete copy of the file \nof relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. He received the FORM on November 15, 2018, and did not respond. The case \nwas assigned to me on February 12, 2019.  \n \nThe FORM included summaries of personal subject interviews (PSI) conducted on \nJuly 13, August 25, September 27, October 28, November 18, and December 29, 2016 \n(FORM Item 10). The PSI summaries were not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to comment on the \naccuracy of the PSI summaries; make any corrections, additions, deletions or updates; \nor object to consideration of the PSI summaries on the ground that they were not \nauthenticated. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summaries by failing \nto respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, \nthey are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the \nDirective.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd.

He left his job as a federal contractor in 2013, because \nhe had not completed required training. (FORM Item 10 at 3.) He has worked \nintermittently as an independent contractor since April 1998. When he has a full-time job, \nhe works as an independent contractor on weekends. (FORM Item 10 at 2.) \n \n \nApplicant is a high school graduate. He has never married and has no children. He \nhas held a security clearance since at least November 1998 (FORM Item 10 at 5.)  \n \n \nThe SOR, as amended, alleges six delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from \nApril 2015 (FORM Item 9), February 2017 (FORM Item 7), and September 2018 (FORM \nItem 6). The evidence concerning these delinquent debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: mortgage loan past due for $16,834, in foreclosure with balance \nof $271,350. Applicant submitted no documentary evidence of the status of this debt. The \nSeptember 2018 credit report reflects that the last payment on this debt was in July 2017. \nIt is not resolved. \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (FORM Item 5) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: home-improvement loan charged off for $33,381. In his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant stated that he had an agreement to pay $50 per month on this \naccount. The September 2018 credit report reflects that the last payment on this debt was \nin August 2017. He did not provide any documentary evidence of a payment agreement \nor payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-card account charged off for $10,327. In his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant stated that he had a payment agreement providing for monthly $195 \npayments. The September 2018 credit report reflects that the last payment on this debt \nwas in July 2017. He did not provide any documentary evidence of a payment agreement \nor payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: withdrawn. This debt was resolved before Applicant submitted his \nanswer to the SOR. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: judgment filed in 2016 for $7,962. This debt is for delinquent taxes. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that his \u201ctax person\u201d is working to resolve or \nset up a payment agreement for this debt. It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: withdrawn. This debt is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: debt to local government, placed for collection of $180. In his \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he thought that this debt was a traffic ticket. In \nthe August 2016 PSI, he stated that it was a delinquent utility bill. (FORM Item 10 at 6.) It \nis not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: debt to fitness club, placed for collection of $125. In his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant stated the collection account was closed and returned to the original \ncreditor. He did not provide any documentary evidence showing that the debt is resolved. \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he answered \u201cno\u201d to all questions asking \nwhether he had any financial delinquencies. He did not disclose any of the delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that all debts reflected in \nhis credit report were paid off before he purchased his home and that, if he had any recent \ndelinquent debts, he must have misread the question due to haste in completing the SCA. \nThe credit reports reflect that his mortgage loan was opened in April 2016, about a year \nafter he submitted his SCA. (FORM Item 6 at 2; FORM Item 7 at 1.)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted his SCA on April 7, 2015. The credit report from April 21, 2015 \nreflected five delinquent debts: (1) a credit card that was past due for $1,365, on which \nthe last activity was in October 2013; (2) a telecommunications account that was past due \nfor $564, on which the last activity was in January 2014; (3) a telecommunications account \nthat was past due for $238, on which the last activity was in October 2013; (4) a delinquent \ntraffic ticket for $180, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g; and (5) a delinquent $125 debt to a fitness \nclub, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h.  \n \n\n4 \n \n \nWhen Applicant was confronted with these debts during the August 2016 PSI, he \ntold an investigator that he did not list these debts in his SCA because he paid the $238 \ntelecommunication bill in December 2015 and paid the other debts on specific dates he \ncould not recall in 2015. (FORM Item 10 at 6-7.) The credit reports from February 2017 \nand September 2018 reflected that the delinquent credit-card account and one of the two \ndelinquent telecommunications accounts had been paid at some time after the April 2015 \ncredit report was issued, but the $564 telecommunications account and the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h were not resolved. (FORM Item 7 at 2.)  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to inadequate self-employment income \nwhen he was not employed full time between mid-2013 and April 2015. (FORM Item 10 \nat 9.) He has not provided any specific information about his income and expenses during \nhis period of unemployment, nor has he provided any specific information about his \nincome and expenses since he began his current job in April 2015. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n\n5 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d); and \n\n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nare recent, numerous, and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. The record does not reflect whether Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to complete the training that was required for his continued employment in mid-\n2013 was a condition largely beyond his control. Even if it was beyond his control, he has \nnot acted responsibly. He resolved several delinquent debts after he submitted his SCA, \napparently because the debts were impediments to qualifying for a mortgage loan. He \nhas been employed full time for almost four years, but he produced no documentary \nevidence of significant actions to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 1.g, \nand 1.h.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n\n7 \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n \nBased on the limited record, I am satisfied that Applicant knew he had delinquent \ndebts when he submitted his SCA. His resolution of some of the debts shortly after \nsubmitting his SCA suggests that he did not list them in his SCA because he hoped to be \nable to pay them before they became a security-clearance issue. His resolution of the \ntelecommunication bill in December 2015 reflects this state of mind at the time he \nsubmitted his SCA. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant made no effort to correct the \nomissions in his SCA until he was confronted with them during the August 2016 PSI. His \nfalsification is arguably infrequent, but it is recent and it is not \u201cminor.\u201d Falsification of a \nsecurity clearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \n\n8 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and falsification of \nhis SCA. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.f: \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: pro se  \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny his \neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant, a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen from Senegal, does not have a foreign preference for France. \nEven though he maintains ties to Senegal and France, he has shown that he will \nresolve any potential conflicts of interest in favor of the United States. Clearance is \ngranted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 24, 2017, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the foreign influence and foreign preference guidelines.1 DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether to revoke or deny \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \n1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017.   \n02/21/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a decision on the written \nrecord. However, after receiving a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated \nApril 2, 2018, he requested that his case be converted to a hearing.2 On May 22, 2018, \nDepartment Counsel fulfilled the Government\u2019s discovery obligation, confirming \nApplicant\u2019s receipt of the documents the Government intended to offer in its case \nagainst him that were appended to the FORM.3 At the hearing, convened on November \n1, 2018, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A \nthrough C, without objection.  I received the transcript (Tr.) on November 9, 2018. On \nNovember 16, 2018, I recommended this case for summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor; however, the Government objected without explanation.4  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nregarding the Republic of Senegal. Without objection from Applicant, I approved the \nrequest and the document is appended to the record as HE III.5  \n \nOn January 18, 2019, I sent the parties an email, indicating that I intended to \ntake administrative notice of facts regarding the Republic of Senegal, the Republic of \nFrance, its nationality laws, and its historical relationship with Senegal from the U.S. \nDepartment of State, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Government of the \nRepublic of France. The parties did not object, and the email and the documents are \nappended to the record as HE V through X.6 \n \nDepartment Counsel requested permission to submit additional administrative \nnotice documents in response to those I identified.  In a submission dated, February 8, \n2019,7 Department Counsel requested that I take \u201csimple notice . . . of the adjudicative \nfact that embassies are very frequently subject to deadly attacks.\u201d In support of the \nproposition, Department Counsel offered: a Wikipedia list of the attacks on diplomatic \nmissions around the world between 1829 and 2018; a Wikipedia article detailing the \n1974 attack on the French Embassy at The Hague; an excerpt of a February 2018 \narticle from the French news organization, French 24, regarding attacks on French \nembassies in Africa since 2000; and an article from Voice of America News regarding a \n                                                          \n2 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. \n \n3 HE II.  \n \n4 HE IV.  \n \n5 HE III: U.S. Department of State: Diplomacy in Action \u2013 Senegal, December 2009 \n \n6 The facts that I have taken administrative notice are from the following sources: HE V: Central \nIntelligence Agency: The World Factbook \u2013 Senegal; HE VI: U.S. Department of State: Country Reports \non Terrorism 2017; HE VII: Central Intelligence Agency: The World Factbook \u2013 France; and, HE VIII: U.S. \nDepartment of State: U.S. Relations with France. \n \n7  HE XI \n\n \n3 \n \nMarch 2018 attack on the French embassy in Burkina Faso. Applicant responded to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request as well as the proposed documents, and his comments \nare construed an an objection to their consideration. By its very nature an adjudicative \nfact is adduced from the record after the adversarial presentation of evidence and is not \nappropriate for administrative notice. Setting aside the adjudicative fact offered by \nDepartment Counsel, the supporting \ndocuments are also inappropriate for \nadministrative notice. The documents neither set forth nor are appropriate sources of \nlegislative facts - those necessary to understand a principal of law and not subject to \nevidentiary proof (e.g. official pronouncements of the President, State Department, \nDepartment of Defense, or other appropriate federal agencies on matters of national \nsecurity).8 However, the documents are appropriate for consideration as Government\u2019s \nExhibits, and will be admitted to the record as GE 3 through 6, over Applicant\u2019s \nobjection. I will consider each document and give it the appropriate weight. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 42, has worked as a senior associate for a federal contracting \ncompany since February 2015. He completed a security clearance application, his first, \nin March 2015, disclosing his family members and financial interests in Senegal as well \nas family members in France. He also disclosed part-time employment at the French \nEmbassy in the United States between 1999 and 2015.

Senegal maintains a well-trained military that receives most of its \ntraining, equipment, and support from the United States and France, with whom \nSenegal maintains close and favorable relationships. The country has historically taken \nan active role in United Nations peacekeeping efforts throughout Africa.11  \n                                                          \n8 See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4, FN 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007). \n \n9 GE 1.  \n \n10 GE 1; HE III, HE V. \n \n11 HE III.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAccording to the most recent Country Report on Terrorism published by the U.S. \nState Department, Senegal did not experience any terror attacks in 2017. However, the \nSenegalese government arrested two individuals with suspected ties to the Islamic \nState. The Government of Senegal works closely with U.S. military and law enforcement \nofficials to strengthen its counterterrorism capabilities. The risk of terrorist activity in \nSenegal arises from external and internal factors. Externally, transnational threats arose \ndue to the Senegalese military presence in several theaters of operation in the region \nand the activities of terrorist groups in neighboring countries. Internally, the promotion of \nfundamentalist ideologies by a small number of religious leaders constituted the chief \nconcern, however, these ideologies are outside the Islamic norms that predominate in \nSenegal.12 \n \nThe Republic of France is comprised of metropolitan France and the following \nterritories: French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion. Historically, \nFrance and the United States have maintained a friendly and active relationship. The \ntwo countries share common values and have parallel polices on most political, \neconomic, and security issues. The United States and France work closely on many \nissues, including counterterrorism, efforts to end the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and on regional problems around the world.13  \n \n \nApplicant lived in Senegal with his family until his father, a now retired member of \nthe Senegalese Army, served his final tour of duty as a military attach\u00e9 at a Senegalese \nembassy between 1991 and his retirement in 1995. Applicant attended college in \nFrance from 1994 to 1998, graduating with a degree in economics. He immigrated to \nthe United States in 1999 after being awarded permanent resident status through the \ndiversity visa lottery program, which provides 55,000 permanent residents visas each \nyear to individuals from countries with a low rate of immigration to the United States.14 \nHe became a naturalized citizen in April 2005.15  \n \n \nUpon moving to the United States, Applicant entered graduate school and \nworked a series of low-paying jobs to support himself. In 1999, while visiting the French \nEmbassy to have documents translated, he saw a family friend. The friend informed \nApplicant about security positions available at the embassy. The position required \nApplicant to check identification for individuals entering the embassy, walk around the \nembassy to ensure employees left for the day, and answer after-hours phone calls from \nlocal law enforcement regarding issues with French nationals or French nationals \nneeding assistance with local enforcement. The position was not armed, as the grounds \nwere guarded by French police officers who responded to threats or suspicious \n                                                          \n12 HE VI.  \n \n13 HE VI \u2013 VIII.  \n \n14 See https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry.html \n \n15 GE 1; Tr. 19-21, 53-54. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nactivities. Applicant worked the security position part-time and attended graduate school \nfull-time between 1999 and 2002.16 \n \nHe continued the part-time position at the embassy when he began full-time \nemployment because he had grown accustomed to the busy schedule. The job was not \ndifficult, and it allowed him to accumulate savings. He reported the part-time job to each \nof his previous employers: an international bank (2003 to 2005); his current employer \n(2005 to 2013, and 2015 to present); and, an international management consulting firm \n(2013 to 2015). While completing the security clearance application, the nature of the \nquestions caused Applicant to become concerned that the part-time embassy positon \npresented a conflict of interest with having access to classified information. Around the \nsame time, the embassy considered changing the security officer role to an armed-\nguard position, which Applicant had no interest in pursuing. As a result, he resigned the \nembassy position. He ceased all ties with embassy contacts when he left the position in \n2015, including his contacts with a French police officer with whom he maintained a \ncasual friendship (SOR \u00b6 1.k).17 \n \nAside from taking advantage of the health benefits while he was a graduate \nstudent, Applicant received no other benefits from the French government during his \nemployment at the embassy. When he began working full-time in 2002, he relied on his \nemployer-offered health benefits. The embassy job did not provide Applicant a pathway \nto French citizenship. According to Applicant, the embassy treated him as a U.S. citizen, \nwhich impacted how the embassy compensated him in compliance with U.S. tax laws. \nHe paid income taxes only to the U.S. Government. The job neither created obligation \nbetween him and the French government, nor did it entitle him to receive benefits from \nthe French government.  The job did not require a security clearance or access to any \nsensitive or classified information.18  \n \n \nApplicant maintains ties to Senegal and France through his family members. His \nparents are residents and citizens of Senegal (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.b). His father, 81, no \nlonger works. After retiring from military service he briefly worked for a private \nuniversity. Applicant\u2019s mother, 73, also retired, worked as an educator. Both receive \ngovernment pensions and are financially self-sufficient. Applicant has seven siblings, \none of whom is deceased. His two oldest sisters (SOR \u00b6 1.c and 1.h), 55 and 50, \nrespectively, are residents and citizens of France. The oldest sister works as a \nconsultant, the other works as an administrator at a French financial institution. \nApplicant\u2019s two older brothers (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - 1.e), 48 and 46, respectively, are citizens \nof Senegal and residents of France. The older brother is a construction worker and the \nyounger brother is disabled and does not work. Applicant\u2019s two younger sisters (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.f and 1.g), are citizens of Senegal. The older of the two, who is 38, is a resident of \nFrance and works for a French bank. His youngest sister, 30, resides in Senegal and \n                                                          \n16 GE 1; Tr. 44-46, 49-50. \n \n17 GE 1; Tr. 35-36, 45-46. \n \n18 Tr. 48, 50-53. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nworks for a French mining company.19 Applicant also has one friend who is a citizen of \nFrance, residing in Senegal and is employed as an economist with the Senegalese \nMinistry of Finance. (SOR \u00b6 1.j).20 \n \n  \nApplicant owns property in Senegal: two parcels of land (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n) \nvalued at $14,000 (USD),  and a house (SOR \u00b6 1.o) valued at $115,000. He owns the \nproperties outright and they are managed by his youngest sister. The house is rented \nand generates approximately $600 in revenue each month. The proceeds are held in a \nSenegalese bank account (SOR \u00b6 1.l), which Applicant opened at a U.S. branch in \n2013. Applicant uses the money in the Senegalese bank account to pay for his parents\u2019 \npet projects, such as redecorating their home. He admits that in the past he has \nprovided them as much as $6,000 each year in financial support. Applicant does not \nprovide financial support to any other of his family members on a continuing basis, and \nhe does not rely on the income generated by the Senegalese properties for his ongoing \nfinancial maintenance.21  \n \n \nSince 2016, Applicant has lived and worked overseas. He is slated to continue in \nthis position until at least 2020, pending the resolution of his security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s annual compensation is approximately $200,000 and earns additional \nincome on the rental of his home while he works overseas. He has approximately \n$300,000 in retirement savings, and between $30,000 and $50,000 in stocks and other \ncash assets. He purchased his home in the United States in 2011 for approximately \n$306,000 and it is now valued at $450,000. He owes $100,000 on the mortgage loan \nand has $2,000 in other consumer debt.22  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n                                                          \n19 The SOR also alleges this sibling in SOR \u00b6 1.i. The duplicate allegation is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n20 GE 1; Tr. 25-35, 55-56. \n \n21 Tr. 36-41. \n \n22 AE A-C; Tr. 22-24, 42-44. \n\n \n7 \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites  \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nForeign Preference  \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the United States, then they may provide information or make decision that \nare harmful to the interests of the United States. Foreign involvement raises concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with \nU.S. national interests or when the individual acts to conceal it.  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s part-time employment as a security officer at \nthe French Embassy in the United States from 1999 to 2015 is evidence of Applicant\u2019s \nforeign preference for France over the United States. The Government argues that \nApplicant established a foreign preference when he chose to work for the French \nEmbassy over a U.S Government employer or enter the U.S. armed forces.23 However, \n                                                          \n23 Tr. 60.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nthe relevant disqualifying condition requires more to find a foreign preference. The \nrelevant Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(d) states that an \nApplicant acts in a way that indicates a foreign preference when he participates in \nforeign activities.  \n \nAlthough Applicant assumed employment with a foreign government, there is no \nevidence that the nature of the employment with France, a long-time ally, conflicted with \nU.S. interests. There is no evidence that the French Embassy, as suggested by the \nGovernment, is part of the \u201cstrong cultural heritage of embassies being associated with \nespionage.\u201d24 The position was not, as Department Counsel argues, akin to foreign \nmilitary service.25 The position did not make Applicant part of the French diplomatic \ncorps, armed forces, or even the armed police force responsible for the physical \nprotection of the embassy. Applicant did not swear an oath of allegiance to France. The \nposition did not provide a pathway to French citizenship, make Applicant eligible for any \nentitlements from the French government, or bestow upon him any rights or privileges of \nFrench citizenship or residency. He did not require a security clearance from the French \nGovernment, nor did the position expose him to any sensitive or classified information.  \n \nApplicant worked at the French Embassy in the United States because it \nfurthered his personal goals. Initially, he worked the part-time position because it \nprovided income and medical benefits while he attended graduate school full time \nbetween 1999 and 2002. He continued working the part-time job after earning his \ngraduate degree because it furthered his financial goals. However, when he believed \nthe job presented a potential conflict of interest with his current full-time position on a \nfederal contract, he resigned and ceased contacts with embassy employees. Also, his \nunwillingness to continue in the position if he was required carry a firearm is another \nindication that he did not have an allegiance or preference for France. Aside from \nmaintaining the part-time employment, Applicant has not acted in any other way to \ndemonstrate a foreign preference for France.  \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \n\u201c[F]oreign contacts and interests, including . . . business, financial and property \ninterests, are a national security concern if they result in a divided allegiance [or] . . . \nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d An assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign interest is located, including \nbut not limited to, consideration such as whether it is known target U.S. citizen to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information or associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s multiple ties to Senegal and France constitute \na possible foreign influence, in particular that his familial and financial ties to Senegal \nand his familial ties to France create a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign influence or \n                                                          \n24 Tr. 58-59, 61-62. \n \n25 Tr. 61. \n\n \n9 \n \nexploitation because of the respective foreign tie, contact, or interest. The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member \nliving under a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country, but it is \nnonetheless a relatively low standard. The nature and strength of the family ties or other \nforeign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in \nassessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk \nof coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the \nforeign government; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \nthe United States. In considering the nature of the foreign government, the \nadministrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the country at \nissue.26 Based on the available record, there is not a heightened risk associated with \neither country, which the Government seems to concede.27  \n \n \nHistorically, both countries maintain close ties to the United States. Neither \ncountry, nor non-governmental entities operating inside their borders, is known to \nmanipulate its citizens or ex-patriots to further their political or economic positions. \nNeither is known to be a state sponsor of terrorism. Although terrorist threats have \nbecome a greater concern in France in recent years, the United States and France have \nmaintained a favorable relationship, often working together on counterterrorism issues. \nSenegal, on the other hand, does not have history of terrorist groups operating within its \nborders, nor have U.S. interests operating in the country been a target of terrorist \norganizations.28  \n \n \nAlso, there is no heightened risk associated with Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s status as a \nretired military officer or Applicant\u2019s friend\u2019s position as an employee of the Senegalese \ngovernment as an economist. Applicant\u2019s father has been retired for 25 years and there \nis no evidence that he or Applicant maintains ongoing contact with any military or other \ngovernment officials, or that Applicant has used these contacts in a way that increases \nhis vulnerability to exploitation. Likewise, there is no evidence in the record to indicate \nthat Applicant\u2019s friend has a position or status that raises a concern.  \n \n \n \nWhile a heightened risk may not exist, his familial and financial ties to Senegal \nmay create a personal conflict of interest, or a conflict of interest between his obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology or the desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information or technology.29 However, this \nconcern is mitigated. None of his family members are currently employed by the \nSenegalese or French governments, or have positions in those societies that he will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between foreign interests and those of the \n                                                          \n26 See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \n \n27 Tr. 64. \n \n28 HE III, V \u2013 VIII. \n \n29 AG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \n\n \n10 \n \nUnited States.30 The SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s relationships with his friend employed by \nthe Senegalese government and a police officer at the French embassy. The former \nrelationship can be classified as casual and infrequent. The latter relationship no longer \nexists. The record does not contain any evidence that either relationship could serve as \na source of vulnerability.31 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Senegalese assets do not create a conflict of interest. The assets, \nvalued at $130,000 (USD), represents 20% of his net worth. He owns the properties \noutright and is not subject to influence by any foreign financial entities. Neither Applicant \nnor his foreign family members are financially dependent on the income generated by \nthe properties. Given these facts and the nature of the Senegalese government, it is \nunlikely that the assets will result in a conflict or effectively be used to influence, \nmanipulate, or pressure him. In comparison, Applicant has approximately $660,000 in \nU.S.-based assets, which include his home, retirement savings, and other financial \nassets. His debt, including his mortgage loan is approximately $102,000. He earns \nalmost $200,000 annually from his employment with a U.S.-based company. Given \nApplicant\u2019s choice to pursue U.S. citizenship and his significant financial ties to the \nUnited States, he is likely to resolve any conflict in favor of U.S. interests.32  \n \n \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect and \nhandle classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the \nwhole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although Applicant has strong ties to Senegal and \nsome familial ties to France, the record contains sufficient evidence to mitigate any \nforeign preference and foreign influence concerns. On his own, Applicant identified a \npotential conflict of interest between his full-time employment on a federal contract and \nhis part-time employment and resolved that conflict in favor or U.S. interests. In doing \nso, he has demonstrated that he takes the concerns and responsibilities of being a \nclearance holder seriously and that he can be expected to act in accordance with U.S. \ninterests in the future.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Preference  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Foreign Influence:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.p:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n                                                          \n30 AG 8(a).  \n \n31 AG \u00b6 8(c).  \n \n32 AG \u00b6 8(f).  \n\n \n11 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

He is married for the second time, but separated since about 2013. He does not have children. (Items 4, 5) Applicant has a history of financial problems. He apparently resolved the problems he had in the 2000s. He attributed his recent problems to his marital separation, medical issues, and a significant reduction in his salary.

The SOR also alleges a $5,756 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) to the same bank as the $7,406 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. I conclude these are duplicate allegations that allege the same debt. Applicant admitted owing all the non-duplicate debts, but he stated that he was paying some of the debts.

The SOR also alleges a $5,756 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) to the same bank as \nthe $7,406 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. I conclude these are duplicate allegations that \nallege the same debt. Applicant admitted owing all the non-duplicate debts, but he \nstated that he was paying some of the debts. (Item 2; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant contracted with a credit counseling company in about 2016 to assist \nhim in resolving his debts. The specifics of how long he was in the company\u2019s debt-\nmanagement plan and how much he paid are unavailable. However, when he \nresponded to the SOR in June 2017, he indicated that he had been paying debts \nthrough the plan for more than a year. (Item 2; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant indicated in his June 2017 response to the SOR that he planned to use \nhis income tax refund to pay his Department of Education student loans. It is unclear if \nanything was paid in 2017. However, in October 2018, the IRS withheld $10,752 from \nhis income tax refund and applied it to his student loans. The April 2019 credit report \nlisted the total balance of the four student loans as $9,756. In July 2019, the IRS \nwithheld another $8,675 from his income tax refund and applied it to his student loans. \n(Items 2, 7-10; AE A, C-E) \n \n \nApplicant started payments to the state for the $1,488 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i \nin 2017. He paid the debt in full in November 2017. (Items 2, 7-10; AE A, B) \n \n \nApplicant wrote in his June 2017 response to the SOR that he had been paying \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h through the debt-management plan for about a year. He \ndid not submit documentation of the actual payments, but the credit reports support his \n\n \n3 \n \nassertion. The April 2016 credit report lists the balance of the debt as $7,408. The three \nsubsequent credit reports list the balance as $5,756 in March 2017; $4,584 in August \n2017; and $3,268 in April 2019. The evidence for the $4,706 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d \nis similar to the above. The balance in 2017 was $4,706. In April 2019, the balance was \n$3,647. (Items 2, 7-10; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant bought a house for $248,500 in 2007. The purchase was financed by a \njoint mortgage loan. It appears that the house was mainly for his wife to live in, as he \nhas lived primarily in Japan since 2006. He lived in the house for about five months in \n2008 to 2009, before returning to Japan. The creditor initiated foreclosure proceedings, \nbut agreed to a short sale. The house was sold for $229,458 in August 2018, which was \nless than what was owed on the mortgage loan. There is no indication that the creditor \nis seeking the deficiency owed on the loan. (Items 2, 4, 7-10; AE A, F) \n \n \nApplicant stated that his finances are greatly improved. He plans to continue \npaying his debts. He will increase the payments to the two remaining consumer debts \nafter the student loans are paid. He expects to be completely debt free within two years. \n(Item 2; AE A, G) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and a \nforeclosed mortgage loan. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h are duplicate accounts. When the same conduct is alleged \ntwice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2005). SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his recent financial problems to his marital separation, \nmedical issues, and a significant reduction in his salary. Those events were beyond his \ncontrol. \n \n \nApplicant has been paying his debts for several years. He paid the $1,488 debt \nto the state in 2017. His four defaulted student loans have been reduced from $18,445 \nto what appears to be less than $1,200. The balances on his two consumer debts have \nbeen reduced from $7,408 to $3,268, and from $4,706 to $3,647. His mortgage loan \nhas been resolved by a short sale. His finances are greatly improved. He plans to \ncontinue paying his debts. He expects to be completely debt free within two years.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were paid through a withholding of his income tax \nrefunds. He does not receive as much credit in mitigation, as he would have if he paid \nthem voluntarily. However, I also note that he did not change his withholding to lower \nthe amount withheld from his paychecks.  \n \n  \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \n\n \n6 \n \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nI believe Applicant is honest and sincere in his intentions to address his \nremaining debts. I find that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took \nsignificant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances \nand made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. The above mitigating conditions are \nsufficiently applicable to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Young, Esq. \n04/23/2019\n___________ \nDecision \n___________ \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant had two alcohol-related driving offenses, was impaired by alcohol on \nduty, and engaged in an alcohol-related disorderly conduct. He was diagnosed as alcohol \ndependent in 2009 and alcohol-use disorder in 2012. He made some positive steps \ntowards rehabilitation; however, security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol \nconsumption) are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.     \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 25, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government \nExhibit (GE) 1) On October 5, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nFebruary 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. The SOR set forth \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline G. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nOn November 20, 2017, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he \nrequested a hearing. (HE 3) On October 3, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nproceed. On October 16, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On November 15, 2018, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for February 7, 2019; however, the hearing was cancelled due to lack of a \nsponsor for Applicant for a security clearance.

(HE 1A) The hearing was held as scheduled.   \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 14 exhibits; Applicant offered 9 \nexhibits; Applicant initially objected to GEs 5 and 7, and then subsequently waived the \nobjection. There were no other objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 12-17, 142; GE 1-14; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-I) On April 1, 2019, DOHA \nreceived a copy of the hearing transcript (Tr.).  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f.

(Tr. 47) \n \nAlcohol Consumption  \n \nThe SOR alleges the following conduct of security significance. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges in August 2004, Applicant was arrested for and convicted of \ndriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Applicant drove after consuming alcohol and \nhit a guard rail. (Tr. 58) He was in Army advanced individual training or AIT when he was \n                                            \n1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

His punishment \nincluded 45 days of extra duty, and his commander required him to attend the Army \nSubstance Abuse Program (ASAP). (Tr. 62-64; GE 7 at \u00b6 1) After completion of AIT, the \nArmy assigned Applicant to a unit in Germany. (Tr. 62)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges in November 2006, Applicant was charged with drunk on duty \nand wrongful distribution of hallucinogens. His NJP included a reduction in rank. As to the \ndrunk on duty offense, Applicant said a sergeant relieved him from duty on New Year\u2019s \nEve. (Tr. 67) He and some other soldiers left the barracks and went to a club, where he \nconsumed alcohol. (Tr. 67) He returned to the barracks and went to sleep. (Tr. 67) The \nfirst sergeant, and the sergeant who released him from duty, came to Applicant\u2019s barracks \nroom. The first sergeant asked Applicant why he was not on duty, and Applicant did not \nrespond to his question because he believed he would not be believed if he said the \nsergeant with the first sergeant released him from duty. (Tr. 67, 113) Applicant\u2019s unit \nreferred him to the ASAP. (Tr. 68, 112) He successfully completed ASAP. (Tr. 68-70; GE \n7 at \u00b6 1) Applicant denied that he was under the influence of alcohol on duty, and he \nclaimed that he was not under the influence of alcohol. (Tr. 69) He believed he was \nunfairly accused of being drunk on duty. (Tr. 70)  \n \nThe allegation of wrongful distribution of hallucinogens was made against \nApplicant several months after the drunk on duty accusation was made. (Tr. 71) An \nairman, who tested positive in a urinalysis test for use of Ecstasy, said Applicant provided \nan Ecstasy pill to him. (Tr. 71; GE 6 at 2-3) Applicant consented to the search of his room \nin the barracks, and the searcher found three Ecstasy pills in the drawer under Applicant\u2019s \nbed. (Tr. 72; GE 6 at 2) Applicant said others had access to his room and must have \nplaced the Ecstasy pills into his drawer. Applicant said he provided statements to the \nArmy Criminal Investigation Command from witnesses who said they did not see \nApplicant commit drug offenses. (Tr. 74-75, 132) Applicant\u2019s commander imposed NJP \nincluding a reduction in grade, forfeiture of half a month\u2019s pay for two months, and extra \nduty. (Tr. 73; GE 14) Applicant said the colonel who imposed the NJP told him that he \nbelieved Applicant; however, he had to punish Applicant to show illegal drugs are not \ntolerated \u201cwhether [he] did it or not.\u201d (Tr. 73, 133-134) Applicant accused the colonel of \npunishing him even though Applicant was innocent. (Tr. 134) Applicant denied his \ninvolvement with illegal drugs. (Tr. 74) Applicant did not provide a statement from anyone \nbesides himself corroborating his assertion that the colonel said he was innocent, but \npunished him anyway. He did not provide proof to support his claim that the colonel \nviolated his rights by knowingly and improperly punishing him for a crime he did not \ncommit.       \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges in August 2008, Applicant voluntarily referred himself for \ntreatment in ASAP. Applicant did not recall his self-referral for treatment in ASAP. (Tr. 76, \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \n78; GE 7) Applicant was diagnosed in March 2009, as alcohol dependent. (Tr. 76, 131; \nGE 5; GE 7)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges in June 2009, Applicant was charged with DUI, simple assault, \nand disorderly conduct. Applicant got into an altercation after consuming alcohol. He \npleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, and the DUI and assault charges were dismissed.  \n \nIn 2009, Applicant was with a friend at a bar. (Tr. 79) Applicant drank four or five \nstrong drinks, and Applicant admitted he was intoxicated. (Tr. 80-81) Applicant was the \nonly Black person in the bar, and a man came up to Applicant, asked him for a cigarette, \nand called him a n _ _ _ _ r. (Tr. 82) More words were exchanged, and Applicant left the \nbar and went to the parking lot. (Tr. 83) Applicant described his own conduct in the bar \nas reasonable and peaceful.

(Tr. 83) Someone tackled Applicant and knocked Applicant \ndown. Others kicked Applicant and his friend while they were down. (Tr. 83-84) Applicant \nsaid, \u201cI heard the whole, entire bar . . . [say] \u2018[w]e\u2019re going to hang us a n _ _ _ _ r.\u2019\u201d (Tr. \n84) Applicant said he believed they were going to get a rope and drag him down the street \nby the neck. (Tr. 84) Applicant and his friend left in his friend\u2019s vehicle. (Tr. 84) A short \ntime later, the police arrested Applicant and his friend. (Tr. 85) Applicant did not recall \nwhether a blood alcohol test (BAT) was administered, and Applicant denied that he was \ndriving. (GE 3 at 7) The police told Applicant that the person Applicant punched had \u201ca \npretty bad gash on his head.\u201d (Tr. 85) According to the notice of preliminary hearing, \nApplicant was charged with simple assault, disorderly conduct, DUI/high rate of alcohol \n.10-.16, and DUI/Gen IMP/INCAP of driving safely. (GE 8)  Applicant\u2019s friend was charged \nwith DUI, simple assault, and disorderly conduct. (Tr. 86) Applicant pleaded guilty to \ndisorderly conduct, and the other charges were withdrawn. (Tr. 88; GE 8) He received \ncourt fees totaling $229. (Tr. 88; GE 8) Applicant\u2019s record was subsequently expunged. \n(Tr. 88; AE A)   \n \n  On March 2, 2009, an Army social worker and ASAP Clinical Director evaluated \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption. (GE 7) She indicated he met three of seven criteria for \nalcohol dependence, and his beer consumption during ASAP established a fourth criteria. \n(GE 7)2 The Clinical Director indicated that his diagnosis of alcohol dependence \u201cbecame \n                                            \n2 In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association issued the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \nMental Disorders (DSM\u2013IV-TR).  This manual indicates that if three of the following seven criteria are met \nin the previous year, a diagnosis of alcohol dependence is warranted. The seven criteria are as follows: \n \nHad to drink much more than you once did to get the effect you want? Or found that your \nusual number of drinks had much less effect than before? \n \nFound that when the effects of alcohol were wearing off, you had withdrawal symptoms, \nsuch as trouble sleeping, shakiness, restlessness, nausea, sweating, a racing heart, or a \nseizure? Or sensed things that were not there? \n \nHad times when you ended up drinking more, or longer, than you intended? \n \nMore than once wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn\u2019t? \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \na point of contention for [Applicant] and he spent a number of weeks fixated on this and \nhis adamant disagreement with same.\u201d (GE 6 at \u00b6 2) Applicant claimed the ASAP Clinical \nDirector said that \u201cAnyone that has two sittings a year drinking alcohol, and in those two \nsittings drink[s] more than two drinks, is considered an alcoholic.\u201d (Tr. 98, 118, 123) \nApplicant denied that he was an \u201calcoholic\u201d; however, he said he did \u201cbinge drink.\u201d (Tr. \n98, 111-112) He said the statement in the Clinical Director\u2019s report that he drank half a \nbeer while in ASAP was false, but that she was not lying. (Tr. 134-135) He did not recall \nadmitting to her that he drank beer while in ASAP. (Tr. 135) Applicant said he was \nunaware of the diagnosis of alcohol dependency. (Tr. 126) He characterized the Clinical \nDirector as \u201cmean,\u201d \u201cvery attacking,\u201d \u201cvery abusive,\u201d and \u201cvery manipulating.\u201d (Tr. 122, \n134) He said she told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you. I\u2019m going to get you.\u201d (Tr. 134) He denied \nthat anyone told him not to drink alcohol. (Tr. 119)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges in September 2011, Applicant was charged with DUI. After \nattending a civilian substance abuse program, the charge in state court was dismissed.  \nIn May 2012, Applicant\u2019s command charged him with operating a vehicle while drunk \nunder Article 111, UCMJ. He was discharged from the service in lieu of courts-martial, \nand he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. \n \nIn September 2011, Applicant and his spouse were both drinking alcohol before \nthey started to drive home. (Tr. 31-32) Applicant was asked how much he had to drink, \nand he said he had a \u201cdrink or two\u201d or \u201cat least two drinks that evening.\u201d (Tr. 91) Applicant \nsaid he did not feel intoxicated. (Tr. 91) Applicant fell asleep while driving to their home \nand hit a tree. (Tr. 32-33, 89) Applicant received serious burns to his legs and had multiple \nbroken bones. (Tr. 23-24, 44, 89-90) He was in a coma for six days and in the hospital \nfor about four months. (Tr. 23-24, 90) His spouse attributed the accident to Applicant\u2019s \nsevere sleep apnea and being tired. (Tr. 33) Applicant\u2019s records indicate he had a BAT; \nhowever, Applicant said he did not remember the result. (Tr. 91; GE 3 at 5) A letter of \nreprimand from a major general indicates that a police officer at the scene of the accident \n\u201cnoted a strong odor of alcohol coming from [Applicant\u2019s] breath and person,\u201d and he had \na BAT result of a .14 blood alcohol content (BAC). (AE B at \u00b6 1) The state dismissed the \nDUI charge. (Tr. 92)  \n \nThe Army preferred a charge of drunk driving against Applicant. (Tr. 93, 136) \nApplicant said his lawyer convinced him that he could not get a fair trial in the military \nbecause \u201c[t]he Army has deep pockets,\u201d \u201cthey are known to get on the witness stand and \nlie,\u201d and \u201c[t]here is no way you could win this.\u201d (Tr. 94-95) He was convinced he was \n                                            \nSpent a lot of time drinking? Or being sick or getting over other aftereffects? \n \nGiven up or cut back on activities that were important or interesting to you, or gave you \npleasure, in order to drink? \n \nContinued to drink even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious or adding to \nanother health problem? Or after having had a memory blackout? \n \nSee National Institute of Health Fact Sheet discussing DSM-IV and DSM-V.

(Tr. 138)   \n \nApplicant was a sergeant (E-5) before being reduced to private (E-1) through an \nadministrative reduction related to being charged with operating a vehicle while drunk and \nreceipt of a discharge under Chapter 10 of Army Regulation 635-200. (Tr. 45, 95) He \nreceived a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 45-46, 97)3 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges from about February 2012 to July 2012, Applicant received \ntreatment at an ASAP. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence. Applicant self- \nreferred himself to ASAP. (Tr. 126) He said he decided not to get drunk anymore. (Tr. \n127) Applicant said he successfully completed ASAP. (GE 1) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant continues to consume alcohol notwithstanding his \ndiagnosis of alcohol dependence. Applicant said he ended his alcohol consumption in \nJune 2017. (Tr. 104) He also said he stopped drinking alcohol after the accident in 2011 \nor his alcohol consumption was \u201cclose to none\u201d until his birthday in June 2017. (Tr. 104-\n105) He said he did not drink alcohol and drive after the accident in 2011. (Tr. 105) He \nclaimed he did not drink alcohol while he was in ASAP. (Tr. 120-121) He denied that he \nwas alcohol dependent. (Tr. 129) There is no evidence that Applicant currently consumes \nalcohol, and SOR \u00b6 1.g is not substantiated. \n \nApplicant denied receipt of the January 14, 2010 memorandum from the Army \nCentral Personnel Security Clearance Facility (CPSCF) granting his access to sensitive \ncompartmented information and top secret information, and warning him not to have any \nfuture incidents involving alcohol, criminal conduct, or other unfavorable information \nbecause it may result in suspension of his security clearance. (Tr. 124; GE 12) There is \nno receipt signed by Applicant in the file showing Applicant received the January 14, 2010 \nArmy CPSCF memorandum. (GE 12)    \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse said the last time she observed him consuming alcohol was on \nhis birthday in June 2017. (Tr. 20) She said on that occasion, he drank one half of a glass \nof wine. (Tr. 20, 37) Applicant said he had \u201ctwo glasses of wine on [his] birthday.\u201d (Tr. \n128) After the accident in 2011, he seldom consumed alcohol and not to intoxication. (Tr. \n21) His alcohol-related accident in 2011 was a shock to him, and he changed. (Tr. 21) He \ndenied that he drank to intoxication after the accident in 2011. (Tr. 128) He denied drinking \nalcohol after his birthday in June 2017. (Tr. 129) His spouse maintains wine in her house. \n(Tr. 22) In 2015, Applicant and his spouse were baptized, and his church is available to \n                                            \n3 Applicant denied that he admitted the offense as part of the discharge process or he did not \nremember admitting an offense carrying a bad-conduct discharge. (Tr. 136-137) Under Army Regulation \n(AR) 635-200, Active Duty Enlisted Administrative Separations, Chapter 10, paragraph 10-2e, \u201cThe \nSoldier\u2019s written request will also include an acknowledgment that he/she understands the elements of the \noffense (s) charged and is guilty of the charge(s) or of a lesser included offense(s) therein contained which \nalso \nauthorizes \nthe \nimposition \nof \na \npunitive \ndischarge. \n(See \nfig \n10\u20131, \npara \n2.),\u201d \nhttps://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR pubs/DR a/pdf/web/AR635-200 Web FINAL 18JAN2017 .pdf. The \nrequirement for this admission of guilt to a serious offense has been part of AR 635-200, Chapter 10 for \nmore than 30 years. When a Chapter 10 discharge is approved, the soldier being discharged is \nadministratively reduced to private E-1. \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nhim as a support system. (Tr. 22-25) His spouse indicates Applicant has \u201cgreat integrity,\u201d \nand she recommends approval of his security clearance. (Tr. 38) He said he \u201ctook \nresponsibility\u201d for his conduct. (Tr. 70, 140-141) \n \nOn September 9, 2016, an Officer Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed Applicant about his history of alcohol consumption. (GE 3) The summary of \nthe OPM interview states: \n \nIn 2009 or 2010; Subject could not be more specific, Subject found [G]od \nand dedicated himself to his family and Subject\u2019s drinking decreased to its \ncurrent level of three to four mixed drinks over a five to six hour time period \nonce or twice per year during the holidays. . . . Subject has no intent on \nchanging his drinking habits in the future. (GE 3 at 11)    \n \nApplicant said he had changed after the accident in 2011. (Tr. 100) \u201c[He] had an \nout-of-body experience where [he] met the Creator.\u201d (Tr. 100) The Creator held Applicant \nby the neck over a fire and said, \u201cIs this what you want?\u201d (Tr. 101) He responded that he \nwanted a second chance, and he woke up in the hospital. (Tr. 101) Applicant believed he \nhealed from his injuries \u201cat a supernatural rate.\u201d (Tr. 101-102) He considers himself to be \nhonest, responsible, reliable, and trustworthy. (Tr. 107) \n \nIn sum, Applicant successfully completed ASAP in April 2005, January 2009, and \nFebruary 2012. (AE D) He has never had a positive urinalysis for use of illegal drugs. (AE \nD) In 2012, he was diagnosed with alcohol-use disorder. (AE D) In February 2012, he \nmade a commitment to abstain from alcohol use. (AE D) At his hearing, he promised to \nabstain from alcohol consumption in the future.   \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nBefore Applicant deployed to Iraq with a task force, his colonel said \u201cwe were going \nto lose 40 \u2013 almost half, 44 percent, which we did lose half.\u201d (Tr. 66) Applicant said he \nwas a gunner for \u201cover 279 missions.\u201d (Tr. 66) His \u201cmind state was that I\u2019m going to die, \nbut if I\u2019m going to die, I\u2019m going to die honorably, and just, you know for my brothers and \nsisters that wear the flag.\u201d (Tr. 66)  \n \nWhile in Iraq, Applicant said he received multiple Combat Action Badges (CAB).4 \nHe explained why he only had one CAB in his records as follows: \n                                            \n4 I decline to credit Applicant with receipt of more than one Combat Action Badge. The Army Human \nRelations Command website states: \n \nSubsequent award of the CAB is not authorized during the same qualifying period. The \nqualifying period is defined as the contingency/conflict for which the Secretary of the Army \nauthorized combat badges is awarded. Currently, the only qualifying period for award of \nthe CAB is the GWOT. OEF, OIF, and OND are operations within the GWOT \ncontingency/conflict. Therefore, no matter how many times a Soldier rotates to the theater, \nonly one award of each combat badge is authorized. (For example, a Soldier who engages \nin combat with the enemy during OIF I, OEF III, and OIF V will only receive one CAB.). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nAnd I remember throwing them down. I was, like, I\u2019m tired of these combat \naction badges. And I remember throwing them down and walking away \nbecause I was upset about . . . all the combat, the killing. And I said, I\u2019m \ntired of you giving me awards for killing all these people. And I just walked \naway, and I said, you know. Give me money for the combat action badges, \nbecause I saw no value to it. (Tr. 139) \n \nHe indicated records were burned in the trunk of his car during the accident in 2011. (Tr. \n139-140) He did not provide corroborative evidence that he was a gunner for \u201cover 279 \nmissions,\u201d that he was assigned to a unit that sustained a high percentage of combat \ncasualties, or that he was awarded multiple CABs. \n \nApplicant said that after he came back from Iraq, he described symptoms of having \npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a doctor \u201cthrew some pills at [him]\u201d and told \nhim he would be fine in three months. (Tr. 77) Applicant threw the pills in the trash. (Tr. \n77) The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) decided that he had a disability rating of 90 \npercent, which included 30 percent for PTSD. (Tr. 135; AE D) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DD Form 214 indicates he has the following medals, badges, and \nribbons: Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM); Army Achievement Medal (AAM) (6th \nAward); Army Superior Unit Award (ASUA); Army Good Conduct Medal (AGCM); National \nDefense Service Medal (NDSM); Global War on Terrorism Service Medal (GWTSM); Iraq \nCampaign Medal with Campaign Star (ICMCS); Noncommissioned Officer Professional \nDevelopment Ribbon (NCOPDR) (2nd Award); Army Service Ribbon (ASR); Overseas \nService Ribbon (OSR) (2nd Award); Combat Action Badge (CAB); and Certificate of \nAchievement (COR). (GE 4; AE G) He completed multiple military training courses. (GE \n4) He served in Iraq from August 2006 to October 2007. (GE 4) He also served an \noverseas tour in Germany.    \n \n \nIn 2017, Applicant received an excellent performance evaluation from his \nemployer. (AE E) He also received some excellent evaluation reports when he was in the \nArmy. (AE F) Applicant was the distinguished honor graduate of a course. (Tr. 47) He \nprovided award certificates and orders for several medals and one CAB as listed on his \nDD Form 214. (AE F) Letters of recommendation from his spouse, supervisors, friends, \nand colleagues lauded Applicant\u2019s intelligence, diligence, positive attitude, enthusiasm, \nhonesty, friendliness, athleticism when he was younger, and professionalism. (AE H) \n   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \n                                            \nU.S. Army Human Relations website, The Adjutant General Directorate(TAGD), Combat Action \nBadge, https://www.hrc.army.mil/TAGD/Combat%20Action%20Badge%20CAB.  \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \napplicant\u2019s personal or professional history that may disqualify the applicant for eligibility \nfor access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, \n1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions under the alcohol consumption guideline that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying including: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) through 22(d) apply. The SOR does not allege evidence to support \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e), 22(f), and 22(g). Applicant\u2019s four alcohol-related incidents involving the \npolice, courts, or his command occurred from 2004 to 2011. His BAC for three of the four \nalcohol-related incidents is unknown. His BAC for the 2011 DUI was .14. He was impaired \nby alcohol in 2006 when he was supposed to be on duty. His .14 BAC established that \nhe engaged in binge alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment.5 In 2009, \n                                            \n5 \u201cBinge drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol use in the United States.\u201d See \nthe Center for Disease Control website, (stating \u201cThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nhe was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, and in 2012, he was diagnosed with alcohol-\nuse disorder. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n  \n \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a fairly \nlengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at \n3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); \nISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).

For example, in ISCR \nCase No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board reversed the \nadministrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol-related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Mar. 21, 2007) (involving \ncase with most recent alcohol-related incident three years before hearing, and reversing \nadministrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n \nI have carefully considered the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption. Applicant presented some \nevidence supporting mitigation of alcohol consumption concerns. Applicant successfully \ncompleted ASAP in April 2005, January 2009, and February 2012. He has never had a \npositive urinalysis for use of illegal drugs. In February 2012, he made a commitment to \nabstain from alcohol use; however, he occasionally drank alcohol until his birthday in \n2017. He has not had any alcohol-related incidents involving the police or courts since \nhis DUI resulting in serious injury in 2011.    \n \nSeveral factors weigh against mitigation of alcohol consumption security concerns: \n(1) Applicant\u2019s four alcohol-related offenses; (2) his reluctance to permanently abstain \nfrom alcohol consumption; (3) his binge alcohol consumption to the extent of having a .14 \nBAC; (4) his diagnosis  of alcohol abuse; (5) his resumption of alcohol consumption after \nprevious periods of abstinence and SARP attendances; and (6) credibility issues relating \nto his pejorative allegations against his battalion commander who imposed NJP for his \ndistribution of Ecstasy, allegations against his defense attorney, including claims that he \ncould not receive a fair trial from the Army, and his complaints about the Clinical Director \nbeing out to get him and using improper criteria for evaluating him in 2009. I have lingering \ndoubts and concerns about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment pertaining to his history of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption security \nconcerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. \u201cIn evaluating an applicant\u2019s case, a \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nJudge must carefully consider the record as a whole. This includes not only considering the \nextent to which an applicant\u2019s circumstances raise concerns about his or her reliability but \nalso giving fair consideration of the applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-\n09900 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00424 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. \n20, 2016)). My comments under Guideline G are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, and he is employed as a senior systems security \nspecialist. He has an associate\u2019s degree in computer science. In 2015, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in systems security. He is in the process of obtaining his certification \nas an information systems manager. He has a strong resume in communications security \nand information technology.  \n \nApplicant served in the Army from 2004 to July 2012. He was a senior \ncommunications security repair specialist. In 2010, he held a top secret clearance with \naccess to SCI. He said he never had a security violation. Applicant\u2019s DD Form 214 \nindicates he has the following medals, badges, and ribbons: ARCOM; AAM (6th Award); \nASUA; AGCM; NDSM; GWTSM; ICMCS; NCOPDR (2nd Award); ASR; OSR (2nd \nAward); CAB; and COR. He completed multiple military training courses. He successfully \ncompleted overseas tours in Germany and most importantly served in Iraq from August \n2006 to October 2007. The VA has awarded him a 90 percent disability rating including \n30 percent for PTSD. He received excellent performance evaluations, and he provided \ncharacter letters praising his intelligence, diligence, positive attitude, enthusiasm, \nhonesty, friendliness, athleticism when he was younger, and professionalism.   \n \nThe evidence weighing against grant of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information \nis more persuasive:  (1) his four alcohol-related offenses (DUIs in 2004 and 2011-the \n2011 DUI resulted in serious injury; impaired by alcohol for duty in 2006; and disorderly \nconduct in 2009 resulting in injury); (2) his reluctance to permanently abstain from alcohol \nconsumption; (3) his binge alcohol consumption to the extent of .14 BAC in 2011; (4) his \ndiagnosis  of alcohol abuse in 2012; (5) his resumption of alcohol consumption after \nprevious periods of abstinence and SARP attendance; and (6) credibility issues where he \nmade excuses and did not accept full responsibility for his conduct as indicated by his \nclaims that his battalion commander improperly imposed NJP for his distribution of \nEcstasy and his Clinical Director improperly diagnosed him as alcohol dependent \nbecause she was out to get him. Based on these factors, I have lingering doubts and \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. A \nsignificant probability of alcohol-related judgment errors in the future continues to exist, \nand his lengthy history of alcohol consumption raises ongoing questions about his \nreliability and trustworthiness. See AG \u00b6 21.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as \nset forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that Guideline G security \nconcerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He filed all of his overdue returns, paid all federal \ntaxes owed, and is complying with his state\u2019s tax payment agreement. He has been \nacting responsibly under the circumstances. His financial problems are being resolved \nand are under control. The omissions in his 2015 security clearance application (SCA) \nwere not deliberate. Clearance granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an SCA on February 25, 2015, seeking to continue the \nclearance required for his position with a federal contractor. He was interviewed by a \ngovernment background investigator in June and November 2016, and answered a set \nof interrogatories in June 2017. (GE 2) After reviewing the information gathered during \nthe background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on July 31, 2017, alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on September 15, 2017, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \n04/05/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 18, 2018, who \nconvened a hearing on August 29, 2018. At the hearing, the administrative judge \nadmitted three documents as Hearing Exhibits (HE I-III). (Tr. 12-15) The Government \noffered six exhibits (GE 1 through 6). (Tr. 15) Applicant testified and submitted five \nexhibits (AE 1 through 5). (Tr. 6-7, and 16) All exhibits were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 7, 2018. \n \nFollowing the hearing, the administrative judge developed an ongoing medical \ncondition that prevented her from writing a decision. DOHA reassigned the case to me \non February 27, 2019, to expedite the clearance process. On March 1, 2019, I notified \nthe parties that the case was reassigned to me. I provided Applicant the opportunity to \nrequest a new hearing, or to agree for me to write a decision based on the record, \nincluding the August 29, 2018 transcript and all evidence submitted at the hearing. \nBecause of the elapsed period, I allowed the parties the opportunity to supplement the \nrecord with additional documentary evidence. (See HE IV \u2013 email notice to the parties.) \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s response included a recent credit report from March 2019. \nThe credit report were marked as GE 4 and made part of the record. Applicant\u2019s emails \nagreeing to me issuing the decision based on the established record were marked AE 6 \nand admitted.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nAt hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the third line in SOR \u00b6 2.b by \nchanging the date \u201cMay 2016\u201d to read \u201cMay 2015.\u201d Without objections, the motion was \ngranted as requested. (Tr. 6) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2011, 2014, and 2016; and state income tax returns for \ntax years 2013 and 2014. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, respectively.) Under Guideline E, the \nSOR alleged that Applicant failed twice to adhere to court-ordered alcohol abstinence in \n2015. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b) It further alleged that Applicant falsified his 2015 SCA when \nhe answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions in Section 26 (Financial Record) and failed to disclose \nthat he did not timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2014, and 2016; \nand state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) \n \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 2.c. He denied SOR \u00b6 2.a, but at his hearing, Applicant amended his SOR Answer \nand admitted the allegation. (Tr. 71) He denied SOR \u00b6 2.b. His admissions to the SOR \nand at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of \nthe record evidence, including his testimony and all evidence admitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact:  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He received a \nGeneral Education Development (GED) certificate in 1978. Since then, he has \ncompleted numerous job-related technical certifications. He has never been married, \nand has no children.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history shows that he has worked for different federal \ncontractors since 1990. He has held a secret clearance continuously since the early \n1990s. His current employer and security sponsor hired him in July 2014. \n \nApplicant explained that his failure to file 2011 income tax returns resulted from \nmedical problems in 2011-2012 (diagnosed with cancer). He received treatment during \ntwo years, but he is now considered to be in remission. (Tr. 20-22) Additionally, in 2014, \nhe withdrew $50,000 from his 401k retirement account to buy a home. He was not \naware of the tax penalties associated with an early withdrawal of 401k monies, and the \nadditional income placed him in a higher tax bracket. Applicant claimed that he \nprepared the 2014 federal income tax return, but did not file it because he did not have \nthe money to pay the tax owed. Apparently, he also failed to file his 2016 federal income \ntax return and his state tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014 because he did not \nhave the money to pay the taxes owed. He averred that unexpected maintenance costs \nfor his new home were so high that he did not have the money to pay his owed taxes \nand did not file his income tax returns. (Tr. 22-23) \n \nApplicant also stated during his 2016 interview with a government investigator \nthat he did not file his 2014 and 2016 income tax returns because he moved \nresidences, and he could not find his documents. He was not diligent about filing \nbecause he believed it was not a big deal since he believed that he owed no taxes. He \npromised the investigator that he would promptly file his 2014 and 2015 income tax \nreturns, and he did. (GE 2) \n \nAfter his 2016 interview, Applicant became scared about the concerns raised by \nhis failure to file his 2014 income tax returns and hired a tax preparer to do so. He filed \nhis 2014 federal income tax return in February 2017, and in June 2017, he paid the IRS \n$27,000 for back taxes. (Tr. 100) At his hearing, Applicant testified he had filed all of his \noverdue returns and he owed no back taxes to the IRS. \n \nAlthough Applicant requested tax return transcripts for tax years 2008 \u2013 2010, \nthe IRS no longer has those records. The IRS Wage and Income Transcript form for tax \nyear 2011 (prepared in 2017) shows that Applicant filed his 2010 income tax return and \nreceived a $53 refund. The IRS Wage and Income Transcript form for tax year 2011 \ndoes not indicate that Applicant filed his 2011 income tax return. (Only the first page \nwas submitted and it appears to be a multipage document.) He provided no \ndocumentary evidence to show he filed it, but implied that he did. (Tr. 33) During his \n2016 interview, Applicant told the investigator that he did not file his 2011 income tax \nreturn, and when confronted by the IRS about it, and threatened with a garnishment of \nwages, Applicant agreed to the garnishment of wages to satisfy the 2011 tax debt. (GE \n2, Tr. 77-81) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2012 federal income tax return in October 2013. He filed his \n2013 federal income tax return in April 2014. He filed his 2014 federal income tax return \nin February 2017. Apparently, he filed his 2015 income tax return between 2016 and \n2017. He requested a 2015 tax transcript, but the IRS informed him that there was an \nidentity theft issue with that year\u2019s return. (GE 2) He filed his 2016 federal income tax \nreturn on June 26, 2017. (GE 2) \n \nConcerning his 2013 and 2014 state income tax returns, Applicant testified he \nfiled them late and paid off any taxes due for tax year 2013. He still owes about $2,000 \nfor tax year 2014, but has been making $150 monthly payments as agreed. (Tr. 35) \n \nSection 26 (Financial Record - Taxes) of the 2015 SCA, asked Applicant to \ndisclose whether in the last seven years he had failed to file or pay federal, state, or \nother taxes when required by law. Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to disclose that \nhe did not timely file a federal income tax return for tax year 2011, and a state income \ntax return for tax year 2013. I note that Applicant submitted the 2015 SCA in February \n2015. Thus, at that time, the only late returns would have been the 2011 federal return \nand the 2013 state return.  \n \nApplicant admitted that he provided an inaccurate response in his 2015 SCA, but \naverred that he is an honest person who made an inadvertent and honest mistake. \nApplicant explained he had submitted an SCA before he failed to file his income tax \nreturns in 2011, and before he was charged with DUI in 2014. (The prior SCA is not part \nof the record.) When his employer\u2019s FSO found out about his 2014 DUI charge, \nApplicant was asked to update the prior SCA with the DUI information. Because he was \nnot asked to update the whole SCA, he only updated the DUI questions, and did not \nlook at or update any other SCA sections, including the questions about his failure to file \nincome tax returns. Applicant highlighted that when he was asked during his 2016 \ninterview about his tax problems, he promptly disclosed that he had failed to file his \nfederal income tax returns for 2011 and 2014; the state returns for 2013 and 2014; and \nhe disclosed that he had identity theft issues with his 2015 tax return. (Ge 2, Tr. 24-25) \n \nRegarding the SOR allegations that Applicant failed twice to adhere to court-\nordered alcohol abstinence in 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b), I find that the evidence is \ninsufficient to establish SOR \u00b6 2.b. Applicant explained that the court ordered him to \nabstain from alcohol consumption while undergoing alcohol counseling. Applicant \nadmitted that during his counseling period, he took a urinalysis screening for alcohol in \nhis system and failed once. (GE 5) He denied that the Interlock device in his vehicle \nwas ever fully triggered. He repeatedly stated that the device had a false positive on \none occasion, but that the Interlock device was not activated. When he retried the \nInterlock device after five minutes, the car started. After Applicant\u2019s compliance with the \nother terms of his sentence, the charge for violating the terms of his probation was \ndismissed. (Tr. 75, GE 5) \n \nApplicant considers himself to be honest, reliable, hardworking, and a key player \nwithin his company. He believes he will be devastated if he was to lose his clearance \n\n \n5 \n \n \neligibility because he would likely lose his job, and at his age it would be difficult to get a \nnew job. His references consider Applicant to be honest, trustworthy, dedicated, \nhardworking, and a competent and valuable employee. They endorsed his eligibility for \na clearance. \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he made a mistake when he failed to timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns because he did not have the money to pay the \ntaxes owed. He acknowledged he should have been more diligent about filing the \nincome tax returns. He believes that he has learned a valuable lesson. He understands \nthe seriousness of the security concerns raised by his tax problems. He promised to \ntimely file and pay his taxes in the future. Applicant highlighted his 40 years of \nemployment with federal contractors while holding a clearance since 1990s. He believes \nthat his financial situation is now stable.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2014, \nand 2016; and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014. He explained he \nfailed to file his 2011 income tax returns because of health problems. Apparently, when \nconfronted by the IRS about his failure to file and threatened with a garnishment of \nwages, he agreed to the garnishment and paid the taxes owed. \n \nApplicant provided several reasons for his failure to timely file his federal tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 and 2016; and his state tax returns for tax years 2013 and \n2014: medical problems related to his cancer diagnosis and treatment; the purchase of \na home in 2014; and moving residences and not being able to find his documents. He \nstated that in 2014 his taxes were complicated because he withdrew $50,000 from his \n401k retirement account to purchase a home. He was unaware of the penalties \nassociated with the early withdrawal of monies from the retirement account, and he \nended up in a higher tax bracket.  \n \nApplicant testified that he prepared his own 2014 tax return, but when he realized \nhe did not have the money to pay the taxes owed, he did not file it. After his 2016 \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninterview, Applicant hired a professional tax preparer, and filed his 2014 federal income \ntax return in February 2017. In June 2017, he paid the IRS $27,000 for back taxes owed \nfor 2014. He wanted to clear any possible security concerns about him owing taxes as \nsoon as possible. As of his hearing, Applicant had filed all federal (except for 2011) and \nstate tax returns and claimed he owed no back taxes to the IRS. He is in a payment \nagreement with the state authorities for taxes owed for 2014. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \n\u201c(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay . . . . income tax as required.\u201d The record established the disqualifying \nconditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n\n \n8 \n \n \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nSome of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are raised by \nthe facts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare ongoing and recent because he is still paying his state back taxes. However, his \nfinancial problems occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur and they do not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems could be attributed to, or were aggravated by, his \ncancer illness and his lack of knowledge concerning penalties for early withdrawal of \n401k monies. He has filed all his income tax returns, paid any federal tax owed, and has \na payment arrangement with the state. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged he made a mistake by not timely filing his tax returns \nand believing it was not important to file if all taxes owed had been paid. He now \nunderstands that he should have been more diligent filing and paying his taxes. \nApplicant established that when he became aware of the security concerns raised by \nhis failure to file and pay his taxes, he quickly made arrangements with a tax preparer to \nhelp him resolve his tax problems.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to timely file and pay his taxes are not ideal, but he made an \neffort to resolve his tax problems. He also is paying his tax debt to his state via monthly \npayments. I note that Applicant has timely filed and paid all his taxes for tax years 2016 \nand 2017. He owes no taxes for those years. His actions show diligence and \nresponsibility in the handling of his tax obligations. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, and including his recent actions, Applicant \nhas been financially responsible under the circumstances. His financial situation is \nimproving and there are clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved \nand under control.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nnational security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities;1 and  \n \n(d) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \nRegarding the allegations that Applicant failed twice to adhere to court-ordered \nalcohol abstinence in 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b), I find that the evidence is insufficient \nto establish the Interlock device violation (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted that during his \ncounseling period, he took a urinalysis screening for alcohol and failed once. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a) The charge for violating the terms of his probation was dismissed by the court after \nApplicant\u2019s compliance with the other terms of his sentence.  \n \nConsidering that there are no alcohol consumption concerns alleged, that the \ncourt dismissed the 2015 court-order violation after Applicant successfully completed \nhis sentence terms, that Applicant admitted his conduct, and the passage of time since \n2015, I find this allegation to be of no security significance, even when considered \nagainst all of the evidence as a whole. \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 2.c, I find that Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose that he failed to \nfile his federal income tax return for tax year 2011, and a state income tax return for tax \nyear 2013, was not deliberate or made with the intent to deceive. Applicant\u2019s \n                                            \n1 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nexplanation, that he was only asked to update the SCA with information regarding his \n2014 DUI, is plausible. Of course, Applicant should have realized that every time he \ncompletes an SCA he has a legal obligation to ensure that its contents are accurate. \nBecause I find that Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the information requested was not \ndeliberate, none of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are applicable to that \nconduct. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for \nfederal contractors since the early 1990s while holding a clearance. The record \nevidence is sufficient to establish that his financial problems are being resolved and are \nunder control. Applicant is fully aware of the security concerns raised by his failure to \ntimely file and pay his taxes. He promised to maintain financial responsibility to ensure \nthat he continues to be eligible for a clearance. I find that Applicant\u2019s omission on his \n2015 SCA was not deliberate or made with the intent to deceive. The financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest of the United States to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance to Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

However, \nhis information was not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s adverse information about his personal conduct and his criminal conduct. \nHis request for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \nOn December 2, 2015, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nhis employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not determine that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nclearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n  \n \nOn August 22, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under the adjudicative guidelines for personal conduct \n(Guideline E), criminal conduct (Guideline J), and financial considerations (Guideline F). \nThe current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence \non December 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. I \nreceived the case on March 11, 2019, and convened the requested hearing on April 17, \n2019. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 11. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibit (AX) A. After the \nhearing, Applicant timely submitted a credit report, dated April 16, 2019 (AX B); proof of \na current automobile insurance policy (AX C); a copy of his cellphone bill for March 8, \n2019, through April 7, 2019 (AX D); and information regarding a U.S. Department of \nTreasury wage garnishment (AX E). All exhibits were admitted without objection, and the \nrecord closed on April 19, 2019. DOHA received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May \n6, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that in July 2015 (SOR 1.a), \nSeptember 2013 (SOR 1.c), July 2013 (SOR 1.d), and September 2012 (SOR 1.g), \nApplicant was charged with criminal domestic violence. It also was alleged that in April \n2004, Applicant was charged with sexual contact with a minor (SOR 1.k). Under Guideline \nJ, these allegations were cross-alleged as criminal conduct (SOR 2.a). \n \n \nAlso under Guideline E, the Government alleged that in April 2015, Applicant was \ninvoluntarily terminated from his employment with a defense contractor (SOR 1.b) for \nreasons of performance, attendance, and timekeeping as specified in SOR 1.b(i) \u2013 1.b(iv). \nIt was also alleged that in February 2013, Applicant was involuntarily terminated from a \ndifferent defense contractor for timekeeping violations (SOR 1.e), and that in November \n2012, he had submitted a falsified resume as part of his application for employment with \nthe SOR 1.e contractor (SOR 1.f). The Government further alleged that Applicant was \ninvoluntarily terminated from jobs in 2008 (SOR 1.h), 2007 (SOR 1.i), and 2006 (SOR \n1.j); and that Applicant has been evicted from at least three different residences (SOR 1.l) \n \n \nFinally, under Guideline E, it was alleged that Applicant intentionally made false \nofficial statements to the Government in his December 2015 e-QIP by claiming that he \nleft the defense contractor job referenced in SOR 1.e and 1.f by mutual agreement (SOR \n1.m); and by repeating that statement to Government investigators during subject \ninterviews in February 2016 (SOR 1.n) and July 2016 (SOR 1.o). \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $8,451 for 15 \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 3.a \u2013 3.o).  \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, all of the \nallegations therein. (Answer; Tr. 12 \u2013 14) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. He earned his general education diploma in May 2004. \nHe matriculated at a college-level technical school in January 2005 and earned an \nassociate\u2019s degree in computer information systems in August 2014. Applicant first \nreceived a security clearance in 2010. He started working in information technology (IT) \npositions starting in December 2012, and he has worked for his current employer since \nMay 2016. Appellant worked as a defense contractor in Afghanistan and Kuwait for a few \nmonths in 2012 and 2015, respectively. (GX 1; GX 6) \n \n \nApplicant was married from July 2007 until divorcing in November 2015. He has \none child from that marriage, which he has described as \u201chorrible.\u201d Applicant also had two \nchildren with a former girlfriend in 2003 and 2004. He also has a 13-year-old child and a \nthree-year-old child with two other former girlfriends. (GX 1; GX 6; Tr. 42, 76 \u2013 79) \n \n \nApplicant fathered his two oldest children when he was 16 and 17 years old, and \ntheir mother was 13 and 14 years old. The children\u2019s maternal grandmother was aware \nof, and consented to, Applicant\u2019s relationship with her daughter. After the older child was \nborn, the grandmother applied for food stamps for her daughter and grandchild. When \nshe again applied for food stamps after the younger grandchild was born, state family \nservices threatened to charge her with neglect of her daughter if the grandmother did not \nfile charges of illegal sexual contact with a minor against Applicant. Under state law where \nthose events occurred, the mother of Applicant\u2019s children was legally incapable, at age \n13 and 14, of consenting to sexual intercourse with Applicant. The grandmother \nsubsequently swore out a warrant against Applicant, who was released on his own \nrecognizance after turning himself in. The charges were later entered as nolle prosequi \nbecause no paternity test was ever conducted and no other physical evidence was \ngathered. Applicant admits the children are his and he is trying to support them. (Answer; \nGX 1; GX 2; GX 7; Tr. 51 \u2013 53) \n \n \nBetween September 2012 and July 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ncriminal domestic violence stemming from arguments that became physical altercations \nwith his ex-wife (SOR 1.a and 1.e) and with two ex-girlfriends (SOR 1.c and 1.d). In each \ncase, the charges were dismissed because the victims did not appear in court as \nwitnesses against Applicant. In each case, Applicant struck or shoved the victims, one of \nwhom was pregnant at the time of the assault. Applicant claims that he is unlikely to \nengage in such conduct in the future because he has received counseling as recently as \nApril 2018, and because he no longer has contact with his ex-wife or his ex-girlfriends. \nHowever, Applicant interacts with each of them when required regarding matters of child \nsupport and visitation. He attributed his 2012 conduct to trouble adjusting after being in \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nAfghanistan for a few months, speculating that he was suffering from post-traumatic \nstress disorder (PTSD). Applicant was never clinically diagnosed with PTSD and he did \nnot provide any documentation about the counseling he has received. (Answer; GX 1; GX \n6; GX 8; Tr. 42 \u2013 46, 57 \u2013 76, 121 \u2013 124) \n \n \nApplicant also has experienced financial problems over the past 15 years. \nBetween July 2007 and November 2009, he and his ex-wife were evicted from three \ndifferent residences for failing to pay rent as required. When they divorced in 2015, \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage was foreclosed because his ex-wife, who retained the property \nthrough their divorce agreement, failed to make the required monthly payments. Applicant \nrecently was able to obtain a mortgage modification and recover the house. As of \nDecember 2017, Applicant owed the debts alleged in SOR 3.a \u2013 3.o. Most of those debts \nresulted from his marriage; however, he also incurred delinquent debts because he has \nbroken at least two leases since his divorce. The debts at SOR 3.a and 3.j are two such \ndebts and they remain unresolved. Applicant successfully disputed several of the debts \nalleged in the SOR as being his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility. Further, Applicant claims his \ncurrent finances are sound. He cites his increased annual salary of $98,000 and his efforts \nto clean up his credit history with the help of a credit repair firm, and his payment of \nmedical debts through an employer-sponsored health savings account as evidence of \nmitigation of the financial security concerns raised in the SOR. A credit report dated April \n16, 2019, shows only three delinquent accounts. Two of the debts listed (SOR 1.h and \n1.i) were paid off in March 2019. He also is in good standing with the creditors listed in \nSOR 1.b and 1.c, and has repaid the debt alleged at SOR 1.m. Another debt for a $3,237 \ndelinquent cellphone account, not alleged in the SOR, is being disputed by Applicant. He \nclaims it was opened by his ex-wife. It is still pending resolution. Available information \ntends to support his claimed disputes of debts from his marriage, and that he already was \ntrying to resolve his debts when the SOR was issued. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 5; GX 6; AX A \u2013 \nE; Tr. 54 \u2013 56, 94 \u2013 114) \n \n \nBetween April 2014 and April 2015, Applicant was employed by Company A, a \ndefense contractor who sponsored his request to renew his eligibility for a security \nclearance. Applicant left that job under adverse circumstances, but the ensuing \nbackground investigation continued because Applicant found work with another defense \ncontractor. While working at Company A, Applicant was repeatedly counseled about his \npoor performance, time-keeping and attendance discrepancies, and various violations of \ncompany policies. Despite being placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP), \nApplicant was either unable or unwilling to comply with company rules. SOR 1.b alleged \nthat Applicant was terminated from that job in April 2015. Available information shows \nthat he left that job voluntarily when it became apparent he would be fired. Applicant went \non to work for three other companies, including his current employer, without apparent \nincident. Applicant\u2019s current supervisor provided a positive recommendation based on \nApplicant\u2019s performance over most of the past three years. (Answer; GX 1; GX 6; GX 9; \nAX A; Tr. 38 \u2013 39, 44 \u2013 45, 90 \u2013 94) \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nBetween October 2006 and April 2008, Applicant was fired from three different \njobs. None of those terminations were due to reduction-in-force layoffs or other factors \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control. Each termination was due to poor job performance or violation \nof employer policies, or a combination of the two. In November 2012, Applicant applied \nfor a position with Company B, another defense contractor. In his application and an \naccompanying resume, he stated that he had an IT-related associate\u2019s degree, with a 3.0 \ngrade point average (GPA). He also stated that the first of the aforementioned involuntary \nterminations in October 2006 occurred because the warehouse where he worked had \nbeen closed. Both statements on his November 2012 job application were false, but it \nwas only after he was confronted on cross-examination with the Government\u2019s \ninformation that he admitted submitting false information in his job application. As to his \nassociate\u2019s degree, Applicant did not receive his degree until August 2014. At the time he \napplied to work at Company B, he was on academic probation with a 1.92 GPA. One of \nthe reasons for being placed on probation was a well-documented instance of plagiarism. \nApplicant\u2019s tenure with Company B was marked by unsatisfactory performance, security \nviolations, and timekeeping and attendance problems. Applicant was counseled verbally \nand in writing on multiple occasions. As alleged in SOR 1.f, he was fired by Company B \non February 2, 2013. (GX 10; GX 11; Tr. 50 \u2013 51, 79 \u2013 90) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his December 2015 e-QIP, he stated he left Company \nB by mutual agreement because Company B\u2019s government customer decided to no \nlonger fund Applicant\u2019s position. During a subject interview with a government investigator \non February 24, 2016, Applicant again stated that he left Company B by mutual \nagreement because of lack of funding. Applicant was re-interviewed on July 25, 2016. In \nthat interview, he again stated that he left Company B by mutual agreement because of \nlack of funding, before being confronted with his Company B employment records. Those \nrecords contained detailed documentation of management\u2019s actions in response to \nApplicant\u2019s poor performance and other on-the-job issues, including disregard for security \nprocedures. When Applicant testified about his termination from Company B, he again \nstated that he left by mutual agreement because of funding issues. His uncorroborated \ntestimony about the alleged security violation also directly contradicted the \ncontemporaneous records produced by the Government. Records generated by \nCompany B management and human resources personnel at the time of Applicant\u2019s \nemployment there make no mention of a lack of funding, and they do not indicate that the \nend of Applicant\u2019s employment was a mutually agreed upon event. Applicant was fired \nfrom Company B for specific, well-documented reasons. Further, in his Answer, Applicant \naverred Company B did not have any paperwork signed by him regarding his dismissal, \nyet the Government\u2019s information contains several items, such as counseling records and \nthe actual termination paperwork, signed by Applicant between December 2012 and \nFebruary 2013. As alleged in SOR 1.m \u2013 1.o, his statements about that event in his e-\nQIP and in two subject interviews constituted intentional false official statements to an \nagency of the United States. I also find that his written response and his testimony about \nthe SOR 1.m \u2013 1.o allegations are intentional false official statements. I did not find \ncredible his testimony about his academic problems and much of his employment history. \n(Answer; GX 1; GX 6; GX 10; Tr. 117 \u2013 120) \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant incurred delinquent or past-due debts \ntotaling $8,451. As of the close of the adjudication of the information obtained in his \nbackground investigation, much of that debt remained unresolved. That information \nreasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \n\u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nAs to mitigation, Applicant established that most of his debts arose from his failed \nmarriage. He also showed that before the SOR was issued, he had taken steps to contest \nthe validity of debts his wife opened in his name and to pay his medical debts. Only two \ndebts alleged in the SOR remain unresolved; however, available information about \nApplicant\u2019s finances supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant is meeting all of his current financial obligations, has not incurred new \ndelinquencies in the past two years, and is unlikely to experience such problems in the \nfuture. On balance, available information is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns \nunder this guideline. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant was charged with felony sexual contact with a minor in 2004 after he \nfathered two children with a girl who was 14 years old or younger. Although he has \nacknowledged his misconduct, the charge was not prosecuted because of lack of \nevidence. Between 2012 and 2015, Applicant was charged on four occasions with \ncriminal domestic violence after two physical altercations with his ex-wife and two \naltercations with ex-girlfriends. None of those charges were prosecuted, but this record, \nincluding Applicant\u2019s testimony, establishes that there were no misunderstandings or \nfalse complaints by the victims. Applicant physically assaulted each of the women \ninvolved. This information reasonably raises a security concern about criminal conduct \nthat is expressed at AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nMore specifically, the record requires application of the following AG \u00b6 31 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 32 mitigating conditions: \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant last engaged in criminal conduct almost four years ago. He claimed he \nis unlikely to repeat his conduct because he has matured and he no longer has contact \nwith any of the women he assaulted; however, he was 30 years old at the time of his most \nrecent arrest, and he still interacts with his ex-wife and at least one ex-girlfriend regarding \nmatters related to their children. He also claimed he has received counseling about his \nconduct, but he did not provide any information about that counseling or its results. For \nthese reasons, and because of unmitigated security concerns about Applicant\u2019s personal \nconduct (discussed under Guideline E, below), I conclude none of the AG \u00b6 31 mitigating \nconditions apply. The security concerns under this guideline are not mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s information established that Applicant has a long history of \nunacceptable conduct that directly undermines confidence in his judgment and his \ntrustworthiness. The information about his employment history, his criminal conduct, and \nhis multiple false official statements raises a security concern about personal conduct \nstates at AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nMore specifically, the record requires application of the following AG \u00b6 16 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . .  \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \n \nI also considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \n \nI conclude that the record does not support application of any of the mitigating \nconditions. Applicant has not made any prompt, good-faith effort to correct his earlier false \nofficial statements. To the contrary, in response to the SOR and at hearing, he repeated \nhis false claims about the reason for his dismissal from Company B. He did not establish \nthat his false answers to e-QIP questions were the product of advice from an authorized \nsource. Applicant\u2019s information did not establish that he has been rehabilitated with \nrespect to his criminal conduct. Although more than four years has passed since his last \narrest, his continued willingness to make false statements, and the lack of information \nabout his counseling sustain doubts about his judgment. \n \n \nAn ongoing security concern is Applicant\u2019s long record of poor job performance, \nincluding repeated violations of rules and regulations. Although he recently has \nexperienced more employment stability and has the support of his current supervisor, the \nlength of Applicant\u2019s adverse employment record, and his repeated willingness to make \nfalse statements about this part of his background, preclude a conclusion that such events \nwill not recur. The security concerns under this guideline are not mitigated. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Of note is the positive information about Applicant\u2019s recent job performance \nand reputation in the workplace. Nonetheless, this record presents a compendium of \nadverse information over the past 15 years that requires more substantial mitigating \ninformation to overcome the doubts raised by his personal conduct and criminal conduct. \n\n \n \n12 \n \n \nBecause protection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, \nany remaining doubts must be resolved against the granting of access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 2.a: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.o: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Item 3.) On May 23, 2017, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) \nand G (Alcohol Consumption). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on August 1, 2017, and \nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2.) A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) prepared by Department Counsel, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2\nconsisting of Items 1 to 5, was provided to Applicant on September 6, 2017.

He did not submit additional \ninformation. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2018. Based upon a review \nof the pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nThe SOR in this case was issued under the adjudicative guidelines that came \ninto effect within the DoD on September 1, 2006. Security Executive Agent Directive \n(SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), implements \nnew adjudicative guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. All national security eligibility \ndecisions2 issued on or after June 8, 2017, are to be decided using the new National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), as implemented in Appendix \nA of SEAD 4. I considered the previous adjudicative guidelines, as well as the new AG, \nin adjudicating Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility.

Any such mitigating information will \nbe discussed later in this decision. \n2 SEAD 4 \u00b6 D.7 defines \u201cNational Security Eligibility\u201d as, \u201cEligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, to include access to sensitive compartmented information, restricted \ndata, and controlled or special access program information.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct) \n \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national \nsecurity eligibility because he has a history of criminal conduct. Applicant admitted all \nthree allegations under this paragraph. \n \n \n1.a. Applicant was arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) in April 2011. \nApplicant pled guilty and was sentenced to two years of probation, and 12 months and 5 \ndays in jail, with 11 months and 25 days suspended. Appellant stated that he spent two \nweekends at the city jail farm. (Item 3 at Section 22.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant was arrested a second time for DWI on December 18, 2015. This \nwas about a week after signing his e-QIP (Item 3), in which he discussed his first DWI \narrest. He pled guilty on April 19, 2016, and was sentenced to spend ten days in jail, \nthree years of probation, suspension of his driver\u2019s license for three years, and he was \nrequired to take and complete an Outpatient Substance Abuse Program. His probation \nwill end in approximately April 2019. (Item 5.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he drank alcohol on July 22, 2016, while taking a 26-\nweek substance abuse program. His alcohol use was discovered because Applicant \nwas tested by the program. His treatment program was extended from 26 weeks to 36 \nweeks. Applicant stated in his response to DoD CAF interrogatories that he completed \nthe program on March 23, 2017. Applicant has been diagnosed with Moderate Alcohol \nUse Disorder. He further stated that he goes to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) one to two \ntimes a week. Applicant submitted no documentary information from the counseling \nprogram to support his statement that he had successfully completed it. (Item 5.) \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national \nsecurity eligibility because he abuses intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted the sole \nallegation under this paragraph, which states that the conduct set forth under Paragraph \n1, above, is cognizable under this paragraph as well. \n \n \nApplicant stated in his response to interrogatories that he stopped drinking \nalcohol on July 22, 2016. He further stated that he stopped using alcohol because he \nhad received a second DWI, and his personal health. Applicant also stated that he had \nno intention of using alcohol in the future. (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant did not submit any evidence concerning the quality of his job \nperformance. He submitted no character references or other evidence tending to \nestablish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his \ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided \nwithout a hearing. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge=s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole-person concept.@ The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, \u201cThe \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information.  \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions apply: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \nApplicant had alcohol-related arrests and convictions for Driving While \nIntoxicated in 2011 and 2015. He is currently on probation for the 2015 arrest until April \n2019. All three of these disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense;  and \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, as described in the Findings of Fact, was serious, recent, \nand criminal. He is on probation until April 2019. He has introduced insufficient evidence \nto support a finding that he has mitigated his misconduct under this guideline. \nParagraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven disqualifying conditions that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying. Six conditions possibly apply to the facts in \nthis case: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed;  \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\nApplicant has a history of drinking to excess, as shown by the two alcohol-related \nincidents set forth in the SOR and discussed above. The last incident was in December \n2015. He entered treatment in 2016, and the treatment was extended from twenty-six \nweeks to thirty-six weeks because he drank while in the program, which violated \nprogram rules and the pertinent court order.   \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate alcohol \nconsumption security concerns.  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions were established in this case. Applicant had \ntwo alcohol-related arrests for Driving While Intoxicated, the last in December 2015. He \nstates he successfully completed his outpatient treatment, but did not provide any \nsupporting documentation. He states that he has been abstinent from alcohol since July \n2016, but once again we have no evidence to support Applicant\u2019s statement. Applicant \nappears to have difficulty accepting or admitting he has a problem with alcohol. \nConsidering all the available evidence, I find that not enough time has passed without \nan incident to be confident that he will not resume drinking and acting irresponsibly \nwhile under the influence. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility and a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence as \ndescribed above leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as to Applicant=s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. In sufficient time has passed since his \nsecond DWI conviction to demonstrate rehabilitation, and the likelihood or recurrence \nremains significant. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under the guidelines for Criminal Conduct and Alcohol \nConsumption. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n            \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n            \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9\nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

A Chinese citizen by birth and a U.S. citizen since \n2000, Applicant met her burden to present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concern for foreign influence based on her family ties \nto China. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format) on February 25, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as \na security clearance application. After a background investigation, on July 14, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent \nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \n                                                          \n1 Exhibit 1.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline B for foreign influence due to her \nfamily ties to China, the country of her birth.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 2, 2017. She admitted the SOR \nallegations with explanations. She also requested an in-person hearing before an \nadministrative judge.   \n \nThe case was assigned to me on December 13, 2017. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on April 18, 2018. Both Department Counsel and Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Government Exhibits 1-4 and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits A-G. I took administrative or official notice, which is similar to judicial notice, of \ncertain facts concerning the country of China per Department Counsel\u2019s written \nrequest.2 The essential facts about China are discussed below. The hearing transcript \nwas received on May 3, 2018.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, a native of China, is a 56-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a \nsecurity clearance at the secret level, which was granted to her in 2006,3 for her job as \na software quality engineer. She has worked for the same aerospace company since \n2004. Before that, she worked as a software engineer for a large U.S. company. She \nhas a good employment record based on a highly favorable letter of recommendation \nfrom a technical fellow who serves as the technical lead for a team of 200 engineers.4 \nAmong other things, the letter described Applicant as a sought after software engineer \n\u201cdue to her dedication, attention to detail, and hard work.\u201d The letter also described \nApplicant as \u201ca dedicated American citizen who enjoys being active in the community \nand just wants the best for her [children].\u201d  \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from a Chinese university of science and \ntechnology in 1983. She was then employed as a software and hardware engineer. She \nlived with her parents until her marriage to a citizen of China in 1987. Applicant has \nlived in the United States since 1990, when she and her then husband came here via \nher husband\u2019s student visa so he could pursue further education. In due course, she \nbecame a permanent resident of the United States, and she obtained U.S. citizenship in \n2000. Her marriage ended in divorce in 2004. She had two children during the marriage, \nboth of whom are native-born U.S. citizens. Her 23-year-old daughter is a recent college \ngraduate who has plans to attend medical school. Her 19-year-old son is a college \nstudent who studies computer science.  \n \n \n                                                          \n2 Exhibit 4.  \n \n3 Exhibit 1; Tr. 6-7.  \n \n4 Exhibit B.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThe SOR concerns Applicant\u2019s family ties to China via her father, mother, and \ntwo sisters. These are the same family members as when Applicant was granted a \nsecurity clearance in 2006. The relevant details are set forth below. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father, now both in their 80s, came to the United States in \n2002 via Applicant\u2019s sponsorship. They were granted permanent resident status in \nNovember 2002.5 They lived with Applicant when they were not visiting their other \ndaughter in the United States. Neither speaks English, and neither was employed in the \nUnited States. It was not unusual for her parents to travel back and forth between the \nUnited States and China. They returned to China in 2012 or 2013 due to her father\u2019s \ndeclining health.6 Applicant\u2019s father has been retired for more than 20 years from his job \nas a manager for the same company she worked for in China.7 Likewise, Applicant\u2019s \nmother has been retired for more than 20 years from her job as a department-store \nmanager.8 Applicant speaks to her parents by telephone weekly. Applicant\u2019s parents are \naware that she works as a software engineer for an aerospace company, but that is the \nextent of their knowledge.9 \n \nIn addition to her parents, Applicant has two sisters who are both citizens of \nChina. One sister lives in the United States and has been a permanent resident since \n2011.10 Her sister has a job working in a college library. Her sister\u2019s husband is \nemployed as a professor at the same college. Another sister lives in China, and she is \nemployed as a civil engineer for a Chinese engineering firm.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial interests are here with the exception of a bank account in \nChina. In addition to her annual salary, Applicant has the following financial assets in \nthe United States: (1) her home with a market value of about $400,000 with a mortgage \nloan balance of about $100,000; (2) a 401(k) account with a balance of about $700,000 \nto $800,000; (3) two residential rental properties which are unencumbered by mortgage \nloans; (4) approximately $250,000 in IRA accounts; and (5) $75,000 to $100,000 in \nbank accounts.11 She opened a bank account in China sometime after her parents \nreturn in the event she wanted to provide financial assistance to them.12 She made an \ninitial deposit of about $25,000 to $30,000, and has since made no further deposits. The \n                                                          \n5 Exhibits D and E.  \n \n6 Tr. 51.  \n \n7 Tr. 47.  \n \n8 Tr. 48.  \n \n9 Tr. 53-54.  \n \n10 Exhibit F.  \n \n11 Tr. 62-69.  \n \n12 Tr. 57-59.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \naccount is in her name, but her parents have a debit or ATM card to access the account \nif necessary.  \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has been accused of or cited for a security \ninfraction or security violation since granted eligibility in 2006. Likewise, there is no \nevidence that she has otherwise mishandled sensitive or classified information or failed \nto perform security-related duties or responsibilities. At the hearing, she expressed a \ngood understanding of security-related matters.13  \n \nConcerning the country of China, Department Counsel\u2019s request for \nadministrative notice contains an extensive discussion of the security concerns \nassociated with China. The most pertinent of those facts are the following: (1) China is \nan authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount authority; \n(2) China (along with Russia) is the most aggressive collector of intelligence (both \nindustrial and military) related to U.S. information and technology; and (3) China has a \npoor record of human rights regarding respect for the integrity of the person, respect for \ncivil liberties, respect for political rights, corruption and lack of transparency in \ngovernment, worker rights, as well as discrimination, societal abuses, and human \ntrafficking. The maltreatment and oppression of the people in Tibet is but one example \nof China\u2019s poor human-rights record.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.14 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.15 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d16 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.17 The Appeal Board has \n                                                          \n13 Tr. 56-57.  \n \n14 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n15 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n16 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n17 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n \n5 \n \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.18 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.19 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.20 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.21 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.22 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.23 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.24 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nThe gravamen of the SOR under Guideline B for foreign influence is whether \nApplicant\u2019s ties to China should disqualify her from access to classified information. \nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence,25 the suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern \nunder the guideline is: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n                                                          \n18 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n \n19 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n20 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n21 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n22 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n23 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n24 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n25 AG \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7, and 8 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.26 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology.  \n \n \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of China. Suffice it to say, the \nU.S. Government views the behavior of the Chinese government as presenting a \nserious national security concern, and the heightened-risk element is satisfied too. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s family ties to China, the Government has established its case under \nGuideline B. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence.  \n \n \nThe guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign \ninfluence concerns. Given the evidence here, I considered the following mitigating \nconditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \n                                                          \n26 AG \u00b6 6.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.  \n \n \nChina\u2019s relationship with the United States and the heightened risk it presents \nplace a heavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With that said, \nApplicant has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy \nperson. She was serious, candid, and credible at the hearing. She appears to have \ncooperated fully and provided truthful information about her family ties to China during \nthe security clearance process. She made a good impression upon me during the \nhearing.  \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to China. Applicant came to the \nUnited States more than 25 years ago in 1990, and she has since established and \nmade her life here. She has a long employment record in the United States, she gave \nbirth to two children in the United States, and her adult children are pursing their lives \nand educations in the United States. In addition to her children, she has a sister who \nlives and works in the United States as well as a brother-in-law. Her parents resided in \nthe United States for about a decade until returning to China for health reasons in about \n2012 or 2013. Her financial assets, which are substantial, are in the United States \nexcept for a bank account in China she established to assist her parents. The value and \nroutine nature of her Chinese bank account is such that it is unlikely to pose a conflict, \nand it is unlikely to be used to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant. AG \u00b6 8(f) is \napplicable. \n \n \nOther than her parents return to China, little has changed since Applicant was \nfavorably adjudicated for a security clearance in 2006. Applicant has since had more \ntime to establish her ties and connections to the United States, and to demonstrate that \nshe adheres to security rules and requirements for her employment with a defense \ncontractor. Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Chinese government or her family members who \nhave Chinese citizenship. I further conclude there is no conflict of interest, because \nApplicant has developed such deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States that she can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in the \nfavor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on March 11, 2016. \nOn June 19, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines G and J. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order (Ex.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on November \n1, 2017, and the case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 21, 2018, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 5, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 6 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on June 13, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleges that Applicant consumed alcohol to the point \nof intoxication from about 1991/1992 to at least January 2016, and that this excessive \nconsumption resulted in five arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), two \nof which resulted in 12 months\u2019 probation, and that Applicant received alcohol-related \ntreatment for a condition diagnosed as alcohol-use disorder. Applicant denies the \ncharacterization of his alcohol consumption. He admits the DUI arrests, but denies that \nhe was intoxicated during the incidents. Applicant also denies that he was sentenced to \nprobation as a result of his December 2015 DUI arrest. However, he admits that he was \nsentenced to 12 months\u2019 probation following his February 2016 DUI arrest. He admits \nthat he successfully underwent alcohol-related treatment. The SOR cross-alleges under \nGuideline J, the alcohol-related arrests. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old avionics supervisor employed by a defense contractor \nsince May 2014, and previously employed by another defense contractor beginning in \nDecember 2009. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 1989 until he \nretired in August 2010. He deployed to a combat zone during Operation Desert Storm. \nHe has held a security clearance since approximately 1990. Applicant has a teenage \ndaughter. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 26.)  \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol in 1991 while assigned to an aircraft carrier, but \ndid drink not to the point of intoxication or have any alcohol-related issues during the \n1990s. In February 2006, Applicant had been drinking and was pulled over for speeding. \n(Tr. 40.) At the stop, Applicant refused to perform field sobriety tests or take a breathalyzer \nat the officer\u2019s direction, but instead requested a blood test. He was arrested for DUI, \nspeeding, no insurance, and no seatbelt. The DUI charge was reduced to reckless driving \nand ultimately dismissed.  \n \nIn December 2010, Applicant was pulled over for speeding. The officer asked \nApplicant if he had been drinking, Applicant denied that he had been, and refused a \nbreathalyzer. He was arrested and charged with DUI and speeding. Ultimately, the DUI \ncharge was dismissed, the related court costs were waived, and Applicant paid a fine for \nspeeding.  \n \nIn January 2015, Applicant was pulled over on an Army base for speeding. The \nofficer stated in his report that Applicant smelled strongly of alcohol. However, Applicant \n\n \n3\nhas consistently stated that he had not been drinking. (Answer; Tr. 31; Tr. 41; Tr. 46.) \nApplicant refused a breathalyzer, and was arrested for DUI and speeding. He was \ndetained for approximately 14 hours, then released. The DUI charge was later dismissed \nand Applicant paid a $10 fine for speeding. (GX 5; Answer.) Applicant testified that he \nhad several run-ins with arresting officer of the incident on the Army base. He reported \nthe officer\u2019s conduct to the commanding officer, but ultimately Applicant decided to move \noff base to avoid future issues. Applicant believes that the officer was confusing Applicant \nwith someone else. (Tr. 45-46.) \n \n \nIn December 2015, Applicant was pulled over for speeding while on the way to the \nhospital to visit his girlfriend. After the stop, the officer stated that he had seen Applicant \nthrow drugs from the vehicle. Applicant denied this and demanded to see the footage \nfrom the officer\u2019s dashboard mounted camera. The officer refused. Applicant was arrested \nand charged with DUI, speeding, illegal lane change, no insurance, and no registration. \nApplicant denies that he consumed any alcohol prior to the arrest. At Applicant\u2019s fourth \ncourt appearance, the officer was not present and Applicant\u2019s attorney stated that all \ncharges would be suspended and later dismissed if Applicant pled guilty and completed \na pre-trial diversion program and paid a $3,600 fine. Applicant did not enter the \nagreement, but instead, requested a jury trial. At the pretrial conference, all charges \nexcept for the speeding were dismissed. (Answer.) \n \n \nIn February 2016, Applicant was in a rental car in a friend\u2019s driveway. He had been \ndrinking the night before and there was an empty cup in the car which had contained a \nnon-alcoholic daiquiri. His friend noticed the vehicle, which she did not recognize, and \ncalled the police. The police arrived, and after speaking with Applicant and noting the \napparent open container, asked Applicant to take a breathalyzer. Applicant refused and \nwas arrested for DUI. Applicant pled no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to \n12 months\u2019 probation, which required Applicant to abstain from alcohol use, attend alcohol \nawareness classes with random urinalysis, and complete 50 hours of community service. \nApplicant successfully completed the requirements and was released from probation in \nJune 2017. (Answer.) \n \n \n \nThree days after his last DUI arrest in February 2016, Applicant self-referred to the \nArmy Substance Abuse Program (ASAP). He was evaluated by a counselor who stated \nthat Applicant met the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder (Moderate). He was assessed as \nnot needing medical detoxification or inpatient treatment. Applicant entered outpatient \ntreatment and counseling and \u201cmet his treatment goal of establishing and maintaining \nabstinence while increasing his knowledge about the disease of addiction in the process \nof recovery.\u201d He successfully completed the treatment requirements which included \nattending Alcohol Anonymous (AA) meetings, and, in May 2016, received a fair to good \nprognosis. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant has abstained from alcohol consumption since February 2016, four \nmonths before beginning probation. Despite his denials that he had been drinking prior to \nseveral of his DUI arrests, Applicant admits that he had been drinking before the 2006 \nand 2016 arrests, and that consuming alcohol has created problems in his life. (Tr. 40-\n\n \n4\n43; Answer.) Applicant has no other criminal history. He strives to continually set an \nexample for his teenage daughter through his actions. (Tr. 23-24; 39.) He is active in his \nchurch, and coaches Little League basketball and football. (Tr. 36.) He is working towards \nhis bachelor\u2019s degree, regularly works out at a gym, and continues to attend AA meetings \ntwo to three times a week. (Tr. 37-38; AX A.) He has no intention of drinking alcohol in \nthe future. (Tr. 38.)  \n \nApplicant accepts full responsibility for his actions. He is dedicated to his job. \nApplicant\u2019s two fellow service members and friends since 1991, and a current coworker \nsince 2011 attest to Applicant\u2019s strength of character, integrity, and trustworthiness, and \nhighly recommend him for a continued security clearance. (AX A.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n5\n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6\nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \n \nApplicant began drinking in 1991, but did not have any alcohol-related issues until \nhis first DUI arrest in 2006. Between 2006 and 2016, Applicant was arrested five times \nfor DUI, and admits that he had been drinking on two of those occasions. Immediately \nfollowing his last DUI arrest in February 2016, Applicant quit drinking and self-referred to \nASAP, which he successfully completed with a fair to good prognosis in May 2016. He \nrecognizes that his alcohol use was problematic. He remains abstinent, attends AA \nmeetings two to three times a week, and does not intend to drink in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n23(b) and 23(d) apply. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n\n \n7\nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DUI arrests occurred during a period of time when he was actively using \nalcohol. He has not had any arrests or charges since achieving sobriety in February 2016. \nHe self-referred to ASAP, successfully completed probation, and continues to voluntarily \nparticipate in AA. He is dedicated to his job, and is pursuing his bachelor\u2019s degree. He \ncontinually strives to be a role model for his daughter, and is active in his church and \ncommunity His past conduct does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant served in the Navy for over 21 years, including a combat deployment. \nHe has held a security clearance for more than 27 years. Applicant has taken positive \nsteps, including cessation of alcohol use since February 2016. He has sought ongoing \nsupport for his sobriety by attending AA. He has clearly demonstrated his commitment to \nreform and rehabilitation. He is respected and trusted by his long-time friends and \ncoworkers. He is pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree. He accepts responsibility of his past \nconduct, and is committed to his sobriety, his family, and his job.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and \nJ, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for continued access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

I received 18 exhibits after the hearing, which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. (AE D-AE V) The record closed on February 20, \n2019. (AE W)   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.i, and she denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k. (HE 3) She also provided \nextenuating and mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings \nof fact.  \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, and she has been employed by a defense contractor in \nworkforce planning since 2016. (Tr. 5, 8, 35; GE 1) In 1999, she graduated from high \nschool; in 1996, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree; and in 2001, she received a master\u2019s \ndegree in business administration. (Tr. 5, 7) She has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) In \n2001, she married, and in 2012, she separated from her spouse. (Tr. 6, 20) Her twins are \nage 11, and her other child is 12. (Tr. 7) She has custody of her three children, and her \nhusband is living outside of the United States. (Tr. 29) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant gave her financial information to her husband\u2019s father who was supposed \nto file her income tax returns. (Tr. 21) When her father-in-law filed the tax returns, he filed \nmarried separate, and he allocated the deductions to her husband. (Tr. 21, 42-43; GE 1) \nWhen she received correspondence from the IRS, she gave the documentation to her \nfather-in-law, and she believed he was handling filing of necessary tax returns for her in \ngood faith. (Tr. 22) She believed her husband was going to pay her share of the taxes \nbecause he was using the deductions. (Tr. 23; GE 1) She believed that the tax lien was \na marital debt, and thus, her husband was responsible for half of the debt. (Tr. 24) \nApplicant\u2019s husband was arrested on multiple occasions for domestic violence, and on \none occasion, he knocked out some of Applicant\u2019s teeth. (Tr. 31) She made 12 Child \nProtective Services (CPS) complaints against him, and he does not visit their children. \n(Tr. 31) When her husband left, he took the funds from their retirement accounts. (Tr. 40) \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nHer September 8, 2012 separation agreement indicated Applicant and her husband had \nto file a consent order to have their mutual protective orders against each other dismissed. \n(AE V at 17) Applicant recently obtained a second job to enable her to pay her debts. (AE \nL) See also GE 1, Section 22 (indicating in August 2012 Applicant\u2019s husband obtained \nher arrest for trespass, disturbing the peace, and assault). \n \nIn 2012, Applicant was sick and unable to work outside her home for four months. \n(Tr. 34-35, 41; SOR response; GE 1) Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges the following financial \nissues. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i allege eight delinquent medical debts totaling \n$2,198 in the following amounts: $877; $674; $321; $121; $67; $35; $34; and $69. She \nsaid she paid several of the medical debts. (Tr. 31-32; AE B) Applicant paid $15,000 for \nher children\u2019s braces. (Tr. 21) She said she just paid the debt for $877. (Tr. 31-32; AE U) \nShe pays her family\u2019s medical bills as she receives them. (Tr. 32) \n \nAfter her hearing, Applicant provided a printout of her healthcare claims and \npayment activity from August 2016 to January 2019. (AE U) The chart listed \napproximately 140 payments to medical creditors. Many of the payments were made \nusing a credit card and the source of the claim is not indicated on the printout. Several \nsubstantial payments are from a health savings account. (AE U) The following table \nshows a sample of some of the payments for medical and orthodontic bills she made from \nDecember 2017 to January 2019.   \n \nDate of \nPayment \nAmount of \nPayment \nExhibit \nDate of \nPayment \nAmount of \nPayment \nExhibit \nDec. 7, 2017 \n$1,119 \nAE U at 5 \nAug. 9, 2018 \n$243 \nAE U at 2 \nDec. 7, 2017 \n$1,119 \nAE U at 5 \nAug. 16, 2018 \n$185 \nAE U at 2 \nJan. 7, 2018 \n$2,650 \nAE U at 5 \nAug. 26, 2018 \n$185 \nAE U at 2 \nMar. 1, 2018 \n$271 \nAE U at 5  \nAug. 29, 2018 \n$194 \nAE U at 2 \nMar. 25, 2018 $323 \nAE U at 4 \nNov. 27, 2018 \n$34 \nAE U at 2 \nApr. 13, 2018  $119 \nAE U at 4 \nJan. 10, 2018 \n$975 \nAE U at 1 \nApr. 13, 2018 \n$597 \nAE U at 4 \nJan. 24, 2019 \n$133 \nAE S at 1 \nJune 28, 2018 $80 \nAE U at 3 \nJan. 24, 2019 \n$476 \nAE S at 2 \nJuly 21, 2018 \n$489 \nAE U at 3 \nJan. 24, 2019 \n$34 \nAE T at 1 \nJuly 21, 2018 \n$50 \nAE U at 3 \nJan. 24, 2019 \n$1,081 \nAE T at 2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s September 8, 2012 separation agreement indicated Applicant\u2019s \nhusband was required to maintain health insurance for Applicant and their three children \nso long as it was available at reasonable cost through his employer. (AE V at 11, 13) \nUnreimbursed medical, dental, and orthodontic expenses for each minor child were \nrequired to be paid in direct proportion to each party\u2019s share of their combined gross \nincome. (AE V at 12) His separation agreement required him to pay some of the other \nfamily bills; however, he only made sporadic payments. (Tr. 30) She has attempted to \nconvince her husband to pay some of the medical debts. (AE M) Applicant acted \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nreasonably and responsibly in the overall resolution of her medical and dental debts, and \nshe mitigated SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a tax lien filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2012 \nfor $28,188. A copy of the tax lien is not part of the record, and it is unclear which tax year \nor years were addressed with this lien. The lien appears to be for tax years 2008 and \n2011 based on the IRS tax transcripts which show transfers of refunds to those two tax \nyears. (AE F; AE G) Applicant\u2019s September 8, 2012 separation agreement indicated \nApplicant and her husband were responsible for joint debts incurred prior to May 2012, \nand Applicant has a good faith argument that her husband is jointly responsible for half \nof her tax debts for tax years 2008 and 2011.

(AE G) In March 2011, the IRS \nassessed $15,590 in additional taxes for tax year 2008 and over the next seven years, \nabout $10,000 in penalties and interest. (AE G) Her federal income tax refunds for tax \nyears 2012 ($16,262) and 2013 ($1,024) were applied to this debt. (AE G) On August 31, \n                                            \n1 Applicant may have miscalculated the child and dependent care credit.

(AE Q)  \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \n2018, she paid the IRS $4,701, and the IRS credited her with paying her tax debt on her \ntax transcript for tax year 2008. (AE G)  \n \nApplicant did not owe any federal income taxes for tax years 2009, 2010, 2012, \n2013, and 2014. (Tr. 25-26; AE F) Applicant timely filed her 2011 federal income tax \nreturn; however, she owed about $3,500 at the time she filed her tax return. (AE F) On \nAugust 31, 2018, the IRS transferred a $490 credit from tax year 2008, and on October \n5, 2018, she paid $4,230, resolving her tax debt for tax year 2011. (AE F; AE G)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges Applicant failed to file or pay her federal income taxes as \nrequired for tax years 2012 through 2015. She said she filed her 2013 and 2014 federal \nincome tax returns sometime before she responded to the SOR; however, she did not \nspecify when she filed them. (Tr. 25-26; SOR response) In November 2017, Applicant \npaid the IRS $14,504. (AE C) At the time of her hearing, she had not filed her tax returns \nfor tax years 2015 and 2016 because she needed information from her husband to file \nher tax returns. (Tr. 25-27) She wanted to be sure that she correctly filed all needed \ninformation for her tax returns. (Tr. 26-27)2 She met with a divorce lawyer in 2014; \nhowever, she had not seen a lawyer recently because she lacked funds to pay her lawyer. \n(Tr. 27) Her lawyer told her not to file the tax returns. (Tr. 27) Her lawyer said she needed \nto consult someone knowledgeable about taxes before doing anything. (Tr. 27-28) The \nfirst certified public accountant (CPA) she consulted wanted $5,000 before he would \nadvise her on what she should do. (Tr. 28) Her husband said he filed his tax returns. (Tr. \n29) He is outside the country working for the U.S. Government, and he refused to give \nher information or assist her. (Tr. 29) He did not believe a court would be able to force \nhim to cooperate with her because he is out of the country. (Tr. 29)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges Applicant failed to file or pay her state income taxes as required \nfor tax years 2012 through 2015. \n \nOn December 21, 2018, I asked Applicant to provide copies of her federal and \nstate tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2016.3 If the tax returns are undated, I asked \nher to disclose when they were filed. Her \u201cfinal suspense\u201d was January 25, 2019.  \n \n                                            \n2 The Internal Revenue Service may reject an inaccurate return. See IRS website, \nhttps://www.irs.gov/faqs/electronic-filing-e-file. Applicant filed her tax returns using a commercial electronic \nsoftware program. (AE N-AE Q) Applicant attempted to file her 2015 federal income tax return on April 18, \n2016, (the date it was due) electronically; however, the IRS rejected her electronic return without specifying \nthe reason(s). (AE Q) Electronic returns are not accepted by the IRS after November of the year they are \ndue. (IRS website) The proper recourse after a return is rejected is to contact the IRS, and then the IRS \nmay instruct the caller to file the return manually. Applicant provided a 2015 federal income tax return dated \nDecember 1, 2018, which was manually signed. (AE Q) When tax information is unavailable, the taxpayer \nis supposed to provide a good-faith estimate and disclose the estimation to the IRS. See American Institute \nof Certified Public Accountants website, \u201cStandards for Tax Services No. 4, Use of Estimates,\u201d   \nhttps://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/tax/resources/standardsethics/statementsonstandardsfortaxservices/\ndownloadabledocuments/ssts-no.4-use-of-estimates.pdf.  \n \n3 Copies of email communications from and to Applicant are the source for the information in this \nparagraph and the next three paragraphs.

From 2012 on. I cannot get onto \nthe IRS website to get the filing dates for the ones prior to 2015 because I \nchanged my phone number and that's how the[y] verify. I need to have a \nnew code mailed to access the online website to see my transcripts. I've \nbeen calling and cannot get through. I would assume that's due to the shut \ndown. I'll call again in the morning. 2015 and 2016 were mailed in Dec. \n \nApplicant provided her federal and state tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013, and \n2014, and she provided her federal tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. On January \n27, 2019, I asked Applicant to provide copies of her federal and state tax returns for tax \nyear 2017. I also asked her to provide copies of her state tax returns for 2015 and 2016. \nI noted that many of the tax returns she previously provided are undated, and I asked her \nto disclose when they were filed.4 Her suspense to submit documentation was February \n20, 2019. I did not receive a response to my January 27, 2019 email.    \n \nIn November 2017, Applicant paid a credit card debt for $5,272. (AE A) On \nDecember 12, 2018, she sent $5,000 to the IRS to ensure the IRS had ample funds to \naddress any income tax she owed. (AE L) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n                                            \n4 An Applicant\u2019s failure to provide requested, available tax documentation, including IRS-generated \nfederal income tax transcripts, can undermine mitigation of tax debts. See ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018). \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) \na history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns as required . . . .\u201d SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i allege and \ncredit reports establish eight delinquent medical debts totaling $2,198, and she had a \nfederal income tax lien entered against her for $28,188. Applicant admitted that she failed \nto timely file several state and federal tax returns. She did not provide proof that her state \ntax returns were filed as of February 20, 2019 for tax years 2015 and 2016. The \nGovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \nSeven mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;5   \n                                            \n5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNo mitigating conditions fully apply to her failure to timely file and pay her federal \nand state income taxes; however, Applicant presented some important mitigating \ninformation about her finances. Several circumstances that were partially or fully beyond \nher control adversely affected her finances or filing of tax returns: (1) she was ill and \nunable to work for four months in 2012; (2) she was repeatedly assaulted by her husband; \n(3) her father-in-law was supposed to file her tax returns and did not do so; (4) her \nhusband did not pay his share of marital debts; (5) her husband left the United States and \nenforcement of the separation agreement was not feasible; (6) her husband did not \nprovide documentation or information to assist her in filing her tax returns; and (7) these \nmultiple factors cumulatively caused her delinquent debts or distracted her from taking \ncare of her finances, especially her federal and state income taxes for several years. \n \nApplicant acted reasonably and responsibly in the overall resolution of her medical \nand dental debts. She showed numerous payments towards her family\u2019s medical or dental \ndebts.

SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a tax lien filed by the IRS in 2012 for \n$28,188. In addition to wage withholding, in 2018, Applicant paid the IRS $28,931. \nApplicant is credited with paying the tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \n \nApplicant filed her federal income tax returns for tax year 2016 after her hearing.6 \nShe did not provide proof that she filed her state income tax returns for 2015 and 2016. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the \napplicant\u2019s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent \nsuch problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness in light of [applicant\u2019s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing \n                                            \n6 Applicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that she did not timely file her federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2016 and 2017. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal \nBoard listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \nId.

On \nJanuary 27, 2019, I emailed Applicant and requested a copy of her 2017 federal and state income tax \nreturns; however, she may not have received my January 27, 2019 email. No adverse inference is drawn \nfrom her failure to provide her 2017 federal and state income tax returns. She received my request for her \nfederal and state tax returns for tax year 2016, and she did provide her federal tax return for tax year 2016 \n(signed on December 1, 2019). Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for \ntax year 2016 will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nirresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01031 at 3 and n. 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d \napproach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d \nanalysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus \non timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nApplicant repeatedly failed to timely file her state and federal income tax returns. \nAs of February 20, 2019, the date the record closed, she did not provide proof that she \nfiled her state tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, and she has been employed by a defense contractor in \nworkforce planning since 2016. In 1996, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree, and in 2001, \nshe received a master\u2019s degree in business administration. In 2001, she married, and in \n2012, she separated from her spouse. She has custody of her three children, and her \nhusband is living outside the United States.  \n \nSeveral circumstances partially or fully beyond Applicant\u2019s control adversely \naffected her finances. She acted reasonably and responsibly in the overall resolution of \nher medical and dental debts, and she is credited with mitigating the financial allegations \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i. She is also credited with paying the tax lien alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.h. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of failing to timely file her federal and state income tax returns \nraises unresolved financial considerations security concerns. She may owe state income \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \ntaxes for tax years 2015 and 2016.7 When an issue of delinquent taxes is involved, an \nadministrative judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to file their tax \nreturns, whether the IRS or a state generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant \nwaits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making payments.8 The primary \nproblem here is that Applicant has repeatedly been late filing her tax returns, and she did \nnot provide proof that she filed her state tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. \n  \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true financial reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible \nfor a security clearance. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for \na security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the \nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. This decision should \nnot be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of \nreform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. In the future, with a track \nrecord of addressing her delinquent financial obligations and timely filing tax returns and \npaying taxes, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security \nclearance worthiness.    \n \n I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nFinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \n \n \n                                            \n7 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents \nan obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d). \n \n8 See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance \nand stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only \nafter his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd.

Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and \ninsufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and \ncited applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns \nfor tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except \nfor $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income \nof over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse\u2019s medical \nproblems. The Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first \nplace stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and \nsystems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

He presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concern stemming from his delinquent state taxes, his failure to \ntimely file state and federal tax returns, and his delinquent debts. Accordingly, this case \nis decided for Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 27, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that \nhis circumstances raised security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 15, 2017, and requested a hearing to \nestablish his eligibility for continued access to classified information.1 \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here.    \n03/27/2019\n\n2 \n \n \n \n \nUpon due notice to Applicant, on August 2, 2018, a hearing was convened. The \ntranscript (Tr. No. 1) of that initial hearing was received on August 10, 2018. Applicant \nappeared and explained that he had just recently completed some domestic relations \nhearings and had used his financial resources and time taking care of that matter. \nApplicant also indicated that he was considering retaining counsel or at least consulting \nwith counsel for this hearing. Without objection, I granted a continuance of about six \nweeks.2  \n \n  \nUpon due notice to Applicant, the hearing was reconvened on September 12, \n2018. Applicant testified, and the exhibits offered by the Government were admitted into \nthe record without objection. (Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 6 and Hearing Exhibits (HE) \nI and II were admitted without objection.) Applicant offered five exhibits, Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted without objection. At the request of \nApplicant, without objection, the record remained open until September 26, 2018. \nApplicant timely submitted four documents, which I marked as AE F through AE I and \nwere admitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the reconvened hearing was \nreceived on September, 20, 2018.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, a college graduate with some post-graduate work, and \nhas been divorced since 2014.

Although \nhe was not supposed to spend the nights, he often did so anyway.6  \n \nIn early 2013, Applicant, his mother, and his grandmother moved to a rental house. \nThat lodging was barely adequate and ultimately developed utility problems.7 Since \nApplicant remained unemployed, he could take his mother to her dialysis three days a \nweek and help care for his paralyzed grandmother, as well. They lived there in 2013 and \n2014. Applicant\u2019s mother died in January 2015, and his grandmother died six months \nlater.8 \n \nAfter his grandmother died, Applicant moved to an efficiency appartment at a \nnearby college where he was doing part-time work. The college allowed him to live there \nrent-free. He lived there until August 2015, when he moved to a college-owned two \nbedroom apartment, again rent-free. Applicant is still living there.9 \n \nApplicant has had numerous periods of unemployment that have impaired his \nability to recover fully from his financial difficulties. His periods of unemployment were as \nfollows: November 2017 to June 2018; October 2015 to April or May 2016; August 2014 \nto December 2014; March 2014 to June 2014; May 2013 to January 2014.

He also admitted \nthat he is indebted to the state for income taxes in the amount of $3,140 (SOR \u00b61.c) but \nthat he is on a payment plan that is current.13 \n \nApplicant testified at length about why he failed to timely file his income tax returns. \nWhen his spouse ousted him from the family home in 2011, he had no access to the \n                                                          \n6 GE 1; Tr. 49-51, 63.

Until then, all of his paperwork was \u201cscattered. \n. . all over the place, or thrown away.\u201d14 \n \nApplicant testified about his current plan to pay delinquent debts now that he is \nfully employed again. He is working with a credit repair company. Applicant has three \naccounts in which he deposits his pay. In one account, he deposits about one-third of his \npay. That one-third is used for his everyday bills. The remaining two-thirds goes into two \nother accounts.  One is a savings account for emergencies, and the other is used to pay \nhis back bills. He received legal advice on how to structure these accounts.15  \n \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b61.d (a charge-off for $21,149 for a repossessed auto), \nbecause he has disputed the amount due.16 He provided documentation of that dispute.17 \n \n Applicant denied SOR \u00b61.e (child support of $2,377), because he currently has \nlegal custody of his sons and owes no back child support.

He answered that he \nreceived credit counseling and came up with an installment plan for this debt. Applicant \ndocumented his counseling but did not provide any evidence of a payment plan or his \nadherence to a plan.20 \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b61.h (a collection account for $300).

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n21 Answer, pp. 6-7. That debt does not appear on the most recent credit reports (GE 4; GE 5). It was last \nreported on August 20, 2016. GE 6.  \n\n6 \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has had financial problems, which purportedly \nraise a security concern under Guideline F. The financial considerations security concern \nis explained at AG \u00b6 18, which in pertinent part, states: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  \n \n Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial \nissues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality \nto pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to \ndelinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person\u2019s \nself-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.22 \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following pertinent disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal [or] state . . . income tax returns  \n \nor failure to pay annual . . . state . . . income tax as required; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n                                                          \n22 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).  \n \n\n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection process. Rather, my \nobligation is to examine the way an applicant handles personal financial obligations to \nassess how he may handle his security obligations.23 Here, Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility was called into question by his failure to timely file his state and Federal income \ntax returns, pay his state income tax obligation, and by his level of delinquent consumer \ndebt. I conclude that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f) apply. The next \ninquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nThe record is clear that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by a parade of \nhorrible conditions, any one or more of which would severely test the financial stability of \nany individual. There is no need for a detailed recap of what is made clear in the findings \nof fact. In sum, Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR and his testimony showed that his financial \nproblems were largely caused by: (1) an acrimonious divorce and custody dispute; (2) \nserious illnesses suffered by Applicant\u2019s mother (on dialysis three days a week) and his \ngrandmother (paralysis); (3) several periods of unemployment caused by conditions \nbeyond his control, and in part by the need for Applicant to care for his mother and \ngrandmother; (4) Applicant being ousted from his home by his then spouse in late 2011; \n(5) using what time and resources Applicant had on the custody battle for his two sons; \n(6) Applicant being homeless periodically. I find that the allegations in the SOR are \nmitigated by AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through (e), and (g).  \n \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.24 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion \n                                                          \n23 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 31, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on February \n13, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on February 15, 2018, scheduling the hearing for March 21, 2018. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. GX 5 was admitted for Administrative Notice as to \nthe Philippines. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered two documents, which I \nmarked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A and B and admitted into evidence. The record \n\n \n2 \n \nwas left open until April 23, 2018, for receipt of additional documentation. Applicant \nsubmitted nothing further. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on March \n29, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 20 line \n22 to page 21 line 13, and GX 1 at page 5.) He has been employed with the defense \ncontractor \u201csince July of 2017.\u201d (TR at page 20 line 22 to page 21 line 13.) He is married \nto a Philippine national; and has three children, the two eldest living with his former \nspouse in the United States. (TR at page 20 lines 18~21, and GX 1 at pages 46~47 and \n53.) His youngest child resides in the Philippines with the child mother, Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent wife. Applicant resides in the United States. \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant attributes his admitted financial difficulties to brief periods of \nunemployment, the one \u201cstarted May 31, 2017, to July 17, 2017.\u201d (TR at page 34 lines \n1~10.)  \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt in the amount of about $7,291, \nas the result of a breach of contract with a former employer. (TR at page 21 line 21 to \npage 25 line 6.) Through a credit counseling service, Applicant is making monthly \npayments of $134 towards this admitted debt, as evidenced by documentation from that \ncounseling service. (AppX A at page1 and AppX B at page 1.) This allegation is found \nfor Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. and 1.f. Applicant admits that he has two past-due debts with the \nDepartment of Education totaling about $3,672. (TR at page 25 line 7 to page 27 line 2.) \nIn August and September of 2017, Applicant was trying to make monthly payments of \nonly $5 towards this admitted debt. (Id, and AppX A at page 2 and AppX B at pages \n2~3.) This documentation also shows that Applicant was \u201cpast due\u201d $5 on his payments. \n(Id.) Despite having a month to do so, Applicant has submitted nothing further in this \nregard. (TR at page 42 line 23 to page 43 line 19.) These allegations are found against \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.c.  Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt in the amount of about $1,747 \nto Creditor C. (TR at page 27 line 3 to page 28 line 10.) Through a credit counseling \nservice, Applicant is making monthly payments of $88 towards this admitted debt, as \nevidenced by documentation from that counseling service. (AppX A at page1 and AppX \nB at page 1.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admits that he had a past-due debt with Creditor D in the amount \nof about $696, but avers that this \u201cphone bill account . . . was paid off.\u201d (TR at page 28 \n\n \n3 \n \nline 11 to page 29 line 8.) Despite having a month to do so, Applicant has submitted \nnothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admits that he had past-due child support payments totaling about \n$7,747. In August of 2017, this was being paid through wage garnishment. (TR at page \n29 line 9 to page 31 line 14, and AppX at page 3 and AppX B at pages 4~5.) Despite \nhaving a month to do so, Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard. This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \nNot alleged; but admitted to by Applicant at his hearing, he is a month past due \non a car payment, and owes about $800 in state back taxes. (TR at page 32 line 3 to \npage 36 line 2.) \n \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \n \n \n2.a, 2.b., and 2.d. Applicant\u2019s current spouse is a citizen and resident of the \nPhilippines. She hopes to immigrate to the United States. Their four-year-old American \nson resides with Applicant\u2019s spouse. Applicant provides financial support of about $600 \nevery few months to his spouse. She lives with her parents. (TR at page 20 line 4~21, at \npage 37 line 18 to page 40 line 17.) \n \n \n2.c. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of the \nPhilippines. (TR at page 41 line 18 to page 42 line 3.) They know little about Applicant\u2019s \nemployment, only that he is \u201ca mechanic . . . [who does] work for the Military.\u201d (Id.) \n \n \n2.e. In 2012, over five years ago, Applicant gave a one-time gift of about $500 to \na female friend in the Philippines. (TR at page 40 line 18 to page 41 line 17.) Their \nrelationship was terminated years ago. (Id.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nI take Administrative Notice of the following facts regarding the Philippines: It is a \nmultiparty, constitutional republic with a bicameral legislature. However, dynastic \npolitical families continue to monopolize elective offices. The U.S. Department of State \nadvises all U.S. citizens traveling to the Philippines to exercise caution due to crime, \nterrorism, and civil unrest. (GX 5 at pages 3~5.) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n\n \n4 \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n \n5 \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due debt to private companies, and to Federal and \nstate agencies. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. \nMitigation has not been established. Financial Considerations are found against \nApplicant. \n \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and in-laws are citizens and residents of the Philippines. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n \nThe Applicant\u2019s connection with his Philippine family does not outweigh his \nallegiance to the United States. His wife hopes to immigrate to the United States with \ntheir child. Foreign Influence is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant failed to timely file his \n2013, 2014, and 2015 Federal income tax returns and his 2015 state income tax return. \nThe Statement of Reasons (SOR) listed two student loan obligations of approximately \n$27,000 and three charged-off accounts totaling approximately $750. He has filed his tax \nreturns and received sizable refunds. He paid his charged-off accounts and is current on \nhis student loan obligation. He has made sufficient progress toward resolving his past-\ndue debts to continue his security clearance eligibility. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and explaining why it was unable \n03/05/2019\n\n \n2 \nto find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for him.1  \n \nOn June 30, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On February 7, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on February 27, 2018. At the hearing, six Government exhibits (Ex. \n1-6) and eleven Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-K) were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Records submitted by Applicant as attachments to his answer were considered. \nApplicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 7, 2018. I held the \nrecord open after the hearing for Applicant to submit additional documents which were \nreceived through January 2019, and were admitted into the record as Ex. L \u2013 AG.  \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective \u201cfor \nall covered individuals\u201d on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility under the new AGs.2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied the allegations of failing to file his \nFederal tax returns in a timely manner (SOR 1.a), failing to file his state income tax returns \nin a timely manner (SOR 1.b), and denied owing a gas utility bill (SOR 1.g), which he \nasserted he had paid. He admitted the remaining four delinquent obligation allegations. \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old senior software engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since February 2015. (Tr. 39, Tr. 18) He seeks to obtain a security clearance. \n(Ex. 1) He previously held a clearance from 2005 to 2015, with a different defense \ncompany. (Tr. 19) He honorably served in the U.S. Navy from July 1994 through June \n1995. (Ex. 1, Tr. 18) He is married and has a son age 19 and twins aged 17. (Ex. 1) In \nMay 1999, he obtained a bachelor-of-science degree in computer science. (Tr. 19) \nApplicant\u2019s monthly income after taxes is $4,800 to $5,000. (Tr. 48) His wife\u2019s income \n                                                          \n1 The DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, \n2006. \n \n2 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in \nthis case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf. \n  \n\n \n3 \nvaries. His wife operated her own business making craft items sold at craft shows. (Tr. \n27, 48) \n \n In 2011, Applicant made a job-related relocation from Texas to Florida. (Tr. 54) In \nFebruary 2015, Applicant made another job-related relocation from Florida to his current \nstate. (Ex. 1, Ex. E, Tr.25) On June 26, 2017, he filed a 2015 part-year resident state \nincome tax return. (Ex. E, AE) He listed $61,439 state income, $2,666 of state withholding \ntax, and a refund due of $2,613. (Ex. E) \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s September 2015 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), he indicated he had not filed his 2013 Federal income tax return \nbecause he could not locate all the documentation he needed to file the return. (Ex. 1) In \nhis August 2015 enhanced subject interview, he indicated he had not filed his 2013 or \n2014 Federal tax returns3 because he was missing documents and planned to file the \nreturns by December 2015. (Ex. 2) His tax filings were further delayed when his tax \ndocuments were boxed up when he moved in February 2015. (Ex. 5) He was in the \nprocess of filing his returns when things became misplaced during the move. (Tr. 22)  \n \nIn November 2016, Applicant contacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about \nhis failure to file his 2013, 2014, and 2015 returns. (Tr. 30) He was granted an extension \nuntil December 2016 and told if he was unable to meet the deadline, he should continue \nworking to get his returns filed. (Ex. 5, Tr. 28) He had initially received an extension on \nthe 2013 Federal income tax filing due date, but that extension did not extend until the \nreturns were actually filed in June 2017. (Tr. 28) He did not request an extension for tax \nyear 2014 or 2015 because he believed he could do nothing with his 2014 or 2015 returns \nuntil he had filed his 2013 return. (Tr. 29)  \n \nOnce Applicant had obtained the bank statements and other missing document he \nneeded to file his 2013 return, he did so. (Tr. 30) Once his 2013 return was filed, he was \nable to complete his 2014 and 2015 returns. (Tr. 30) Applicant submitted a copy of his \n2013 Federal income tax return signed on February 1, 2017, copies of his 2014 and 2015 \nFederal income tax returns signed and dated June 26, 2017, and a copy of his 2015 state \nincome tax return signed and dated June 24, 2017. (Ex. B, C, D, E, and SOR Response4) \nHis 2015 Federal tax return listed wages of $85,152, a $9,528 business loss, $5,750 \nFederal tax withheld, and a refund due of $3,039. (Ex. B) His 2014 Federal tax return, \ndated June 26, 2017, listed wages of $83,205, an $8,998 business loss, $5,755 Federal \nincome tax withheld, and a refund due of $3,531. (Ex. C) His 2015 Federal tax return, \ndated June 26, 2017, listed wages of $97,183, a $469 business loss, $8,651 Federal \nincome tax withheld, and a refund due of $3,637. (Ex. D) He received a Federal tax \nextension for tax year 2016, and he made a timely filing of that year\u2019s returns. (Tr. 32) \n                                                          \n3 During 2013 and 2014, Applicant lived in a state that did not have personal income tax. (Ex. 1, Ex. 5) \n  \n4 The copies of Applicant\u2019s tax returns that accompanied his SOR Response were much more complete, \ncontained additional schedules and forms, and included an additional state return not included in the \ndocuments presented at the hearing.  \n\n \n4 \nApplicant used the refunds of $12,800 to pay his wife\u2019s student loan obligation and to \nmake payments on his debts. (Tr. 57) \n \nApplicant asserts he now has a better way of collecting the data he needs to file \nhis taxes. (Tr. 45) He is more vigilant and disciplined in the collection of the data. He now \nputs everything on a spreadsheet including a budget, when bills are due, and data needed \nwhen filing his tax returns. (Tr. 46) His wife pays her taxes on her business monthly. (Tr. \n48) \n \nIn April 2013, his 2005 Honda automobile was \u201ctotaled\u201d in the accident when he \nwas rear ended by an ambulance. (Tr. 21) The ambulance caved in the back end of his \nvehicle. (Tr. 21) On his e-QIP, he listed medical bills of $3,200 and incurred during the \naccident. (Ex. 1) He incurred $1,500 in medical bills for a rotator cuff injury, and his wife \nincurred $3,500 in medical bills for a dislocated disc. (Ex. 2, Tr. 21) He did not pay the \ndebts because he was waiting for settlement from the ambulance company. (Ex. 2, Tr. \n25) It took four years of working with the ambulance company\u2019s insurance company to \naddress a portion of the medical bills. (Tr. 23)  \n \nApplicant has continued making payments on his medical bills and has paid off \nnumerous medical bills. (Ex. L, N, O, X, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC) He paid more than $5,000 on \nhis wife\u2019s medical bills resulting from the automobile accident. The SOR does not list any \nmedical bills as being past due, charged-off, or in collection.  \nAt the time of the accident, Applicant owed $11,093 on his vehicle. The insurance \ncompanies paid 75% of the car\u2019s value, which was $7,800 leaving a balance owed of \n$3,293 (SOR 1.d). (Tr. 24) The SOR lists an $8 charged-off account (SOR 1.d). Applicant \nadmits he owed $3,292 on the account. In June 2017, the creditor offered to settle the \ndebt for $1,317. (SOR Response) Applicant accepted and paid the settlement offer. (Ex. \nI, Tr. 42) The debt has been paid. His February 2018 credit report lists a zero balance \nand zero past due on this debt. (Ex. 6) \nBetween 1995 and 1999, Applicant incurred student loan obligations. (Ex. 2) He \nmade regular payments on his student loans until 2002 when unemployment caused his \npayments to become irregular. (Ex. 2, Tr. 55) At some point, he stopped making payments \nuntil 2004, when he started making irregular payments. He continued making irregular \npayments until the April 2013 automobile accident. (Ex. 2, Tr. 55) In 2015, the accounts \nwere again in forbearance. He requested forbearance so he could address some medical \nbills. (Tr. 34, 35) In a February 2018, Applicant\u2019s student loan services\u2019 provided a letter \nstating his student loan forbearance had been approved. (Ex. G) His next monthly \npayment of $167 was due on May 7, 2018. (Ex. 2, Ex. G, Ex. K)  \nApplicant\u2019s April 2015 credit report lists the two student loan obligations as being \n\u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d (Ex. 3) His August 2016 credit report lists the loans as being \napproximately $900 past due. (Ex. 4) His February 2018 credit report lists, both accounts \nwith zero past due. (Ex. 6) One student loan had a balance of $2,717 with a scheduled \n$17 monthly payments and the other had a balance of $28,971 with scheduled monthly \npayments of $182. (Ex. 6) The two student loans have now been consolidated into a \n\n \n5 \nsingle loan with monthly payments of $207. (Tr. 33) He provided documentation of timely \npayments of his $207 student loan payments through January 2019. (Ex. S, T, W, AD, \nAF) \nApplicant\u2019s April 2015 credit report, lists 15 accounts as being paid as agreed that \nincludes two student loans. (Ex. 3) The report also showed the auto loan on the wrecked \nHonda was listed as $2,675 past due. His most recent credit report, February 2018, listed \neight accounts all of which indicate a zero-past-due amount. (Ex. 6) As previously \ndiscussed, the auto loan was settled and paid. Applicant has read books on how to get \nout of debt, how to manage one\u2019s money, becoming debt free, and financial management. \n(Tr. 45) In March 2018, he attended the first session of a financial planning course. (Ex. \nM) In May 2018, he completed a financial planning course. (Ex. L) \n \nApplicant\u2019s $250 gas bill (SOR 1.g) was paid, and his most recent credit report \nlisted no amount as past due. (Ex. H) The $496 power bill (SOR 1.f) was paid, and there \nwas no amount past due. (Ex. J) The two utility bills were the last bills for services received \njust before he left the state and moved to his current state. (Tr. 43, 44) \n \nApplicant is current on his $1,800 monthly rent. He has a 2007 and two 2008 \nautomobiles, all of which were purchased used. (Tr. 50) His car payments were $600 \nmonthly. (Tr. 50) Following the hearing, he paid off two of his vehicles, thereby eliminating \nmonthly payments of $246 and $218. (Ex. 4, 6, L, AF) He is current on his utility bills, \ninsurance, and student loan payments. (Tr. 51) He has $3,200 in his 401(k) retirement \nplan. (Tr. 52) He contributes two percent of his wages to his retirement plan, which is \nmatched by two percent by his employer. (Tr. 53) He has approximately $3,000 in a \nsavings account and $1,800 in his checking account. (Tr. 58) Applicant is timely repaying \nhis former company\u2019s for tuition reimbursement. (Ex. R, U, V) \nOn Applicant\u2019s April 2015 e-QIP, he indicated he was currently working with his \nmortgage company to resolve a second mortgage debt incurred when he was unable to \nsell the home when his job relocated him to a new state in September 2011. (Ex. 1, Ex. \n2, Tr. 26) He had found a buyer for a short sale. The short sale was unsuccessful, and \nthe house went to foreclosure. (Tr. 54) Applicant\u2019s February 2018 credit report lists a zero \nbalance and zero past due on this debt. (Ex. 6) The debt was settled and paid. (Tr. 27, \n54) The mortgage debt was not listed as a debt of concern in the SOR.  \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 performance evaluation form indicated Applicant was always \npositive \nand \nencouraged \nother \nteam \nmembers. \nHis \noverall \nrating \nwas \n\u201cAchieved/Substantially Achieved.\u201d (Ex. F)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n6 \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \n\n \n7 \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed-upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, \n2014, and 2015, and he failed to timely file his 2015 state tax return. Additionally, he owed \napproximately $27,000 on his student loans and had three additional charged-off debts, \nwhich totaled $744. AG \u00b6 19 includes four disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern any may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b) \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d \n \nSecurity concerns having been raised, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. September 22, 2005)). Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of \nexplanation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n\n \n8 \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nIn 2011, Applicant made a job-related relocation from Texas to Florida and in \nFebruary 2015, Applicant made another job-related relocation from Florida to his current \nstate. In April 2013, he incurred medical expenses when his automobile was \u201ctotaled\u201d in \nan accident. His vehicle was rear ended by an ambulance that caved in the back end of \nhis vehicle. His automobile insurance paid only 75 percent of the value of his vehicle. \nThese are factors beyond his control. When one job ends and a new job is in a different \nstate, the loss of employment and costs of moving are factors beyond one\u2019s control. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) applies.  \n \nApplicant has read books on how to get out of debt, how to manage one\u2019s money, \nbecoming debt free, and financial management. He attended multiple sessions of a \nfinancial planning course, which he completed in May 2018. Applicant is current on his \nutility bills, insurance, and his $1,800 monthly rent. He has paid off two of his automobile \nloans reducing his $600 monthly car payments by more than $450. He has $3,200 in his \n401(k) retirement plan, contributes regularly to his retirement plan has approximately \n$3,000 in a savings account, and $1,800 in his checking account. He is current on his \nstudent loan obligation, paid the three charged-off accounts, filed his delinquent tax \nreturns, and received sizable tax refunds. His financial counseling course was provided \n\n \n9 \nby a legitimate and credible source. There are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has limited applicability. Applicant had three debts in addition to his \nstudent loan obligation, which indicates his delinquent obligations were few. His initial \nfailure to file his 2013 tax return was due to a lack of documents necessary to prepare his \nreturn. He now has a better way of collecting the data he needs to file his taxes. He is \nmore vigilant and disciplined in his data collection, and he puts everything on a \nspreadsheet including a budget, when bills are due, so that the data needed is available \nwhen he has to file his taxes. It is unlikely his non-timely filing of his tax returns will recur. \nHis current handling of his finances does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant had three charged-off debts totaling $744, which have been paid. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies to these three debts. The largest listed SOR debts were his two student \nloan obligations that totaled just over $27,000. He is current on his student loan obligation. \nHis April 2015 credit report lists the two student loan obligations as being \u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d \nHis August 2016 credit report lists the loans as being approximately $900 past due. His \nFebruary 2018 credit report lists zero past due on each account. He provided \ndocumentation of timely payments of his $207 student loan payments through January \n2019. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to his student loan obligation.  \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2013, 2014, and 2015 Federal income tax returns \nand his 2015 state income tax return in a timely manner. He requested various filing \nextensions, but the extensions did not extend until February 2017 and June 2017 when \nall the delinquent returns were filed. A willful failure to timely make (means completed and \nfiled with the IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal \noffense.5 The failure to timely file federal tax returns has security implications because: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \n                                                          \n5Title 26 U.S.C, \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads: \n  \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to \nmake a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . . make \nsuch return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required \nby law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor . . . .  \n \nA willful failure to make tax return, keep records, or supply information when required, is \na misdemeanor without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, \n317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States \nv. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. \n1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file \nhis federal income tax returns against him as a federal crime. \n \n\n \n10 \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nThe Appeal Board ruled that \u201ceven in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016). \n \nIn this instance AG \u00b6 20(g) applies because Applicant has filed all delinquent tax \nreturns and received tax refunds totaling more than $12,800. He used the refunds to pay \nhis wife\u2019s student loan obligation and to make payments on various other debts. He \ninitially failed to timely file his 2013 Federal return because he did not have the necessary \ndocuments related to his wife\u2019s business. His tax filings were further delayed when his \ntax documents were boxed up when he moved in February 2015. He was in the process \nof filing his returns when things became misplaced during the move.  \n \nThe timing of an applicant\u2019s efforts at debt resolution is relevant in evaluating the \nsufficiency of his case for mitigation. Applicant began his efforts to resolve his tax issues \nproblems before he was placed on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy. In November \n2016, prior to the issuance of the June 2017 SOR, Applicant contacted the IRS about his \nfailure to file his 2013, 2014, and 2015 returns. He was granted an extension until \nDecember 2016 and told if he was unable to meet the deadline, he should continue \nworking to get them filed as soon as possible.  \n \nApplicant believed he was prevented from filing his 2014 and 2015 returns until he \nhad completed and filed the 2013 return. This is an incorrect, but understandable, \nassumption. In general, each tax year is an independent entity. In actuality, nothing \nprevents a taxpayer from completing a tax return simply because the prior year\u2019s return \nhad not been filed because a taxpayer is permitted to estimate information for filing when \nactual information is not available. 6 However, Applicant\u2019s assumptions are reasonable. I \n                                                          \n6 When tax information is unavailable, the taxpayer is supposed to provide a good-faith estimate and \ndisclose the estimation to the IRS. See American Institute of Certified Public Accountants website, \n\u201cStandards for Tax Services No. 4, Use of Estimates,\u201d \nhttps://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/tax/resources/standardsethics/statementsonstandardsfortaxservices/\ndownloadabledocuments/ssts-no.4-use-of-estimates.pdf.  \n \n\n \n11 \nfind Applicant\u2019s failure to complete his 2013 return is a reasonable explanation for his \nfailure to file his 2014 and 2015 returns in a timely manner.  \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s track record of filing his delinquent tax returns and receiving \nrefunds, paying or resolving the three other listed debts, being current on his student loan \nobligation, and current on his rent, car payment, utility bills, and his saving and retirement \naccounts, there are clear indications that his past financial problems are resolved and his \nfinances are under control. He has shown good faith in addressing his debts. He has \nsufficient income to keep his financial obligations in current status and to continue paying \nhis $207 monthly student loan obligation. I am confident that Applicant will conscientiously \nendeavor to maintain his financial responsibility. His efforts are sufficient to mitigate \nfinancial considerations trustworthiness concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. Applicant is a 42-year-\nold senior software engineer who has been employed by a defense contractor since \nFebruary 2015. He honorably served in the U.S. Navy from July 1994 through June 1995. \n \nThe largest of the SOR debts of concern were two student loan obligations, which \nare current. Incurring a student loan is seen as an obligation incurred to improve an \nindividual\u2019s life, with respect to future employment and career prospects, and, as such, is \nviewed differently than a debt obligation incurred to purchase a new car or incurred for \n\n \n12 \ncredit card debt. He filed his delinquent tax returns and has established a \u201cmeaningful \ntrack record\u201d in the repayment of his student loan obligation. Other than his student loan \nobligation, the only delinquent obligations listed on the SOR totaled less than $750. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nDOD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. The issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been \npaid\u2014it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a \nsecurity clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He provided sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate \nhis history of financial problems, which are now largely resolved. Accordingly, this case \nis decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non September 6, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on May 25, 2017, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \n           \n             \n                                                          \n1 Exhibit 1. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 13, 2017. He admitted the four delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR and provided brief explanations for each debt. He also \nrequested an in-person hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on October 13, 2017. The hearing scheduled for \nJanuary 23, 2018, was postponed due to a government shutdown. The hearing took \nplace as rescheduled on April 18, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. \nDepartment Counsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-\n4. Applicant made an oral presentation and offered documentary exhibits, which were \nadmitted as Exhibits A-E. No witnesses were called other than Applicant.  \n  \nThe record was kept open until May 18, 2018, to allow Applicant an opportunity \nto submit additional matters. He made a timely submission on May 7, 2018, and those \nmatters, along with accompanying e-mails, are admitted without objections as Exhibit F.  \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \npreviously granted to him. He is employed as a weapons and communications operator \nfor a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since 2011, and his \nplace of work is a military proving ground. His formal education includes a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree awarded in 2013. He and his wife have three children, ages 10, 6, and 1. His \nemployment history includes honorable service on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps \nduring 2006-2010, which included a deployment to Iraq. His wife is a military veteran \ntoo.  \n \nThe SOR concerns four delinquent debts consisting of two charged-off accounts \nowed to the same credit union, a $1,330 collection account stemming from a credit card \naccount, and a $91 medical collection account for a total of about $14,059. He disclosed \nthe debts in his September 2016 security clearance application. He also disclosed a \npast-due mortgage loan that had been resolved by modification of the loan. He \nattributed his financial problems to the 2014 timeframe when he and his wife went from \nfour streams of income or paychecks to one. They had four streams of income based on \ntheir jobs and both received GI Bill benefits as they were attending school. The \nreduction in income occurred when he graduated and his wife lost her job and \npostponed attending school. They quickly found themselves over their heads with the \nsingle paycheck from Applicant\u2019s job. The status of the four delinquent debts is \ndiscussed below. \n \nCharged-off loans for $8,160 and $4,478 obtained from same credit union.2 The \ninitial loan was made to finance the purchase of the car, and then another personal loan \n                                                          \n2 Exhibits B \u2013 E.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nwas made, but it was secured by the car too. After defaulting on the loans, Applicant \nvoluntarily returned the vehicle, and the balances owed were charged off. The creditor \nunion then obtained a judgment in the amount of $13,436 plus $959 in attorney fees for \na total of $14,395 in November 2016. The judgment was paid and satisfied via a writ of \ngarnishment on both Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s paychecks, and the writ of garnishment \nwas released in February 2018. \n \nCollection account for $1,330. This debt stemmed from a credit card account that \nwas opened to finance the purchase of automobile tires. By the time the debt came to \nApplicant\u2019s attention, they were in their period of financial difficulty and unable to pay it. \nSince then, the balance on the account grew to more than $2,000, which Applicant \nresolved by agreeing to pay $1,450 in May 2018.3 \n \nMedical collection account for $91. Applicant was unaware of the debt until he \nsubmitted his 2016 security clearance application. He paid the debt in July 2017.4 \n \nIn addition to the four delinquent accounts in the SOR, an April 2018 credit report \nshows an unpaid medical collection account for $2,197. Applicant explained this debt \nstemmed from an injury he sustained while operating a Bradley Fighting Vehicle at \nwork.5 He understands the debt is covered by the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system \nand will be resolved in due course.6 \n \nApplicant earned a gross income of about $53,000 in 2017.7 His wife had \nrecently accepted a full-time teaching position to begin in fall 2018; previously she \nworked as a teacher\u2019s aide.8 He described their current financial situation as \u201cmuch \nmore stable,\u201d he has a $1,000 set aside for an emergency fund, and their joint checking \naccount had a balance of about $1,500.9 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \n                                                          \n3 Exhibit F.  \n \n4 Exhibit F.  \n \n5 Tr. 42-46.  \n \n6 Exhibit F.  \n \n7 Tr. 37.  \n \n8 Tr. 37-38. \n \n9 Tr. 51-52.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.10 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.11 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d12 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.13 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.14 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.15 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.16 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.17 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.18 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.19 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.20 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n10 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n11 Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .21 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The two \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nConcerning the evidence in extenuation and mitigation, Applicant receives credit \nunder both AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d). His financial problems stemmed from a reduction in \nhousehold income. In particular, his wife\u2019s job loss and her decision to postpone \nattending school (via the GI Bill benefits) were unexpected events that resulted in a \nreduction of household income. More to the point, Applicant took sufficient action to \nresolve the four delinquent accounts in the SOR. Perhaps he could have acted sooner, \n                                                          \n21 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nbut his ability (cash flow) to do so was no doubt limited by the demands of supporting \nhis spouse and three children. His financial situation is now improved, he has stable \nemployment, and his spouse is transitioning into a full-time job. Taken together, it \nappears he has done a good job at putting his financial house in order.   \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \n \nMichael H.

Ayotte, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 28, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 28, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 2, 2017. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nApril 25, 2018, scheduling the hearing for June 7, 2018.  \n01/09/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government\u2019s exhibit list, discovery \nletter, and administrative notice request, as well as Applicant\u2019s exhibit list and \nmemorandum were appended to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I, II, III, IV, and V, \nrespectively. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, called one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AE) A through F, which I admitted in evidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, \nI kept the record open until June 21, 2018. Applicant did not submit additional \ndocumentation by that date. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 15, \n2018.1 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. She is a 41-year-old, native-born \nU.S. citizen and resident. She obtained bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in 1999 and \n2003, respectively. She is married. She has three minor children; all are native-born \nU.S. citizens. She and her husband have owned their home in the United States since \nJuly 2004.2        \n \n  Applicant has worked for her current employer, a DOD contractor, since late \n2017. She worked for previous DOD contractors since 2004. She has held a security \nclearance since approximately 2008.3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband is 44 years old. He was born in Pakistan. He immigrated to \nthe United States on a student visa in 2001, at age 24. He and his family in Pakistan are \nreligious minorities, and he sought to escape the turmoil in Pakistan. He does not intend \nto return to Pakistan to live.4 \n \nApplicant met her husband online in 2003; she married him later that year. At the \ntime, he was in the United States in transition from a student to a work visa, and she \nwas working full time and pursuing her master\u2019s degree. He became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in 2009 and he holds a U.S. passport. His Pakistani passport expired in 2009, he \nhas not since renewed it, and he has no intentions of doing so in the future.5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law died in 2011. Her father-in-law, brother-in-law, and one \nsister-in-law are citizens and residents of Pakistan, and her second sister-in-law is a \nPakistani citizen residing in Canada. Both Applicant and her husband testified that none \nof the family in Pakistan is affiliated with the Pakistani government or military. \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 10-18, 64, 89-90. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 18-35, 48, 64-79; AE A. \n \n3 Tr. at 7-8, 65-79; GE 1, 2; AE B. \n \n4 Tr. at 20-89; GE 1, 2, 3. \n \n5 Tr. at 20-89; GE 1, 2, 3. \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is 75 years old. He lives in a rental property in an affluent \nneighborhood that is protected by a guard. He works for a private company.6  \n \nApplicant communicates with her father-in-law telephonically once every two to \nthree months. She described her husband\u2019s relationship with his father as a close one. \nHer husband talks to his father two to three times weekly. Applicant and her husband \nvisited and stayed with her father-in-law in Pakistan for three weeks in 2006. They did a \nfew tourist activities but primarily stayed close to her father-in-law\u2019s neighborhood. Her \nfather-in-law kept their passports in a locked safe and made sure they were with his \ndriver-bodyguard anytime they left his neighborhood. Applicant has not since returned \nto Pakistan and she does not intend to in the future, primarily because she received her \nsecurity clearance but also because her father-in-law advised against it given the \npolitical climate there.7  \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband and children have since traveled to Pakistan. They travel to \nPakistan every year to visit his father. They travel on their U.S. passports. As of the date \nof the hearing, Applicant\u2019s husband last traveled there in April 2017. He has no intention \nof visiting Pakistan once his father, sister, and sister\u2019s children no longer live there. For \ntwo weeks each in 2016 and 2017, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law visited and stayed with \nApplicant and her family in the United States. He was scheduled to revisit them in June \n2018. Through the sponsorship of Applicant\u2019s husband, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nobtained a green card in 2016. He intends to move to the United States and live with \nApplicant and her husband once her sister-in-law is approved to immigrate to Canada, \nas further discussed below.8 \n  \nApplicant\u2019s one sister-in-law is a Pakistani citizen residing in Pakistan.  She is 41 \nyears old. She is widowed, as her husband died in 2011, and she has two children. She \nis a teacher in a private elementary school. Applicant\u2019s husband sends his sister $200 \nmonthly, and he talks to her and her children two to three times weekly to biweekly. \nApplicant communicates with this sister-in-law telephonically twice yearly, primarily \nduring the holidays, in which they discuss their children or the health of Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law. Aside from meeting this sister-in-law\u2019s eldest child once, in 2006, \nApplicant does not have any contact with this sister-in-law\u2019s children. As of the hearing \ndate, this sister-in-law was in the process of trying to immigrate to Canada. Applicant \nexpected that this sister-in-law would be approved to immigrate to Canada by the end of \n2019.9  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is 37 years old. Applicant met her brother-in-law when \nshe visited Pakistan in 2006. Since then, their sole contact was electronically once or \ntwice between 2007 and 2008. Applicant testified that her husband\u2019s family fell out of \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 20-89; GE 1, 2, 3; AE F. \n \n7 Tr. at 20-89; GE 2, 3. \n \n8 Tr. at 20-89; GE 3. \n \n9 Tr. at 20-64, 71-89; GE 3. \n\n \n4 \n \ntouch with her brother-in-law. Applicant\u2019s husband testified that his father talks to his \nbrother once in a while. He also testified that he had not seen or heard from his brother \nsince around 2010, stating that \u201cwe have no connection.\u201d He testified that his brother is \nmarried to a Pakistani and they have one minor child. He also testified that he was \nunaware what his brother did for a living and whether he intended to remain in \nPakistan.10 \n \nApplicant\u2019s other sister-in-law is 38 years old. She is married and she has two \nminor children. This sister-in-law and her husband are Pakistani citizens residing in \nCanada. This sister-in-law immigrated to Canada in 2016, and she is in the process of \nbecoming a Canadian citizen. She works in office administration, and her husband is \nattempting to start his own business. Since Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law moved to Canada, \nthey talk to each other telephonically or electronically once every two to three months, \nprimarily about their children. Prior to that, when Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law resided in \nPakistan, they communicated minimally. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law visited Applicant and \nher family in the United States when she received her Canadian permanent residency \nand again in 2017. Applicant has never met or communicated with her sister-in-law\u2019s \nhusband.11 \n \nApplicant\u2019s assets in the United States, to include their home, total approximately \n$400,000, which does not include her children\u2019s savings accounts that are held by her \nparents. Applicant\u2019s husband received money from his father three times: (1) his father \npaid for the costs associated with his move to the United States; (2) his father gave him \nmoney when he immigrated to the United States; and (3) when his father sold the family \nhome in Pakistan in 2015, the proceeds of the sale were divided among Applicant\u2019s \nhusband and his three siblings, and Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s portion was $40,000. \nApplicant\u2019s husband put the $40,000 in a bank account in his name in Pakistan, and \ngave his father a power of attorney over the account in the event his father would need \nthe money. If Applicant\u2019s father-in-law does not need the money before he moves to the \nUnited States, Applicant\u2019s husband intends to transfer the money to the United States. \nAside from the money he sends to his sister-in-law in Pakistan, Applicant\u2019s husband \nalso sends $1,000 monthly to a charity in Pakistan that is run by his cousin, which \nsupports orphan children in schools. Neither Applicant nor her husband have any other \nforeign financial interests.12 \n \nApplicant testified that her husband is aware that she holds a security clearance, \nbut her foreign family members are not. She testified that neither he nor her foreign \nfamily members are aware about the specific nature of her work, as she does not \ndiscuss it with anyone. He is aware that her work is affiliated with the DOD. She testified \nthat she has always been compliant with annual security training requirements, and she \nreported her 2006 trip to Pakistan in accordance with such requirements. Both she and \nher husband testified that they would report to the proper authorities any attempts by \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 20-89; GE 3. \n \n11 Tr. at 20-64, 71-89; GE 3. \n \n12 Tr. at 20-89; GE 1, 2, 3. \n\n \n5 \n \nanyone to obtain information about her or the nature of her work. She indicated that she \nis loyal and bears a sense of allegiance and obligation only to the United States, and \nshe would resolve any conflict in favor of the United States.13 \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are native-born U.S. citizens. They are retired farmers, and \nher mother is also a retired registered nurse. Her father served in the U.S. military for \ntwo years. Applicant and her family are heavily involved in their community. Her children \nparticipate in Girl Scouts, and dance and swim lessons. A number of character \nreferences, to include members in her community, described her as honest and \ntrustworthy. Her direct supervisor noted that she is the consummate professional, and \nthat he had no reason to question her loyalty, integrity, or commitment to the United \nStates.14 \n \nPakistan  \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens against all non-essential travel to \nPakistan. Travel by U.S. Government personnel within Pakistan is restricted. Terrorist \ngroups continue to pose a danger to U.S. citizens throughout Pakistan, and evidence \nsuggests that some victims of terrorist activity were targeted because they are \nAmericans. Although al-Qaida in Pakistan has been degraded, its global leadership \ncontinued to operate from remote locations in the region that the group has historically \nexploited for safe haven. Pakistan did not take substantial action against the Afghan \nTaliban or Haqqani Network, or substantially limit their ability to threaten U.S. interests \nin Afghanistan. Pakistan has also not taken sufficient action against other externally-\nfocused groups such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad in 2016, which \ncontinued to operate, train, organize, and fundraise in Pakistan.  \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department\u2019s 2016 Human Rights Report for Pakistan indicates \nthat the most serious human rights problems in Pakistan were the following: (1) \nextrajudicial and targeted killings; (2) disappearances; (3) torture; (4) lack of rule of law; \n(5) gender inequality; and (6) sectarian violence. Other human rights problems included \narbitrary detention, governmental infringement on citizens\u2019 privacy rights, a weak \ncriminal justice system, and a lack of judicial independence. There were government \nrestrictions on freedom of assembly and limits on freedom of movement. Government \npractices and certain laws limited freedom of religion, particularly for religious minorities. \nCorruption within the government and police, as well as discrimination against women \nand girls remained serious problems. Societal discrimination against national, ethnic, \nand racial minorities persisted, as did discrimination based on caste, sexual orientation, \nand gender identity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n13 Tr. at 20-35, 67-89; GE 3; AE D. \n \n14 Tr. at 35, 65-68; AE C, E. \n\n \n6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, one sister-in-law, and brother-in-law are Pakistani \ncitizens residing in Pakistan. Applicant met her brother-in-law once in 2006 in Pakistan \nand she last communicated with him in 2008. Applicant\u2019s husband last communicated \nwith his brother in 2010, and he does not have a relationship with his brother. However, \nboth Applicant and her husband maintain close contact with Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nand sister-in-law in Pakistan, and Applicant\u2019s father-in-law maintains contact with \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law. As such, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, and 1.c.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 \n8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \n7(b), and 7(e).   \n \nWhile Applicant only visited her in-laws in Pakistan in 2006, her father-in-law has \nvisited her and her family in the United States as recently as 2016 and 2017. In \naddition, her husband and their children have visited her father-in-law and sister-in-law \nin Pakistan at least once yearly since 2006. Applicant and her husband also maintain \nregular contact with her father-in-law and sister-in-law. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established for \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. As discussed above, however, Applicant only met her brother-in-\nlaw once in 2006 and she last communicated with him in 2008. Applicant\u2019s husband last \ncommunicated with his brother in 2010, and he does not have a relationship with his \nbrother. As such, AG \u00b6 8(c) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n\n \n9 \n \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen. She has lived in the United States her \nentire life. She obtained her education in the United States. She has worked for \nvarious DOD contractors since 2004. Her assets in the United States total \napproximately $400,000. While her husband has $40,000 in a bank account in \nPakistan, and sends money to his sister as well as a charity owned by his cousin in \nPakistan, they do not have any other foreign financial interests or any expectation of \ninheriting any such interests. He plans on transferring the $40,000 to the United States \nonce his father moves to the United States, and his sister is in the process of moving \nto Canada. AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under this \nguidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Edmunds, Esquire \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n    Statement of the Case \nOn July 17, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudication \nFacility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E Personal Conduct).1 In \na September 6, 2017, response, Applicant answered the allegations and requested a \nhearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. \nI was assigned the case on June 12, 2018.  \nA June 20, 2018, notice was issued which set the hearing for August 22, 2018. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered five documents, \naccepted into the record without objection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-5. Applicant offered \ntestimony and 16 exhibits, accepted without objection as Exs. A-P. The record was held \nopen through August 31, 2018, in the event either party wished to submit additional \nmaterials. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on August 30, 2018. On \nAugust 31, 2018, Applicant offered what was marked as Ex. P. With no objection \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n03/29/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nforthcoming, the item was accepted on September 1, 2018, and the record was closed. \nBased on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed to \nmitigate sexual behavior and personal conduct security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old reliability engineer who has worked for the same entity \nfor nearly six years. He has earned a bachelor of science degree, three master\u2019s \ndegrees, and a doctorate degree. In the interim, he accepted a commission in the U.S. \nArmy, where he began with his Army Reserves unit in 1987. He was transferred to the \nretired Army Reserves as a lieutenant colonel after 26 years. Most recently, he \ncompleted seminary school and became a chaplain at the rank of major.  \n \n \nIn 2007, Defense Criminal Investigative Services (DCIS) and Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) conducted a national investigation that identified over \n5,000 U.S. individuals, some with DOD affiliations, who subscribed to known child \npornography websites. In 2007, Applicant returned from a deployment with a compact \ndisc (CD) of some military orders and sermons. (Tr. 24, 37) He did not realize the orders \nwere sensitive or otherwise protected. (Tr. 41) Applicant also returned suffering from \nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s home was searched as part of the DCIS and CID national \ninvestigation. He admitted viewing adult content of a titillating nature on the Internet. \nApparently, no images of underage individuals, however, were found and archived that \nwere noted as pornographic. (Tr. 34-36) The past military orders, however, were found. \nApplicant claimed that someone had given him permission to have the orders, but he \nwas unable to provide a name or documentation reflecting permission was given. A \nwritten warning for mishandling classified information was issued.   \n \nWhen Applicant came back from his next deployment in 2011, his estranged wife \ntold him that two deployments was too much for their marriage, and that she wanted a \ndivorce. (Tr. 22) Their five year marriage would end in divorce in 2013. (Tr. 17-18) After \nshe moved away, he had difficulty sleeping. As a result, he would spend the nights on \nthe computer viewing pornography. (Tr. 19) \n \nIn late 2010, DCIS and CID determined that its previous investigational checks \nhad left several leads insufficiently examined or deficiently investigated. (Ex. 3 at 2) In \nJune 2011, Applicant was again investigated by DCIS/CID for possession of child \npornography. This entailed reopening the 2007 investigation, during which time the lab, \nwhich had lost its evidence from 2007, inspected new material. (Tr. 36). Also, a mix-up \nof some sort led to a hard drive that did not belong to Applicant being made part of the \ninvestigation.  \n \nDuring the interview, Applicant was asked if he had any unauthorized charges to \nhis credit card. He answered a charge had been made for a hotel. When specifically \nasked about a particular website he had visited, he chose to end the interview and \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nconsult an attorney. (EX. 3 at 2) His clearance and access were suspended in August \n2012. (Ex. 2) Later, four to six images were discovered on Applicant\u2019s media, two \nimages were identified as containing known child victims identified by the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).2 (Ex. 3 at 3) \n \nIn 2012, Applicant returned from another deployment. At the conclusion of the \ninvestigation, the Assistant U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined to prosecute due to \nevidentiary deficiencies and statute of limits issues. (Ex. 3) Local prosecutors similarly \ndeclined to prosecute the matter.3 However, a Memorandum of Reprimand (MOR) was \nissued to Applicant on January 26, 2013. He was given 15 days from receipt of the \nMOR to respond in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation. (Ex. 2) A general officer\u2019s letter \nof reprimand dated January 26, 2013, was issued, determining that child pornography \nand unsecured classified material was found at Applicant\u2019s home. (Ex. 2) This fact was \nfound to be particularly \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d because Applicant is an Army \nchaplain. (Ex. 3 at 4) The reprimand became final in April 2013. Applicant was \ntransferred to retired reserve status on May 1, 2013, with the recommendation his \nsecurity clearance be revoked. (Ex. 2)  \n \nApplicant disagrees with the assessment of the military that the images at issue \nwere child pornography. Applicant has viewed the photos, noting that some were nude, \nwhile others included scanty clothing. He testified that he had never seen the photos \nbefore. Throughout the hearing, Applicant stressed the models were not engaged in \nsexual activity and, therefore, could not be deemed child pornography, per se. Applicant \nrepeatedly acknowledged that his reputation would be harmed if the issues regarding \nsexual behavior became public knowledge.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to the AG, \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept,\u201d each of which must be fully considered in making a decision. \n                                                          \n2 In December 2012, four of the children were determined to be underage by professionals according to \nbody habitus and other criteria. (Ex. 3 at 4)  \n \n3 It is noted that the lack of criminal charges does not preclude a finding that an applicant engaged in the \nconduct underlying the cited offenses nor does it indicate such offenses are entitled to little weight. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 12-11795. \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Any doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility and will be \nresolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only \nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the record evidence. \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted \nfacts alleged in the SOR. Under the Directive, an applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. Decisions include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nDecisions are in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination \nas to the loyalty of the applicant.   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior  \n \nAG \u00b6 12 sets forth the security concern as follows:  \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual.  \n \nApplicant began viewing Internet-derived pornography for entertainment at some \npoint in his life prior to 2007. He was identified by DSIC and CID as an individual whose \ncredit card had been linked to known child pornography websites. His premises and \nmedia were inspected in 2007, but the inspection was deemed inadequate in 2010. In \n2011, he was again subject to investigation. He quit complying with investigators when \nasked about a specific website known to offer child pornography. What was deemed to \nbe child pornography was found, but the Assistant U.S. Attorney and local authorities \ndeclined to prosecute due to issues involving the material and the statue of limitations.  \n \nThe military, however, found the investigative findings and Applicant\u2019s conduct to \nbe particularly \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d because Applicant is an Army chaplain. \nA formal reprimand was issued and became final in April 2013. As a result, Applicant \nwas transferred to retired reserve status on May 1, 2013, with the recommendation his \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nsecurity clearance be revoked. His sexual behavior has thus became a concern \nbecause he is now susceptible to coercion, exploitation, or duress and it could \nadversely affect his reputation, esteem in the community, judgment, and his ability to \nfind or keep a job.   \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides conditions that could raise a disqualifying condition:  \n \nAG \u00b6 13 (a):  sexual behavior of a criminal nature . . . ; \n \nAG \u00b6 13 (b): pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; \n \nAG \u00b6 13 (c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 13 (d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment.  \n \nUnder these circumstances, AG \u00b6 13 (a) and AG \u00b6 13 (c) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 14 provides the following possible mitigating conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (a): the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and \nthere is no evidence of subsequent conduct of similar nature;  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, \nor under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and \ndiscreet; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate \nprogram of treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has \nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional \nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment.  \n \nThe behavior at issue occurred in Applicant\u2019s middle years. Applicant\u2019s continued \nprotestation that the material at issue was not child pornography, despite the fact this is \nnot the forum to appeal previous findings by DCIS and the military, makes it difficult to \njudge whether such behavior could recur. The established facts of record in the \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits do tend, however, to bring into question Applicant\u2019s judgment \nand current reliability. Two of the children were identified as having been previously \nidentified as missing or exploited children, obviating application of AG \u00b6 14 (d). \nApplicant is not currently in treatment or a recent graduate of an appropriate program. \nTherefore, I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \n \nHere, Applicant was the subject of the aforementioned investigation regarding \nchild pornography in 2007 and in 2010. While federal and local prosecutors declined to \nprosecute, the military issued a formal reprimand seriously condemning the behavior \nexhibited, and the disgrace wrought by one of its own chaplains under these \ncircumstances. Applicant admits public knowledge of the facts involved would harm his \nreputation. Also, Applicant was found with sensitive or protected information on his \npersonal media during the 2007 investigation. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(e) applies.    \n \nI have considered these facts in light of the AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions. I find \nthe following potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nHere, the offenses at issue are particularly worrisome, as issues both reflecting \npoor judgment and a lack of trustworthiness. Applicant attempted to absolve himself of \nresponsibility for the sensitive or protected material by stating he was told he could \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \npossess the material, but he failed to provide a name or documentary evidence \nsupporting this claim. On one hand, Applicant continues to deny having downloaded \nchild pornography, on the other hand, he failed to show how the Government\u2019s \ndocumentary evidence is incorrect. Further, in neither situation of misconduct has he \nraised any mitigating facts that would tend to show some form of similar conduct, be it \nintentional or accidental, will not occur in the future. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nMoreover, by fearfully keeping the matter private, he failed to give rise to AG \u00b6 17(e). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

I conclude she has mitigated the \nsecurity concern. Clearance is granted.   \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 21, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive) and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June \n8, 2018. \n \nOn July 13, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting subparagraphs 1.a \nthrough 1.d, and denying the remainder. She requested a hearing, whereupon the case \n \n\n2 \n \nwas assigned to me on July 20, 2018. On September 13, 2018, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for October \n10, 2018. The hearing was held as scheduled. I received five Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 \nGE 5) and twelve Applicant exhibits (AE A - AE L). I marked another exhibit as AE M for \nidentification purposes, but did not incorporate it into the record. I also incorporated a copy \nof the discovery letter that Department Counsel mailed to Applicant (Hearing Exhibit I). At \nthe close of the hearing, I left the record open to November 10, 2018 for Applicant to \nsubmit additional documents. Within the time allotted, she submitted three additional \nexhibits that I received as AE N through AE P.  On January 9, 2019, Applicant moved for \nthe admission of two additional exhibits (AE Q and AE R). Department Counsel did not \nobject to their admission, therefore I re-opened the record and admitted the documents. \nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on October 19, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old single woman with four children. The oldest child is a \nteenager, the middle children are five-year-old twins, and the youngest is three months old. \nApplicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in health science in 2016. (Tr. 19) From August \n2015 to December 2017 she worked as a medical administrative assistant. Her duties \nincluded helping service members transfer from active duty to civilian life. (GE 1 at 12) She \nleft the job after her clearance was denied (Tr. 74), and was unemployed until September \n2018, when she gained a part-time job as a paralegal. (Tr. 14) According to Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor when she worked as a medical administrative assistant, she was an impressive \nemployee who provided great care to the service members. (AE O) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges approximately $35,000 of delinquent debt. The debts alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c are delinquent car loans. Subparagraph 1.a, totaling \n$14,233, is a loan used to finance the purchase of a car in 2011. (GE 5 at 9) She kept up \nwith payments for eight months until she stopped receiving child-support payments from \nher oldest child\u2019s father in December 2011. (GE 3 at 1)  The car was repossessed in 2012. \n(Tr. 68) \n \n \nIn September 2012, Applicant purchased another car, financing it with a loan \nsecured by the creditor alleged in subparagraph 1.c. (Tr. 35; GE 3 at 2) Three months later, \nshe discovered that she was pregnant with her twins. By May 2013, recurring difficulties \nrelated to the pregnancy required her to go on bedrest. (Tr. 36) Unable to work, she fell \nbehind on her car note. (GE 5 at 9; Tr. 33)   \n \n \nWith the help of her mother, who cosigned the loan, Applicant purchased an \nautomobile in 2015. When she applied for the loan, the loan officer told her the \ndelinquency on the loan, alleged in subparagraph 1.c, was too high to roll into the new car \nloan. Consequently, he advised her to allow the car secured by the loan alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.c to be repossessed. (Tr. 32) Kicking the deficiency down the road would \nenable her to secure a loan for the purchase of the new car. Applicant then lost her job. \nSubsequently, she defaulted on the loan, and the car was repossessed, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.b. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 32) \n\n3 \n \n \n \nIn sum, all three cars that Applicant purchased between 2011 and 2015 were \nrepossessed. In November 2017, Applicant wrote each creditor a letter with a proposed \npayment plan. (AE G \u2013 H) Under each respective plan, she proposed to satisfy the \ndelinquencies with $100 monthly payments. (AE G \u2013 H) Shortly after writing the automobile \ncreditors, Applicant lost her job, and just regained part-time employment one month before \nthe hearing in September 2018. (Tr. 42, 74)  She has been unable to execute any of the \nproposed payment plans.  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.d is a loan for which Applicant applied during \nthe period when she was not working and on bedrest in 2013. (Tr. 42) When Applicant lost \nher job, the account became delinquent in the approximate amount of $1,106. (Tr. 42-43) \nApplicant contacted the creditor and agreed to a payment plan. Per the agreement, she \nwas to pay $140 per month. (Tr. 42) In December 2017, she lost her job, rendering her \nunable to make the payments. (Tr.  42) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e is a delinquent utility bill in the amount of $228. This delinquency \ncoincided with the period of time when she was not working and on bedrest. (Tr. 21) In \nNovember 2017, Applicant contacted the creditor to arrange payment. (Tr. 44) Per the \nagreement, the creditor was supposed to automatically debit her account. They never did, \nand Applicant never called them again. (Tr.  45)  \n \n \n \nThe creditor alleged in subparagraph 1.f is an insurance company that insured one \nof the repossessed cars. (Tr. 45) The alleged delinquency is $136. Applicant disputed this \ndebt, contending that, per the auto insurance agreement, she always paid the insurance \npayment in advance of the month she received the insurance coverage. (Tr. 45) She \nsuccessfully disputed the debt and it was removed from her credit report. (45-46) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g is a delinquent repair bill owed to a rental-car company for \ndamages incurred in 2010 when Applicant was in a car accident with a rental car. (Tr. 47) \nThe delinquency totals $2,311. She disputes the bill, contending that she opted for car \ninsurance, but the rental company did not include it in the contract. (Tr. 47) She provided \nno evidence in support of her dispute. \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h, is a credit-card debt totaling $483. It has been delinquent since \nApril 2010. (GE 2 at 5) Applicant satisfied it through $50 monthly payments from \nSeptember 2015 to June 2016. (GE E at 7) She has reported payment of this debt to the \ncredit reporting agency and is seeking to have it removed from her credit report. (GE E at \n7) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.i stems from eviction-related costs from an \napartment where Applicant lived from June 2012 to May 2013. (Tr. 51) The alleged \ndelinquency totals $3,819. Applicant denies this account, but provided no evidence in \nsupport of her contention that she does not owe it. \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j is an alleged delinquent hospital bill totaling $3,132. Applicant \ndisputed this bill, contending that she received the treatment, but her medical insurance \ncovered it. (Tr. 54) She contacted her insurance company, who resubmitted the insurance \ninformation at her request. (Tr. 54) She then contacted the credit agency and had this bill \nremoved from her record. (AE F) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.k is a disputed medical bill totaling $319.  \nApplicant contacted the credit-reporting agency and had the debt deleted from her record. \n(AE F) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.l is a disputed parking ticket totaling $240. \nApplicant contacted the credit agency and had it removed from her credit report. (AE F) \n \n \nSince Applicant answered the SOR and began reaching out to creditors, her \nfinancial situation has worsened. Specifically, after she discovered she was pregnant with \nher fourth child, her boyfriend demanded that she terminate the pregnancy. (Tr. 74) When \nshe refused, he kicked her out of his home. (Tr. 74-75) Although the three oldest children \nstayed with him, Applicant was left without a steady home address during the period that \ncoincided with her unemployment. While unemployed, she was unable to follow through on \nthe delinquent car note payment plans, and incurred approximately $1,700 of additional \ndelinquent debts. (Tr. 70)  \n \n \nApplicant gained a part-time job in September 2018.  It pays $1,770 per month. (Tr. \n14) She remains without a fixed home address. Realizing that she would not be able to \nsatisfy her delinquencies under these circumstances, she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection in October 2018. By January 8, 2019, the bankruptcy court had administered her \nestate and closed the proceeding. (AE Q) The record does not contain the schedule of the \ndischarged debts. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n\n5 \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \n                                                 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n6 \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems and their ongoing nature trigger the \napplication of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nEmployment instability and erratic child-support payments have significantly \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s financial problems. In addition, on one occasion, she followed the \nadvice of an unscrupulous car dealer who proposed that she strategically default on a \nprevious auto loan to obtain a new car.  \n \n \nApplicant has satisfied one of her delinquencies in its entirety (subparagraph 1.h). \nShe has successfully disputed the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.f, and 1.k through 1.l. \nAfter experiencing her most recent job loss, which coincided with an unexpected pregnancy \nand homelessness, Applicant realized that she would be unable to satisfy the delinquent \ndebts, and decided, instead to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. It is unclear from \nthe record whether all of the debts were discharged in the bankruptcy. Moreover, AG \u00b6 \n20(e) is only partially applicable because Applicant did not provide concrete evidence of \nactions to resolve the debts alleged in subparagraph 1.g and 1.i. Nevertheless, the \ncircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control, the initial steps taken to resolve them before her \n\n7 \n \nmost recent unexpected personal setback, and the effort to obtain Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection are sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d).  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nApplicant did not incur her delinquent debts as the result of foolish or irresponsible \noverspending. Instead, they resulted from a number of personal crises. Currently, Applicant \nis underemployed, with a baby, and no stable living arrangement. Given these \ncircumstances, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection is a reasonable solution to her \nfinancial problems. Upon considering this case in the context of the whole-person concept, \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

When he was about 13 years old, while babysitting for a friend of the family, he \ntouched, and on a second occasion, he penetrated, a three-year-old girl\u2019s vagina with \nhis finger while getting aroused. He was never caught, but stopped his behavior \nbecause he knew that what he was doing was wrong. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \n2. Applicant started having uncomfortable feelings about his daughter - a strange \nsexual attraction - when she started puberty. He was afraid that he would do something \nstupid. When his daughter and her friends were about 13 years old (in about 2009), \nApplicant began sexually fantasizing about his daughter and her friends and \nmasturbated two to three times per month to those fantasies. Applicant denied he ever \ntouched his daughter or her friends inappropriately or that he acted on his fantasies \n(other than masturbating). (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant told the Agency investigator that he stopped his sexual fantasies in \nabout May 2011. (GE 3) At his hearing, Applicant testified that he stopped having the \nsexual fantasies after his interview with the last investigator in January 2015. (Tr. 39) \n \nAfter his 2010-2011 interviews, the Agency reported Applicant\u2019s statements to \nthe state\u2019s social services agency who investigated the concern. Applicant\u2019s family was \ninterviewed, and apparently he was cleared of sexual misconduct. \n \n3. In about 1988, Applicant removed documents from a sensitive compartmented \ninformation facility (SCIF) and took them to his home to study for an exam. Sometime \nlater, he returned the documents to the SCIF. He also took submarine qualifications \ncards (marked confidential) as souvenirs. Applicant averred that at the time he took the \ncards, he did not know they were marked confidential. During a move in 1999, he \ndiscovered they were marked confidential. Applicant did not return or properly dispose \nof the cards after he discovered they were classified confidential. He maintained \npossession of the cards until 2010 when an Agency investigator asked him to surrender \nthem to him. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b) \n \n4. In about 2009-2010, Applicant took computer equipment home without \nauthorization from his federal contractor employer. The equipment included, in part, a \nserver with five drives, eight to ten keyboards, mice, a wireless router, network cables, \nthree laptops, three docking stations, and cables for hard drives. Applicant explained \nthat he was asked to recycle old computer equipment under his control before the \ncompany moved to another location. Part of his job was to create mock computer labs \nfor testing and studies. He did not recycle the equipment and took it home because he \nbelieved he would need it to establish mock computer labs. Applicant did not asked for \nauthorization to take the equipment home. After he participated in four Agency \ninterviews, Applicant returned the equipment to his then employer to recycle it. \nApplicant donated some of the computer equipment he wrongfully appropriated to his \ndaughter\u2019s school robotics lab. \n \n5. SOR \u00b6 3.f alleges that Applicant deliberately omitted and failed to disclose \nmaterial information to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background \ninvestigator. Applicant participated in an interview with an OPM investigator in January \n2015. During the interview, he was asked whether he had sexual fantasies or \nmasturbation habits related to minors. Applicant admitted to having fantasies and that \nhe masturbated to pornography of young women, but specifically denied any sexual \nfantasies or masturbating habits related to minors. Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose to the OPM investigator all the information he disclosed during his four \ninterviews with the Agency investigators about his sexual fantasies and masturbation \nhabits concerning his minor daughter and her friends as set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n6. SOR \u00b6 3 g alleged that Applicant deliberately omitted and failed to disclose \nmaterial information to an OPM background investigator when he failed to disclose the \ntrue extent of his unauthorized taking of computer equipment from his employer as set \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nforth in SOR \u00b6 3.e. During his 2015 interview, Applicant admitted to, on one occasion, \ntaking home a computer shell (stripped of parts) except for its power supply. Applicant \ndeliberately omitted and failed to disclose that he had taken home, at least, a server \nwith five drives, eight to ten keyboards, mice, a wireless router, network cables, three \nlaptops, three docking stations, and cables for hard drives. \n \nWhen questioned about his omissions and failure to disclose the same \ninformation he disclosed to Agency investigators in 2010-2011, Applicant stated he did \nnot see the need to disclose the information because he assumed the investigator had \nread his statements to Agency investigators in 2010-2011. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 sets forth the security concern as follows: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \n \n \nAt age 13, Applicant sexually molested a three-year-old girl by twice fondling her \nvagina while getting aroused. When Applicant\u2019s daughter and friends were about 13 \nyears old (in about 2009), Applicant began sexually fantasizing about his daughter and \nher friends and masturbated frequently to those fantasies. He admitted to having a \n\u201cstrange sexual attraction\u201d to his then minor daughter. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual fantasies (thoughts) are not \u201cbehavior\u201d that could raise a \nconcern under the AGs, and there is no evidence he acted on his fantasies, except for \nhis masturbating habit. His masturbation occurred in the privacy of his home, and it \nremained private until he disclosed his masturbating habit to Agency investigators \nduring his 2010-2011 interviews. His sexual behavior then became a concern because \nhe is now susceptible to coercion, exploitation, or duress. Applicant would like to \nprevent others from knowing about his masturbating habits and sexual fantasies \ninvolving his minor daughter and her friends because it would adversely affect his \nreputation, esteem in the community, judgment, and his ability to find or keep a job.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature . . . ; \n \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s frequent masturbating habit to sexual fantasies about his underage \ndaughter and her friends raises concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(b) and (c). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 provides the following possible mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(a) and (b) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant was 13 years old at the time \nhe sexually molested the three year old girl, and there is no evidence of similar behavior \nduring the following 45 years.  \n \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s sexual fantasizing and masturbating to thoughts of his \ndaughter and her friends, there is no evidence to show Applicant ever acted on his \nfantasies (other than masturbating) or that he inappropriately touched a minor. His \nsexual behavior (masturbating) was strictly private. Applicant claimed that as a result of \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nthe state\u2019s social services investigation in 2011, his wife became aware of his sexual \nbehavior towards his minor daughter and her friends. If true, the basis for possible \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress would be diminished. However, Applicant failed to \npresent independent evidence to corroborate his testimony about his wife\u2019s knowledge \nand her forgiveness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(c) and (d) apply, in part, to SOR \u00b6 1.a, but they do not \ncompletely mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has not participated in any \ncounseling or treatment. AG \u00b6 14(e) does not apply. \n \nApplicant testified that he stopped sexually fantasizing and masturbating about \nhis daughter and her friends in 2015. Thus, I consider his questionable behavior recent. \nI note that Applicant told the Agency investigator that he stopped his sexual fantasies in \nabout May 2011. (GE 3) However, at his hearing, Applicant testified that he stopped \nhaving the sexual fantasies after his last interview with a Government investigator in \nJanuary 2015. (Tr. 39) \n \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information \u2013 which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information - raises \ndoubt about an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or \nwillingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern.1 \n \nSecurity clearance cases require administrative judges to assess whether an \napplicant has the requisite good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to be \nentrusted with classified information. When evidence is presented that an applicant \npreviously mishandled classified information or violated a rule or regulation for the \nprotection of protected information such an applicant bears a very heavy burden in \ndemonstrating that they should once again be found eligible for a security clearance.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s removal of documents classified confidential from a SCIF in 1988, \nand his taking and keeping the submarine qualification cards after he realized they were \nclassified confidential in 1999, raise the following Guideline K security concerns.  \n \nAG \u00b6 34(b): collecting and storing protected information in any \nunauthorized location; and \n \n                                            \n1 AG \u00b6 33. \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 11-12202 at 5 (App. Bd. June 23, 2014) (very heavy burden standard); ISCR \nCase No. 01-25941 at 5 (App. Bd. May 7, 2004) (security clearance determinations are \u201cnot an exact \nscience, but rather predicative judgments.\u201d). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34(g): any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified \nor other sensitive information. \n \nAfter considering the conditions that could mitigate the security concerns one is \npartially applicable to the facts in this case: \n \nAG \u00b6 35(a): so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it happened \nso infrequently or under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nApplicant returned to the SCIF the document he removed from it to study in \n1988. He found out that the submarine qualification cards he took as souvenirs were \nclassified confidential during one of his moves in 1999. However, he kept the submarine \nqualifications cards even after realizing they were classified confidential. Applicant was \ncommissioned in 1988, served in the Navy as an officer, and held a clearance until he \nretired in 2002. He was aware of the security rules that required him to protect classified \ninformation, to return the classified documents or destroy them, and to then notify his \nsecurity officer of his violation of the security rules. He failed to do so and retained the \nsubmarine qualifications cards until he was asked to hand them over to an Agency \ninvestigator in 2011. There is no evidence of additional security violations after 2011. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security infractions were deliberate, or the result of a reckless or even \nnegligent disregard for security rules and regulations. There is no evidence to show that \nafter his security violations ended (2011), Applicant established a strong reputation for \nfollowing and complying with security rules and regulations. Nor is there evidence of \nadditional training to prevent such security violations in the future.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information . . . .  \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleges in \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.d, the same \nfactual concerns alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and 2.a and 2.b. Because those concerns \nwere fully addressed under Guidelines D and K, for the sake of brevity my findings, \nanalysis, and conclusions under those guidelines will be incorporated herein without \nrepeating them. \n \n \nAdditionally, the SOR alleged that Applicant was less than candid and \nforthcoming during an official interview with an OPM investigator in 2015, when he failed \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nto disclose the full extent of his sexual fantasies and masturbation habits involving his \nminor daughter and her friends as disclosed to Agency investigators during interviews in \n2010-2011. (SOR \u00b6 3.f) During his 2015 interview, Applicant stated that he masturbated \nto pornography involving young women, but denied sexually fantasizing and \nmasturbating about minors. When cross-examined at hearing about the substantial \ndiscrepancy in his statements in 2010-2011 to those made in 2015, Applicant explained \nthat he believed the OPM investigator had access to and had read his statements to the \nAgency, and as such, he did not have to repeat the information.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that in 2009-2010, he wrongfully appropriated computer \nequipment from his federal employer and did not return the equipment until confronted \nabout it during at least four interviews with Agency investigators in 2010-2011. The \ncomputer equipment taken included, at least: a server with five drives, eight to ten \nkeyboards, mice, a wireless router, network cables, three laptops, three docking \nstations, and cables for hard drives. (SOR \u00b6 3.e) \n \n \nApplicant was less than candid and forthcoming during an official interview with \nan OPM investigator in 2015, when he failed to disclose the full extent of the numerous \ncomputer parts that he wrongfully appropriated from his employer. During his 2015 \ninterview, he admitted to taking home only one computer shell with a power supply and \nsome cables. He claimed that he had stripped out the hard drive and other components \nfrom the computer shell. He stated that he donated the computer shell to his daughter\u2019s \nhigh school. When cross-examined at hearing about the substantial discrepancy in his \nstatements, Applicant explained that he believed the OPM investigator had read his \nprior statements to the Agency, and as such, he did not have to repeat the information. \n(SOR \u00b6 3.g) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raises the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing \nor omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . .  \n \n \nThe record established the above disqualifying conditions, requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of the mitigating conditions. I considered the \nfollowing mitigating conditions set forth by AG \u00b6 17 as partially raised by the evidence: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant was 13 years old when he sexually molested the 3-year-old girl. (SOR \n\u00b6 3.a) There is no evidence to show Applicant has been involved in any similar behavior \nduring the last 45 years. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies and mitigates this allegation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual fantasies (thoughts) are not \u201cbehavior\u201d that could raise a \nconcern under the AGs, and there is no evidence he acted on his fantasies, except for \nhis masturbation habit. His masturbation practices occurred in the privacy of his home, \nand it remained private until he disclose his masturbation habit to Agency investigators \nduring his 2010-2011 interviews. His sexual behavior is a concern because he is \nsusceptible to coercion, exploitation, or duress. Applicant would like to prevent others \nfrom knowing about his masturbation habits and sexual fantasies involving his minor \ndaughter and her friends because it would adversely affect his reputation, esteem in the \ncommunity, put into question his judgment, and his ability to find or keep a job. Thus the \nreason he deliberately omitted the information during his 2015 interview.  \n \n \nApplicant has not participated in counseling. AG \u00b6 17(d) is not applicable. AG \u00b6 \n17(e) is partially applicable because Applicant and his family were interviewed by state \nsocial services and apparently he was cleared of the allegations. He testified that his \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nwife forgave him for his past sexual behavior; however, he failed to present \ncorroborating evidence to support his claim. Notwithstanding, its partial applicability, AG \n\u00b6 17(e) does not fully mitigate the concerns. Considering the evidence as a whole, I find \nthat the Guideline E allegations continue to raise concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), (c), and \n(e), which are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D, K, \nand E in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under that \nguideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant, 58, served in the Navy and was honorably retired after 20 years of \nservice. He has been employed with federal contractors since he retired in 2002. He \nheld a clearance while in the service that has been continued while working for federal \ncontractors to present.  \n \nNevertheless, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a \nsecurity clearance. Unmitigated security concerns lead me to conclude that granting a \nsecurity clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline K:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.e:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.f:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.g:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He has two sons, the oldest of which has graduated from college, and the youngest son is in college. He has two daughters, the oldest of which is in college, and the youngest is a sophomore in high school. But for a period of unemployment from April 2014 to January 2015, Applicant has been employed by defense contractors for 33 years.2 The SOR alleges that Applicant: (1) filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2015 which is in progress and he is delinquent on trustee payments; (2) filed a Chapter 13 bankrukptcy in November 2012, which was converted to a Chapter 7 in November 2014, and which was discharged in February 2015; (3) is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $14,830 (tax year 2013), which is included in the current bankruptcy case; (4) is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $6,805 (tax year 2015); (5) is indebted to his state of residence for $5,000, which is included in the current bankruptcy case.3 Applicant answered the SOR as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant admitted that he filed a Chapter 13 in March 2015. He did so to fend off his home mortgage company from foreclosing on his home after his November 2012 Chapter 13 was converted to a Chapter 7 and discharged in February 2015.

Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 16, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that his \ncircumstances raised security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 15, 2017, and requested a hearing to establish his \neligibility for continued access to classified information.1 \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here.    \n12/20/2018\n\n2 \n \n \nOn July 19, 2018, a date mutually agreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. \nApplicant testified, and the exhibits offered by the Government were admitted into the \nadministrative record without objection. (Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 3.) Applicant \noffered no exhibits, but his Answer to the SOR attached three documents, which I have \nmarked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was \nreceived on July 27, 2018. At the request of Applicant, without objection, the record \nremained open until July 31, 2018. Applicant timely submitted two documents, which I \nmarked as AE D and E and which were admitted without objection.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 59 years old, a college graduate, and married (since 1988) with four \nchildren. He has two sons, the oldest of which has graduated from college, and the \nyoungest son is in college. He has two daughters, the oldest of which is in college, and \nthe youngest is a sophomore in high school. But for a period of unemployment from April \n2014 to January 2015, Applicant has been employed by defense contractors for 33 \nyears.2 \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant: (1) filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2015 \nwhich is in progress and he is delinquent on trustee payments; (2) filed a Chapter 13 \nbankrukptcy in November 2012, which was converted to a Chapter 7 in November 2014, \nand which was discharged in February 2015; (3) is indebted to the IRS in the amount of \n$14,830 (tax year 2013), which is included in the current bankruptcy case; (4) is indebted \nto the IRS in the amount of $6,805 (tax year 2015); (5) is indebted to his state of residence \nfor $5,000, which is included in the current bankruptcy case.3  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR as follows:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant admitted that he filed a Chapter 13 in March 2015. He did so \nto fend off his home mortgage company from foreclosing on his home after his November \n2012 Chapter 13 was converted to a Chapter 7 and discharged in February 2015. \nApplicant denied that he is delinquent on his plan payments and said he is current. In fact, \nApplicant said he is about $4,000 ahead of schedule, because he pays every two weeks, \ninstead of monthly.4  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Applicant admitted that he filed a Chapter 13 in November 2012. He \ndid so because his wife had been laid off from her job, they fell behind in their mortgage \npayments, and the mortgage company repeatedly denied requests to modify the \nmortgage payments. Applicant filed for Chapter 13 because the mortgage company \nstarted foreclosure proceedings.5 \n                                                          \n2 Tr. 12-13; GE 1.  \n \n3 SOR \u00b6 1. \n \n4 Answer \u00b6 1.a. \n \n5 Answer \u00b6 1.b. \n\n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant admitted the 2013 IRS deficiency but offered two \nexplanations. First, his wife was working for a nonprofit organization, was paid as a 1099 \nemployee, and Applicant underwithheld. Second, Applicant\u2019s wife was awarded a bonus \nthat put them into a different tax bracket, and they had underwithheld. The IRS is receiving \npayments on this debt under the current Chapter 13 payment schedule.6 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Applicant admitted the 2015 IRS deficiency but explained that he has \nadded this debt to the current Chapter 13 payment schedule.7 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Applicant denied that he is delinquent on his state taxes. He claimed \nthat those taxes are being paid under the Chapter 13 payment plan.8 \n \nApplicant testified about the circumstances that led to his financial problems. \nBefore those problems arose, his wife was employed as a nurse educator, one who taught \nhealth education to at-risk patients. At the end of 2009 or early 2010, her employer \nunexpectedly eliminated her full-time position and cut her back to 16 hours per week. At \nthe time, she was making about $75,000 per year. The cut in hours reduced her pay by \nmore than 50%.9  \n \nAs a result, Applicant fell behind on the home mortgage and immediately applied \nfor a loan modification. The mortgage company told him that he had to be three or more \nmonths in default in order to do a modification. So, with that advice, Applicant stopped \nmaking payments for three months and reapplied. Then the mortgage company said that \nin order to do a modification, he would need to pay those three months of arrears. \nApplicant could not afford to do so. The mortgage company told Applicant he could apply \nfor the Making Housing Affordable program.  He did, and that was denied, as well. In \nshort, Applicant applied for some form of relief from the mortgage company several times. \nAll were denied.10 \n \nIn May 2010, Applicant\u2019s wife took another nursing job, but even though it was full \ntime, it was not permanent, and the employer had to renew her job every three months. \nIn addition, it was not a wage-paying job, but was a 1099 independent contractor position. \n                                                          \n \n6 Answer \u00b6 1.c. \n \n7 Answer \u00b6 1.d. \n \n8 Answer \u00b6 1.e. \n \n9 Tr. 13-14. 37.  \n \n10 Tr. 14-18; Answer \u00b6 1.b. The grounds for each denial appear to be pretextual, especially since the \nmortgage company continued to urge Applicant to reapply after each denial (e.g., insufficient employment \nhistory, inadequate tax returns, inter alia). In fact, the mortgage company was ultimately successfully sued \nin a class action suit for predatory lending practices. Tr. 15, 34. Applicant was awarded damages of $1,000.   \n \n \n\n4 \n \nThe employer, therefore, was not withholding state and federal income taxes. Applicant \nand his wife, by miscalculation, underwithheld taxes. This caused some but not all of \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies.11  \n \nIn accordance with the mortgage company\u2019s instruction about needing to be in \ndefault to reapply for a loan modification, Applicant continued not making mortgage \npayments. In July 2012, the mortgage company began foreclosure proceedings. \nApplicant retained counsel and reapplied for a loan remediation. That was denied. On \nadvice of counsel, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in November 2012 to stay the \nforeclosure. At about the same time, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s left her month-to-month job and \ntook a full-time permanent job at a nursing home.12  \n \nAt about the time the Chapter 13 was approved by the court (November 2012), \nApplicant\u2019s employer chose to consolidate the operations of three facilities. Applicant was \na supervisor at one of those facilities. The consolidation reduced the number of \nsupervisors from 12 to 7. Applicant was making $118,000 per year. Applicant applied for \none of those supervisory positions, but he was not awarded it. As a result he took a job \nwith another defense contractor in June 2013 at $125,000 per year. Applicant worked for \nthat defense contractor until April 2014, when he was laid off due to a reduction in the \nworkforce. He was given a two-month severance and a bonus.13  \n \nEven after being laid off in April 2014, Applicant was still making his mortgage \npayments (and paying other debts) through the Chapter 13 trustee. He accomplished that \nby withdrawing money from his 401(k) plan. That would ultimately lead to enhanced tax \nliabilities, because Applicant was under the age of 55, and those withdrawals were taxed \nas ordinary income plus a 20% penalty. That contributed significantly to Applicant\u2019s \nincome tax liabilities.14 \n \nBy November 2013, Applicant had consumed all of his liquid finances to stay \ncurrent with his Chapter 13 payments. His counsel recommended that Applicant convert \nthe Chapter 13 to a Chapter 7. The goal was to get a clean start. That was not what \nhappened, because his original bankruptcy lawyer recommended that Applicant\u2019s wife \nnot join him in the Chapter 13 proceeding, in order to protect her credit rating. His wife, \nhowever, although not on the deed was liable on the mortgage note. Therefore, she was \nnot protected by Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13. In hindsight, Applicant believed he received bad \nlegal advice not to include his wife in the Chapter 13. Applicant converted the Chapter 13 \nto a Chapter 7 in November 2014.15 The Chapter 7 was discharged in February 2015. \nNot long after that discharge, the mortgage company started foreclosure proceeding \n                                                          \n11 Tr. 16-17.  \n \n12 Tr. 17-19.  \n \n13 GE 1; Tr. 21-22.  \n \n14 Tr. 22-23.  \n15 At that time, Applicant was still unemployed. GE 1.   \n \n\n5 \n \nagainst Applicant\u2019s wife, because she had not been on the Chapter 13 or the Chapter 7 \nand, therefore, had no protection from liability on the mortgage note.16   \n \nIn January 2015, the defense contractor who had laid him off in June 2013 rehired \nhim at about $111,000 (which included an $8,000 signing bonus), which was a reduction \nfrom the $125,000 salary he was receiving before his last employer laid him off. In March \n2015, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 to stay the foreclosure proceeding that the mortgage \ncompany had started against his wife. That Chapter 13 is still active today.  The mortgage \ncompany\u2019s foreclosure suit has been suspended in light of the Chapter 13. The state has \nrepeatedly moved to dismiss the foreclosure suit, but the mortgage company responds \nby requesting that the suit\u2019s suspension be extended for 90 days, and the state repeatedly \nagrees to those requests.17 \n \nApplicant testified about the status of his currently active Chapter 13. All of the \nSOR debts (Federal tax debts and state tax debt through 2015) and the mortgage \ncompany debt (not alleged in the SOR) are included in the Chapter 13 payment plan. He \nhas never been delinquent on his plan payments. He has $1,170 automatically deducted \nevery two weeks to pay to the plan. Applicant is two months ahead on plan payments. \nApplicant submitted documentation showing those payments from June 2015 through the \ndate of the hearing. He exits the plan in March 2020.18  \n \nApplicant testified about his reasons he filed his first bankruptcy. In 2012, \nApplicant\u2019s home was seriously \u201cunderwater.\u201d In July 2012, the mortgage company filed \na foreclosure suit. Applicant knew that if the mortgage company successfully foreclosed \non his home, there would be a substantial deficiency owed. Because Applicant could not \npay that deficiency, he would be defaulted. His credit rating would have prevented him \nfrom purchasing another home. Applicant\u2019s four children were deeply rooted in the \ncommunity. In short, Applicant would have lost money and would not have been able to \nprovide housing for his family. Filing a Chapter 13 in November 2012 stayed the \nforeclosure and prevented those detrimental results. Applicant converted that Chapter 13 \nto a Chapter 7, because, as noted, by November 2013 Applicant had depleted his liquid \nassets to make the Chapter 13 plan payments.19 \n \nApplicant testified about is current finances. Applicant makes about $103,000 per \nyear but recently was given a 5% raise. His wife makes $93,000 per year, and last year \nshe was given a performance bonus. He has made no large purchases. Applicant\u2019s two \nchildren in college have partial scholarships, have taken student loans, or otherwise have \npaid for themselves. He has not co-signed any student loans because of the Chapter 13. \nHe has three autos, a 2003 car with 110,000 miles, a 2002 car with 315,000 miles, and a \ncar with 267,000 miles. They are all paid off. Applicant does all his own car maintenance \n                                                          \n16 Tr. 23-24.  \n \n17 Tr. 24-26. \n  \n18 Tr. 25-30, 49-50; AE B, C, and D. \n \n19 Tr. 18, 34-35.  \n\n6 \n \nto save money. He is current on his 2016 and 2017 taxes. Applicant and his wife manage \ntheir household expenses and \u201cwatch every penny.\u201d20  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to authorize \nsuch access. E.O. 10865 \u00a7 2; SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, \nconsidering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial \ndecision. SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(c), 2(d). \n \nDepartment Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \nAdministrative Judges are responsible for ensuring that an applicant receives fair \nnotice of the issues raised, has a reasonable opportunity to litigate those issues, and is \nnot subjected to unfair surprise. ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). \nIn resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility, \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(b). See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n20 Tr. 24, 30-32, 50-51. Counsel for Applicant will be paid at the end of the Chapter 13 proceeding, and that \nwill be worked out with Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy counsel.   \n\n7 \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has a number of delinquent debts, which \npurportedly raise a security concern under Guideline F. The financial considerations \nsecurity concern is explained at AG \u00b6 18, which in pertinent part, states: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  \n \n Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial \nissues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality \nto pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to \ndelinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person\u2019s \nself-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.21 \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following pertinent disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n AG \u00b6 19(f): failure . . . to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n                                                          \n21 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).  \n \n\n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection process. Rather, \nmy obligation is to examine the way an applicant handles his or her personal \nfinancial obligations to assess how he or she may handle their security \nobligations.22 Here, Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility was called into \nquestion by his two bankruptcies and his past state and federal income tax \ndelinquencies. I conclude that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f) \napply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s financial woes began in late 2009 or early 2010 when his wife\u2019s \nemployer unexpectedly eliminated her full-time job and severely cut her hours back by \nmore than 50%. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by an unusual chain of bad \ncircumstances largely beyond his control and unlikely to recur. Filing Chapter 13 and \nstaying current on plan payments was responsible conduct under the adverse financial \nconditions Applicant was confronting. Applicant is financially prudent and is current with \nhis taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (g) apply.23    \n \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.24 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion \nto show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      For Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \n \n \n    For Applicant \n                                                          \n22 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016). \n \n23 Applicant\u2019s loss of employment and his wife\u2019s loss of employment are circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol, which mitigates the filing of Chapter 13 bankruptcies to protect their home from foreclosure under \nAG \u00b6 20(b). Failure to pay income taxes, while understandable under these circumstances, is not \nresponsible conduct under AG \u00b6 20(b). Therefore, Applicant gets only partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant\u2019s current Chapter 13 plan, although it includes payments of back taxes, is not technically an \narrangement with the appropriate tax authorities. I find, however, that it is the functional equivalent of such \nan arrangement such that AG \u00b6 20(g) applies.    \n \n24 AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  \n\n9 \n \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to classified information. \n \n  \n____________________ \nPhilip J.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified, called four witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F, \nwhich were admitted in evidence without objection.  \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open until June 28, 2018, for the receipt \nof additional evidence. Applicant timely provided documentation, which I marked as AE \nG and admitted in evidence without objection. I marked Department Counsel\u2019s email, in \nwhich he indicated no objection to Applicant\u2019s additional evidence, as HE IV. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 25, 2018.                                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations with the exception of SOR \u00b6 2.a, which \nhe denied. He is 37 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he had never been married \nand he did not have any children.1 \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1999 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2005. He has worked for various defense contractors since 2008. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since 2016. He has held a security clearance \nsince 2009.2  \n \n \nApplicant started consuming alcohol at age 15. In July 1999, at age 18, he was \ncharged with driving under the influence (DUI) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a). This was his first DUI. \nThough his blood alcohol content (BAC) was under the legal limit, he was convicted of \nDUI due to a zero tolerance violation for consuming alcohol as a minor. His driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended for six months, he was ordered to complete a six-month alcohol \nprogram, and he was fined $100.3   \n \n \nIn July 2001, at age 20, Applicant was charged and convicted of underage \npossession of alcohol. He was in college and he threw a party where alcohol was \npresent. He was sentenced to one year probation, 50 hours community service, and \nalcohol counseling (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a). He completed individual alcohol counseling from \nAugust to December 2001. During this period, he consumed beer a few times weekly.4   \n \n                                                     \n1 Response to the SOR; Tr. at 20, 90; GE 1, 2. \n  \n2 Response to the SOR; Tr. at 7, 20-22, 44, 63, 78; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 22-23, 42-44, 61-62, 65, 78-81; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. \n \n4 Tr. at 23, 42-44, 62-63, 65, 80-81; GE 1, 2, 4, 6. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn December 2005, Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI), \nBAC .15% to .20%, 1st offense. This was his second and last alcohol-related offense \nwhile driving. He had a few drinks while watching football at a bar. As he was driving to \nhis parents\u2019 home, he hit a patch of ice and his car slid into a ditch. A police officer \nasked him if he had been drinking and he said \u201cYes.\u201d He was convicted of reckless \ndriving and fined $250 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.a). He consumed two to three beers three to four \ntimes weekly during this period.5  \n \n \nIn June 2012, Applicant was disciplined for reporting to work hungover and \nsmelling of alcohol. He had consumed alcohol the night before. This was his first and \nonly alcohol-related incident at work. He was consequently involuntarily terminated from \nemployment in August 2012 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 2.a). He consumed six beers daily during this \nperiod. He also started drinking hard liquor in October 2010, after his long-term \nrelationship of five years ended; he found himself battling depression; he isolated \nhimself; and he used alcohol as a coping mechanism. His mother testified that she \nobserved Applicant begin to binge drink on the weekends in 2010, which had not been \nhis normal behavior. He also withdrew from participating in family events and he did not \nanswer her telephone calls.6  \n \n \nIn October 2012, Applicant was charged and convicted of drunk in public (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.a). He was fined $25. He was walking to his residence from a convenience \nstore when the police stopped him because he was stumbling. When the police asked \nhim if he had been drinking, he said \u201cYes.\u201d The police arrested him, took him to the \npolice station, and advised him to pay the fine, which he did. He consumed two beers \ndaily and more on the weekends from June to October 2012. He was still in denial about \nhis alcoholism.7 \n \n \nBy March 2014, Applicant\u2019s level of alcohol consumption had escalated. He \nconsumed primarily hard liquor, and \u201cmore than the average person drinks in a sitting.\u201d \nHe asked his mother for help and she took him to the emergency room, where he was \nheld until a bed was available for him at an addiction treatment services program. His \nBAC was .392%. He disclosed his family history of alcoholism. For the first time and for \nfour days, he received inpatient alcohol treatment. He was diagnosed with alcohol \ndependence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 2.a).8 \n \n \nAfter completing treatment, Applicant was sober for one month. He then resumed \nconsuming alcohol. By his November 2014 background interview, he consumed alcohol \napproximately two times weekly (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 2.a). By April 2015, his alcohol \nconsumption had escalated to an average of eight to twelve drinks daily, prompting him \nto again contact his mother for help. She helped him enroll in a 28-day inpatient alcohol \n                                                     \n5 Tr. at 23-24, 42-44, 63-65, 78-79, 82; GE 1, 2, 4, 6. \n \n6 Tr. at 24, 42-44, 51, 65-69, 83-85, 118-127; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 7. \n \n7 Tr. at 24-25, 42-44, 67-69, 82; GE 2, 4, 7. \n \n8 Tr. at 25-27, 42-44, 69-72, 81-83, 118-127; GE 3, 4, 7. \n\n \n4 \n \ntreatment program at an addiction treatment center. He received treatment through May \n2015, and he was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, continuous (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 2.a).9  \n \n \nApplicant has been sober since the day he entered the April 2015 treatment \nprogram. Though he knew he had an issue with alcohol when he enrolled in the March \n2014 treatment program, he had neither accepted that he is an alcoholic nor taken \nresponsibility for such knowledge and his recovery until April 2015. He testified that the \nday he entered the April 2015 treatment program was: \n \n[A] pivot point for me . . . a moment of clarity, that there was a lot more to \nmy life that I could be doing, and that I needed to ask for help. I found \nstrength in asking for help, that I couldn\u2019t find within, and I sought \ntreatment that day. \n \nDuring his final week at the 2015 treatment program, he was elected the male \ncommunity representative--a role through which he helped the other men in the \nprogram.10 \n \n \nApplicant complied with the recommendations of his treatment counselor after his \n2015 discharge from the treatment program: he attended 90 Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) meetings in 90 days; he obtained an AA sponsor; and he saw a licensed \nprofessional counselor weekly. As of the date of the hearing, he was still attending AA \ndaily; he was in daily contact with his AA sponsor; he was also in daily contact as a \nsponsor for an individual in recovery; and he was seeing his licensed professional \ncounselor weekly to biweekly. In 2016, the counselor diagnosed him with alcohol \ndependence in full sustained remission. He intended to continue attending AA, \nremaining active in his AA community, and seeing his counselor, whom he viewed as a \ncoach that has taught him different coping strategies for life\u2019s stressors.11 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he learned through both the 2015 treatment program and \nAA that his previous failure to remain sober hinged on his thinking that he could handle \nhis alcoholism on his own, rather than reach out to others for help. He also learned that \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t drink safely or like other people could, and that I was fully alcoholic\u201d and \n\u201cthere are consequences when I drink.\u201d A friend from AA since 2016 testified that \nApplicant is a \u201crock\u2026 [h]e knows what to do and he does it consistently and he does it \nalways.\u201d12 \n \n \n \nApplicant signed a statement of intent in June 2018 to abstain from using alcohol \non penalty of losing his security clearance. He testified that he now has a social life, and \nhe enjoys fishing, playing guitar, and reading books. He is also a part of his family\u2019s \n                                                     \n9 Tr. at 25-32, 42-44, 72-74, 88, 116-127; GE 3, 4, 5. \n \n10 Tr. at 28-39, 41-42, 45-47, 52-60, 73-78, 85-98, 116-138; AE A, D, G. \n \n11 Tr. at 32-39, 41-42, 45-47, 52-60, 75-78, 85-98, 116-138; AE A, D, G. \n \n12 Tr. at 28-39, 41-42, 45-47, 52-60, 73-78, 85-98, 116-138; AE A, D, G. \n\n \n5 \n \nlives, talking to his mother often, spending a lot of time with his father, and he values \nbeing involved as an uncle to four minor children.13  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor from September 2016 to December 2017 is a retired \nbrigadier general and a former deputy director for a federal government agency from \n2014 to 2015. As of the date of the hearing, he was the vice president for a business \nunit within the company. He testified that he first met Applicant in 2014, when Applicant \nworked for him as an executive assistant in a contractor capacity until 2015, when the \nwitness left the government agency. He then hired Applicant to work for him at their \ncurrent company in 2016. He described Applicant as an outstanding performer. He \nidentified Applicant as a high potential employee and gave him a top performance rating \nin 2017.14  \n \n \nThe witness testified that he first became aware of Applicant\u2019s challenges with \nalcohol in 2014. The witness testified that Applicant\u2019s mother also informed him about \nApplicant\u2019s 2015 treatment for alcoholism the day Applicant entered the program, and \nhe observed Applicant\u2019s impressive work performance when Applicant returned to work \nafter completing treatment. The witness also testified that he reviewed the SOR, and \nApplicant was forthright about his issues with alcohol and his efforts to address them. \nWhile the witness was aware of Applicant\u2019s history with alcohol, he testified that he did \nnot believe that anyone else at work was and that there was some speculation among \nseveral individuals at their prior job of Applicant\u2019s challenges. The witness testified that \nhe has seen Applicant on numerous occasions in social situations where alcohol is \npresent, and described Applicant as firm in his decision to not consume alcohol. The \nwitness indicated that he had no doubts that Applicant has turned his life around. \nNumerous professional and social character references describe Applicant as a superb \nemployee and a man of exemplary character, with demonstrated integrity and \ntrustworthiness.15 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n                                                     \n13 Tr. at 40-42, 44-45, 47-52, 54, 56, 58-60, 89, 91, 116-127; AE B, C, D, E, F. \n \n14 Tr. at 44-45, 74, 98-116; AE B, C, D, E. \n \n15 Tr. at 44-45, 74, 98-116; AE B, C, D, E. \n\n \n6 \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nApplicant has a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nconvictions. He was also terminated from employment in 2012 after reporting to work \nhungover and smelling of alcohol. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence when he \nreceived inpatient alcohol treatment in 2014, yet he maintained sobriety for only one \nmonth before he began drinking again. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), and 22(f) \nare applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant relapsed after he received alcohol treatment in 2014 and was \ndiagnosed with alcohol dependence. As such, AG \u00b6 23(c) does not apply. However, \nApplicant has been sober since his April 2015 entrance into a 28-day inpatient alcohol \ntreatment program. He accepted then that he is an alcoholic, and he took responsibility \nfor such knowledge as well as his recovery. He completed the 2015 treatment program \nand he complied with the counselor\u2019s recommendations upon discharge. He has seen a \nlicensed professional counselor weekly to biweekly since 2015, and the counselor \ndiagnosed him in 2016 with alcohol dependence in full sustained remission. He \nattended 90 AA meetings in 90 days, he has since attended AA daily, and he intends to \ncontinue to attend AA in the future. He has an AA sponsor and he is an AA sponsor for \nanother individual in recovery. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) are established. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 16. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s  \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nconvictions, his 2012 employment termination after reporting to work hungover and \nsmelling of alcohol, and his relapse one month after his 2014 alcohol treatment and \nalcohol dependence diagnosis reflect questionable judgment and unreliability. His \nformer supervisor testified that Applicant\u2019s history with alcohol is not commonly known \nby others at work. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) apply. \n\n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides the following conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline G analysis, I find that \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the alcohol consumption and personal conduct security concerns.  \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2009 which was dismissed in 2012, that he has 40 delinquent debts totaling $66,165, and that between 1990 and 2014, he was arrested and charged with fraudulently issuing worthless checks. The debts include: 25 medical accounts totaling $5,284; mortgage-loan arrearages of $9,376; deficiency balances on three repossessed vehicles totaling $37,498; an $8,222 judgment; and several small consumer accounts. In his Answer, Applicant admits the bankruptcy and the 25 medical debts and 8 of the other debts, denies 7 of the debts, and admits the worthless checks charges. The debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) from July 2017 and February 2017. (GX 4; GX 3.) His admissions in his Answer are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 53-year-old program analyst currently employed by a defense contractor since October 2016, and periodically employed in the defense industry since 2007. He and his wife married in 1991 and have a 13-year-old son. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a security clearance. (GX 1.) After high school, Applicant worked for a local manufacturing plant for many years and was generally able to support his family on his income. In 1999, Applicant\u2019s wife opened her own business, which she continues to operate. Her income from the business is minimal and unreliable, and sometimes she does not generate any income.

However, Applicant did not \nintentionally issue worthless checks and repaid the amounts owed, and otherwise \nmitigated the financial concern by acting responsibly under the circumstances. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on November 3, 2016. \nOn July 25, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n03/19/2019\n\n \n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on August 8, 2017, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on November 1, \n2017, and the case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 21, 2018, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 6, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D were admitted without objection. I left the record \nopen until June 20, 2018, to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. \nHe timely submitted AX D and AX E, which I have admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2009 which was \ndismissed in 2012, that he has 40 delinquent debts totaling $66,165, and that between \n1990 and 2014, he was arrested and charged with fraudulently issuing worthless checks. \nThe debts include: 25 medical accounts totaling $5,284; mortgage-loan arrearages of \n$9,376; deficiency balances on three repossessed vehicles totaling $37,498; an $8,222 \njudgment; and several small consumer accounts. In his Answer, Applicant admits the \nbankruptcy and the 25 medical debts and 8 of the other debts, denies 7 of the debts, and \nadmits the worthless checks charges. The debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau \nreports (CBR) from July 2017 and February 2017. (GX 4; GX 3.) His admissions in his \nAnswer are incorporated in my findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old program analyst currently employed by a defense \ncontractor since October 2016, and periodically employed in the defense industry since \n2007. He and his wife married in 1991 and have a 13-year-old son. This is Applicant\u2019s \nfirst application for a security clearance. (GX 1.)  \n \n \nAfter high school, Applicant worked for a local manufacturing plant for many years \nand was generally able to support his family on his income. In 1999, Applicant\u2019s wife \nopened her own business, which she continues to operate. Her income from the business \nis minimal and unreliable, and sometimes she does not generate any income. When the \nmanufacturing plant closed in 2003, Applicant was initially unemployed. He worked odd \njobs and used his savings to support his family. In an effort to increase his employability, \nApplicant enrolled in college in 2008. He graduated in 2012 with a bachelor\u2019s degree, and \nhas been taking master\u2019s degree level courses since June 2016. (GX 1; Tr. 18; Tr. 20-21; \nTr. 23.)  \n \n \nBetween 2007 and 2012, Applicant worked for a federal contractor in a low-paying, \nunskilled position. Due to ongoing financial strains, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nin December 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). From 2009 until September 2012, Applicant paid \napproximately $1,500 a month on his bankruptcy payment plan through an automated \npayroll deduction. He was laid off from his federal contractor job in September 2012 and \nwas financially incapable of maintaining the payments while providing basic living \n\n \n3\nnecessities for his family. The bankruptcy was dismissed for noncompliance with the \npayment plan in April 2013. (Tr. 30; GX 3.) \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from September 2012 to February 2013; from \nSeptember 2014 to March 2015, and from January 2016 to September 2016 (Tr. 19-20; \nGX 1.) He was unable to afford health insurance during the periods of unemployment, \nand primarily due to his wife\u2019s and his son\u2019s chronic medical issues, incurred numerous \nmedical debts. (Tr. 72-73.) \n \nApplicant denies liability for the $10,201 vehicle-loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.w. \nApplicant\u2019s vehicle was repossessed for nonpayment after he had been laid off for more \nthan 10 months. He initially negotiated repayment arrangements with the creditor, \nhowever, the creditor reneged on the agreement. (Answer.) Despite Applicant\u2019s position \nconcerning this debt, the creditor sent Applicant a 1099-C Cancellation of Debt, which \nApplicant properly filed and paid the appropriate taxes for the forgiven debt amount. (Tr. \n39-40.) This debt has been resolved. \n \nApplicant denies the $8,222 judgment entered against him in November 2010 by \na merchandise-franchising company. (SOR \u00b6 1.dd.) Applicant considered entering a \nbusiness venture with the company. The company requested Applicant\u2019s personal contact \ninformation for the stated purpose of sending Applicant an invitation to a vendor show. At \nthe show, Applicant collected information about the company, but did not sign a contract \nor make any other commitments to enter into a business venture with it. Without his \npermission, the company shipped merchandise and supplies to Applicant. He attempted, \nwithout success, to return the shipments. Applicant\u2019s calls and letters to the company \nwent unanswered or unreturned. The company eventually stopped sending merchandise \nto Applicant, but he received an invoice demanding payment for the merchandise he \nreceived and was unable to return. He refused to pay the invoice, but again stated his \nwillingness to return the items.  \n \n \nThe company sought a judgment against Applicant. Applicant was served by the \nsheriff, and began in earnest trying to reach representatives from the company in order \nto prevent the matter from going to court. Applicant did not appear in court because he \ndid not understand the process or the consequences of his failure to appear. (Tr. 47-48.) \nA default judgment was entered against Applicant for the full amount in November 2010. \nHowever, the company did not pursue collection of the default judgment and the judgment \ndoes not appear on Applicant\u2019s July 2017 CBR. (GX 4.) \n \n \nApplicant has paid $15,060, through garnishment of $200 per pay period, on the \n$16,367 judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ee. Applicant purchased a vehicle which never ran \nproperly. He voluntarily relinquished the vehicle to the seller, which sought and was \ngranted a judgment against Applicant for the vehicle-loan balance. (AX A; Tr. 48-49.) This \ndebt is being resolved. \n \n \nApplicant paid the past due balance of $9,376 (SOR \u00b6 1.hh) owed for his mortgage-\nloan through a six-month repayment agreement with the mortgage lender which was \n\n \n4\ncompleted in June 2017. He is occasionally late with his mortgage-loan payments, but \nhas not fallen into arrears since satisfying his repayment plan. (GX 4; Tr. 51- 52.) This \ndebt has been resolved. \n \n \nIn early 2018, Applicant contracted with the credit-repair firm in an effort to resolve \nhis delinquent accounts. Due to the high fees, Applicant terminated his relationship with \nthe firm and attempted to resolve his delinquent accounts on his own by contacting many \nof the creditors and attempting to enter repayment plans. His efforts were not particularly \nsuccessful, and he again retained the credit repair firm in May 2018. (Tr. 37-39.) The $762 \nand $527 consumer debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.bb and 1.cc were paid through the credit-\nrepair firm. Applicant disputed the $424 consumer debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.gg and the \n$200 and $70 medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.ll and 1.mm through the credit-repair \nfirm and they have been removed from Applicant\u2019s CBR. (AX B; Tr. 32-33.) \n \n \nApplicant denies the $959 and $568 cellular-telephone services debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p. Applicant changed service carriers with the understanding that the \nnew service carrier would buy out any remaining contractual obligation Applicant had with \nthe previous service carrier, and that both service carriers were paid in full through such \nan agreement. Several months after changing carriers, Applicant received a list of \ncharges, but no explanation, from each of the carriers. He is disputing these debts through \nthe credit-repair firm. (Tr. 36-38; Answer.) \n \n \n  Applicant has contacted the creditors of the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.n, 1.q through 1.s, 1.u, 1.v, 1.ii through 1.kk, and 1.nn, and will begin repayment \nof these accounts as soon he is able. (Tr. 35-36; Tr. 38; Tr. 42.) Applicant contacted the \ncreditor for the $10,930 delinquent vehicle-lease debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.aa, and stated \nthat it was his intention to enter a repayment plan once his medical debts were resolved. \n(Tr. 41.) Applicant contacted the creditor for the $588 payday loan (SOR \u00b6 1.t) and is \nnegotiating payment arrangements. The $506 past-due debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.z is for \na one-month arrearage on the vehicle loan for Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s vehicle. She has regular \ncontact with the creditor and is working to bring this account current. (Tr. 41-42.)  \n \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s wife periodically failed to timely file her quarterly tax \nreturns for her business and was delinquent on her tax payments. Applicant established \na payment plan with the IRS and the IRS also withheld Applicant\u2019s tax refunds for several \nyears to offset the balance due. The IRS contacted Applicant several years ago to inform \nhim that the account had been placed in a non-collectible status. Applicant recently \ncontacted the IRS and was informed that there is no current balance due. (AX F; Tr. 62-\n64.) \n \nIn 1990, 2009, and 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with fraudulently \nissuing worthless checks. In each instance, Applicant was experiencing financial strains \nand wrote checks for necessities, usually groceries, with the intention of depositing money \ninto his checking account to ensure that the checks would clear. However, he was unable \nto do so and the checks bounced. Applicant made full restitution and paid the requisite \ncourt costs. Applicant never intended to commit a fraudulent or illegal act, is remorseful \n\n \n5\nabout these mistakes and is actively more diligent about monitoring his checking account \nbalance. (Tr. 56-58.) \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts were incurred prior to Applicant\u2019s current employment, \nwhich began in October 2016. (GX 4.) Applicant lives within his means, has not incurred \nany recent delinquent debts, and is able to maintain his ongoing financial obligations as \nwell as unusual expenses such as uniforms or other costs associated with his son\u2019s \nextracurricular activities. (Tr. 73.) Applicant is also paying $100 a month for a $2,000 \njudgment for past-due homeowner\u2019s association dues. When Applicant purchased his \nhome, the seller did not disclose the requirement of homeowner\u2019s association dues, and \nit was several years before Applicant was aware of the requirement. (Tr. 24-25; Tr. 60-\n61.) Applicant works part time as a pastor and receives a biweekly donation of \napproximately $200. He also sporadically earns about $100 a week when working for a \nfriend with a lawn-care service. (Tr. 66-68.) Applicant intends to resolve his remaining \ndelinquent accounts. He was sincere and credible while testifying. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \n\n \n6\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n7\n \nThe record evidence establishes three disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(d): deceptive or illegal financial practices such as . . . check fraud. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s past financial problems were attributable to matters largely beyond his \ncontrol. Specifically, he experienced a sustained period of underemployment and three \nperiods of unemployment that resulted in his inability to maintain his financial obligations. \nInitially, Applicant acted responsibly by reorganizing his debts through Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, into which he paid $1,500 a month between 2009 and 2013, until he could \nno longer afford the payments because he was unemployed. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s wife \nand son both have chronic medical conditions that require frequent medical treatment. \nBecause Applicant could not afford insurance while unemployed, he incurred substantial \nmedical debt. It is significant that all of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts were incurred prior to \nstarting his current employment in 2016 and that more than half of the delinquent \naccounts are medical debts. Applicant has not incurred any delinquent debts since \ngaining his current employment and health insurance coverage. \n \n \nAfter the manufacturing plant closed in 2003, Applicant invested in his future by \nearning a bachelor\u2019s degree and taking coursework towards a master\u2019s degree. Since he \ngained more lucrative employment, Applicant has begun addressing his delinquent \naccounts within his means. He engaged the services of a credit-repair firm to assist him \n\n \n8\nin resolving his past-due debts, and has paid had four debts and has had four debts \nsuccessfully removed from his CBR. He has contacted a number of his creditors on his \nown with the intention of establishing repayment plans. He entered and satisfied a six-\nmonth repayment plan with his mortgage-loan creditor and has resolved the $9,376 \narrearage alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.hh.  The creditor for the $10,201 delinquent vehicle-lease \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.w) forgave the debt and Applicant properly filed the IRS 1099-C and paid \nthe appropriate taxes. He has paid over $15,000 through garnishment on the $16,367 \njudgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ee. Although this debt is being resolved through \ngarnishment, the fact that a debt is paid through garnishment does not bar mitigation of \nfinancial concerns. ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep 26, 2006). Applicant \nis also voluntarily paying a $2,000 non-SOR judgment. \n \n \nApplicant is working with a credit-repair firm to pay or dispute several of his \nremaining delinquent accounts and has resolved five SOR debts through its services. He \nwill pay the remaining delinquent accounts as soon as he is able. Applicant initially acted \nin good faith by filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy and maintaining his payments for nearly four \nyears. After incurring delinquent debt due to circumstances largely beyond his control, he \nhas continued to act in good faith by contacting his creditors, engaging a credit-repair firm \nand paying or successfully disputing a number of debts, rehabilitating his mortgage-loan, \nand otherwise addressing his delinquent debts. He also works part-time as a pastor and \nlawn-service worker to earn additional income.  \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \n \nApplicant has not incurred any delinquent debt since 2016 and is working to \nresolve those accounts which remain outstanding. Applicant now maintains health \ninsurance. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies were not due to frivolous or irresponsible \nspending. Although Applicant experienced past financial issues, he established and \ninstituted a plan to pay or otherwise resolve his delinquent debts, and lives within his \nmeans. Although Applicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, he has made a good-faith effort to \nrepay or successfully dispute his debts and has established a plan to resolve his financial \nissues within his means. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) apply.  \n \n \nOn three occasions between 1990 and 2014, Applicant unintentionally issued \nworthless checks. He made restitution and paid the requisite court costs. He is remorseful \nabout these mistakes and has instituted safeguards to prevent it from happening again. \nThe last instance of issuing a worthless check occurred nearly five years ago. This \n\n \n9\nconduct is was infrequent and occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on Applicant=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-person concept, \nan administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by \nconsidering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. An \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2, but have also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant invested in his future by graduating from college and working towards a \ngraduate degree. That investment resulted in more stable and lucrative employment. \nWhile Applicant and his wife have experienced some tax-related delinquencies in the \npast, they initially worked with the IRS and entered a repayment plan. That plan has since \nbeen suspended by the IRS and Applicant does not owe a balance on his tax account. \nApplicant is active in his community as a part-time pastor, and periodically works an \nadditional part-time job to help with the household finances.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his financial circumstances. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.rr:  \n \n \nFor Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 45 years old and married, with two children. He earned a GED in July 1991, and a certificate from a technical/trade school in February 2002. He has held his present employment with a defense contractor since February 2002, and is seeking to continue the security clearance he has held since 2005 in connection with that position. He has no military service or Federal Government employment. (Item 3.) Applicant admitted owing delinquent Federal income taxes for each year from 2012 through 2016, totaling $27,578, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. (Item 2.) The amounts due were based on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) account transcripts that he obtained on June 5, 2017, and submitted 14 days later in his response to DOHA interrogatories. (Item 4.) These delinquent taxes remain largely unpaid and outstanding according to all record evidence. Applicant entered into several short-lived installment/repayment agreements with the IRS concerning these taxes, which ended after his attempted payments were dishonored. He attributed his initial tax problems to an audit of his 2012 and 2013 tax returns, on which he had claimed and received substantial refunds, but actually owed a combined $12,658 in unpaid taxes. He blamed subsequent deficiencies on under-withholding and his family\u2019s routine spending in excess of available income.

Blazewick, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant owes more than $32,000 in delinquent Federal and state income tax \ndebt, and recently filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to \u201cmanage\u201d the surrender of his home \nin lieu of foreclosure. He offered insufficient evidence of efforts or means to resolve his \nremaining delinquencies, or to demonstrate rehabilitation. Resulting security concerns \nwere not mitigated. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national security \neligibility is denied.  \nStatement of Case \nOn October 23, 2015, Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP). (Item 3.) On June 29, 2017, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline F: Financial \nConsiderations. (Item 1.) The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \n01/04/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, that became effective for all Executive Branch \nagencies on June 8, 2017.1 \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 25, 2017, and requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 2.) On \nSeptember 5, 2017, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing eight Items, was \nmailed to Applicant on September 7, 2017, and received by him on September 18, \n2017. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of \nthe FORM. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney submitted five documents in response to the \nFORM, on Applicant\u2019s behalf, with an explanatory cover letter dated October 7, 2017. \nThis submission is marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, and Department Counsel had no \nobjection to its admissibility. Applicant did not submit any other response to the FORM, \ndid not file any objection to its contents, and did not request additional time to respond \nbeyond the 30-day period. AE A and Items 1 through 8 are admitted in evidence. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old and married, with two children. He earned a GED in \nJuly 1991, and a certificate from a technical/trade school in February 2002. He has held \nhis present employment with a defense contractor since February 2002, and is seeking \nto continue the security clearance he has held since 2005 in connection with that \nposition. He has no military service or Federal Government employment. (Item 3.)  \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing delinquent Federal income taxes for each year from \n2012 through 2016, totaling $27,578, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. (Item 2.) \nThe amounts due were based on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) account transcripts \nthat he obtained on June 5, 2017, and submitted 14 days later in his response to DOHA \ninterrogatories. (Item 4.) These delinquent taxes remain largely unpaid and outstanding \naccording to all record evidence. Applicant entered into several short-lived \ninstallment/repayment agreements with the IRS concerning these taxes, which ended \nafter his attempted payments were dishonored. He attributed his initial tax problems to \nan audit of his 2012 and 2013 tax returns, on which he had claimed and received \nsubstantial refunds, but actually owed a combined $12,658 in unpaid taxes. He blamed \nsubsequent deficiencies on under-withholding and his family\u2019s routine spending in \nexcess of available income. The five IRS account transcripts for 2012 through 2016 \nreport total family joint adjusted gross income (AGI) of $701,395 over that period, for an \naverage annual AGI of $140,279. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5.) \n                                                 \n1 These guidelines were promulgated in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for use when rendering any final national \nsecurity eligibility determination. SEAD 4 \u00b6 D.7 defines \u201cNational Security Eligibility\u201d as, \u201cEligibility for \naccess to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, to include access to sensitive \ncompartmented information, restricted data, and controlled or special access program information.\u201d \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n   \nApplicant also admitted owing $4,540 in delinquent state income taxes for 2012, \n2013, and 2015, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.h, and that the state had entered a \ntax lien against him in May 2016 in the amount of $5,890. He made several payments \ntoward these state taxes under an installment plan, and provided a letter from the state \ncomptroller, dated June 5, 2017, reflecting that $4,540 remained unpaid as of that date. \nApplicant did not submit evidence of any additional payments toward his Federal or \nstate income tax debts in his October 2017 response to the FORM. (Item 2; Item 4; Item \n5; Item 7; Item 8.) \n  \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.j, that his home mortgage, with a \ntotal loan balance of $288,895, was past due in the approximate amount of $65,697.  \nThese figures were based on, and are documented by, Applicant\u2019s May 19, 2017 credit \nreport. Applicant and his wife opened this loan for $295,923 in November 2007, with \nscheduled \nmonthly \npayments \nof \n$1,984. \nThis \nwas \nan \nFHA-guaranteed \nrefinancing/equity-withdrawal loan to replace the $220,000 and $55,000 conventional \nfirst and second mortgages with which they had purchased their home in December \n2005. The first reported delinquency on the current loan payments was in July 2014, \nand the reported past-due amount comprises the succeeding 33 months of failure to \npay. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 6.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney filed a Chapter 13 petition for Applicant and his \nwife on July 12, 2017. The attorney explained: \n \nThe filing was prompted, in part, by the Debtors\u2019 inability to negotiate a \n\u201cshort sale\u201d with the lienholders on their former residence located at \n[address]. The purpose of the case is to manage debts resulting from the \nsurrender of that property and otherwise. \n \nHe reported that the five-year Chapter 13 plan had been confirmed on October 2, 2017; \nand that Applicant and his wife had been excellent clients who \u201chave every intention of \ncompleting their plan in the time allotted.\u201d Their first two $936 monthly payments were \nmade to the trustee in August and September 2017. (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant did not document any financial counseling. He did not submit the \nincome and expense schedules from his bankruptcy filing, or any other budgetary \ninformation, from which to analyze his future ability to comply with the bankruptcy plan \nwhile meeting family living expenses and repaying his income tax delinquencies. \nApplicant offered no evidence concerning the level of responsibility his duties entail in \nhis defense contractor work, or his track record with respect to handling sensitive \ninformation and observation of security procedures. I was unable to evaluate his \ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person, since he elected to have his case decided \nwithout a hearing.  \n  \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes five conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant incurred more than $32,000 in delinquent Federal and state income tax \ndebt since 2012, and about $66,000 in mortgage debt through failure to make required \npayments since July 2014. His home was foreclosed and will be surrendered to the \nlienholder under his recent bankruptcy plan. He provided insufficient financial \ninformation to clarify whether this financial irresponsibility stemmed from inability or \nunwillingness to pay these important financial obligations, despite earning over \n$700,000 during those five years. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the \nresulting security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt over the past six years is substantial, and \nhis financial irresponsibility is ongoing. His failure to demonstrate substantial progress \ntoward resolution of any of the SOR-alleged tax and mortgage debts in a meaningful \nway creates ongoing concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. He \noffered no reasonable basis to conclude that such problems will not continue or recur. \nMitigation was not established under AG \u00b6 20(a). \n  \nApplicant neither claimed that his debts arose from circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, nor showed that he acted responsibly under such circumstances, as required \nfor mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). He offered no evidence of effective financial counseling \nor budget information establishing solvency going forward, and admitted his inability to \nrepay his current delinquencies. He failed to demonstrate that these problems, in \naggregate, are being brought under control; or that a good-faith effort toward resolution \nhas actually been followed through upon for a meaningful period. This specifically \nincludes his failure to comply with several short-lived Federal and state income tax \nrepayment agreements, and insufficient evidence of payments under his most recent \nagreements if they survived his bankruptcy plan. Accordingly, Applicant did not \nestablish mitigation of financial security concerns under the provisions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), \n20(d), or 20(g). \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, \nwho is accountable for his choices. He continues to owe more than $32,000 in \ndelinquent income tax debt, and recently undertook a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan \nrequiring large monthly payments that he has no meaningful track record of being able \nto make. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished, and \nrehabilitation was not demonstrated. Overall, the evidence creates significant doubt as \nto Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He \nfailed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the Financial \nConsiderations guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n      \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a \nsensitive position is denied. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \nDAVID M.

On December 21, 2017, a complete copy of the \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, was mailed to Applicant.1 He \nreceived the FORM on December 27, 2017.

In his initial Answer to the SOR that described these facts, Applicant denied all \nof the allegations, with explanation. (Item 1, Answer) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d allege that Applicant was charged with public intoxication \nfour times between March 2000 and December 2002, while he was in college. He was \ninvolved in a bar fight during one of those incidents. Applicant disclosed the September \n2000 and October 2002 incidents during his March 2010 personal subject interview (PSI). \nDuring that interview, he claimed he had no other alcohol-related incidents or arrests, \nwhich was untrue.3 Applicant disclosed all four arrests in his December 2010 SCA, but in \nhis February 2016 SCA, he did not disclose the December 2002 incident.4 In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted the underlying conduct, but denied the allegations. He argued that all \nof these SOR allegations should have been alleged under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption) or Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). (Item 1, Answer at 4-7; Item 2 at 54-56; \nItem 3 at 6-7, 13, 22-23; Item 4 at 53-55) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged that, in February 2006, Applicant was charged with driving \nwithout a license, driving without registration, and driving on a suspended license. At the \ntime of the arrest, his license was suspended because he had several outstanding parking \ntickets and he did not have the funds to register his vehicle. He was found guilty and spent \nthree days in jail. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation, but admitted the \nunderlying conduct. (Item 1, Answer at 7-8; Item 3 at 5-6, 13, 21; Item 4 at 53) \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleged that Applicant was arrested and charged with felony-level \ndestruction of property in July 2009.

After the police left the scene, the men returned, \nand Applicant broke the window of their vehicle. He was subsequently arrested, but the \ncharges were dismissed by a judge the next day. Applicant disclosed this arrest in his \nFebruary 2016 SCA. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation, and the underlying \ncriminal conduct. Additionally, he argued that the incident should have been alleged under \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct). (Item 1, Answer at 8; Item 2 at 52-53; Item 3 at 4-5, 13, \n22; Item 4 at 52-53; Item 6 at 4) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleged that, in September 2010, Applicant purchased cocaine in the \nform of a \u201cThai stick\u201d. He was not employed at this time, but he still held a security \nclearance. He disclosed information regarding this incident in his December 2010 SCA, \nand during his 2011 PSI, and 2017 PSI. While Applicant was in Las Vegas with his \ngirlfriend on vacation, they attempted to identify drug users on the street by the way \npeople appeared, and they decided to see if they could purchase drugs from a stranger. \nApplicant asked the strangest person he saw if he could purchase cocaine from him. \nWhen the person said yes, Applicant claimed he told the individual that he was just joking, \nbecause he did not really intend to purchase drugs. However, according to Applicant, the \nindividual made Applicant go to an ATM and withdraw money for the cocaine. After the \nsale was completed, Applicant claimed he destroyed the cocaine and did not use it. In his \nAnswer, Applicant admitted the underlying conduct, but claimed he was coerced into the \npurchase. Additionally, he claimed that this incident occurred in September 2012, which \nis inconsistent with his disclosures in his 2010 SCA and 2011 PSI. Applicant asserted \nthat this allegation should have been alleged under Guideline H (Drug Involvement or \nSubstance Abuse) (Item 1, Answer at 8-9; Item 2 at 57-59; Item 3 at 14, 24, 28) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleged that, in June 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndriving while intoxicated, first offense; driving under the influence (DUI); and operating \nwhile impaired. He did not disclose this arrest in his 2016 SCA. During his February 2017 \nPSI, the investigator confronted Applicant regarding his arrest history twice, before he \nquestioned Applicant about this arrest.5 Applicant told the investigator that after leaving a \nbar, he ran a red light, and was pulled over by law enforcement. According to Applicant, \nhe passed the field sobriety test, but was arrested and taken to the police station. He \nclaimed he never heard anything from the arresting agency after the arrest. Applicant told \nthe investigator that he thought the incident was outside the reporting period. Additionally, \nhe stated he was unaware that he was charged with an offense or that the arrest would \nbe on his record. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation, because he claimed he \npassed the field sobriety tests. (Item 1, Answer at 9-10; Item 3 at 28; Item 6 at 4-5) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleged that, in November 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith reckless driving. He pled guilty to this charge in March 2014, and was ordered to pay \na $500 fine and costs. Applicant did not disclose this arrest in his 2016 SCA, or during \n                                                          \n5 Because Applicant\u2019s failure to be truthful and forthcoming with the investigator was not alleged in the SOR, \nI will only consider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole\u2013person factors. \n \n\n \n \n4 \nthe January 2017 PSI or February 2017 PSI.6 In his Answer to the SOR, he denied the \nallegation, and claimed the arresting officer did not use a radar gun; therefore, there was \nno evidence that his speeding rose to the level of reckless driving. He asserted that the \nunderlying conduct should have been alleged under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). (Item \n1, Answer at 9-10; Item 3; Item 5 at 1) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleged that Applicant used marijuana, multiple times during the summer \nof 2014, while holding a security clearance. He told the government investigator that he \nused marijuana with his siblings and their spouses. In his Answer, he denied the allegation \nbecause he believed the underlying conduct should have been alleged under Guideline \nH (Drug Involvement or Substance Misuse). Additionally, he claimed he no longer uses \nmarijuana. (Item 3 at 23-24) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k through 1.m alleged that in his February 2016 SCA, Applicant failed to \ndisclose the June 2012 DUI arrest, the January 2014 reckless driving arrest, and his 2014 \nuse of marijuana. During his February 2017 PSI, Applicant told the investigator that he \ndid not disclose his 2014 marijuana use in his February 2016 SCA because he forgot that \nhe used marijuana in 2014. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegations, because he \nclaimed he was \u201crushing when he completed the form.\u201d (Item 3 at 28) \n \nIn his supplemental Answer to the SOR and FORM, Applicant claimed he did not \ndisclose the June 2012 DUI arrest and 2014 drug use in his 2016 PSA because he \nmisunderstood the term, \u201ccharged and convicted,\u201d which does not appear in the question \nto which he falsely responded. He also claimed he did not disclose the 2014 reckless \ndriving arrest because he did not know he was fined more than $300. (AE A) \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s March 2010 PSI, Applicant discussed his earlier disclosure of \ndrug use that included use of marijuana approximately three times in October 2000, \nmushrooms two times in April 2001, and ecstasy twice in October 2001. Applicant told \nthe investigator that he did not intend to try or experiment with drugs ever again. During \nhis March 2011 PSI, Applicant reaffirmed the extent of his previous drug use, and claimed \nthat he did not intend to ever use drugs again.7 (Item 3 at 8-9, 14-15) \n \n \nIn January 2017, Applicant was confronted by an investigator regarding the full \nextent of his drug history. He admitted he used marijuana three times between 1995 and \n2003; he used mushrooms six times between March 2000 and March 2004; he used \necstasy five times between October 2001 and March 2003; and he used cocaine once in \n2000.8 (Item 3 at 23-24) \n                                                          \n6 Because Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose this arrest to the investigator was not alleged in the SOR, I will only \nconsider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole\u2013person factors. \n \n7 Because Applicant\u2019s failure to be truthful regarding his drug use during his PSIs was not alleged in the \nSOR, I will only consider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole\u2013person \nfactors. \n \n8 Because Applicant\u2019s involvement with drugs prior to 2010 was not alleged in the SOR, I will only consider \nthis information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole\u2013person factors. \n\n \n \n5 \n \nApplicant submitted three employment-related awards and an October 2017 \ncertificate that he completed a drug and alcohol course. He also submitted two letters of \nrecommendation. There is no evidence as to whether Applicant disclosed his 2014 arrest \nand 2014 drug use to his facility security officer or company. (Item 1, Answer at 19, 20, \n22-25) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d9 As Commander in Chief, the \nPresident has the authority to \u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security \nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.\u201d10 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d11 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAdverse clearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d12 Thus, \na decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Security Executive Agent have established for \nissuing national security eligibility. \n \n                                                          \n \n9 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n10 Egan at 527. \n \n11 EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \n12 EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.13 \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than \na scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d14 The guidelines presume a nexus or rational \nconnection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an \napplicant\u2019s security suitability.15 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nalleged facts.16 An applicant has the burden of proving a potential mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.17 \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d18 \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d19 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern under Guideline E is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n                                                          \n13 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n14 See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n15 ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \n \n16 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n17 ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n18 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n19 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; See also AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \n \n7 \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nApplicant intentionally failed to disclose adverse criminal information and drug use \nin his February 2016 SCA. He was either ticketed or arrested eight times between 2000 \nand 2014. He used drugs on more than one occasion while holding a security clearance. \nHis history of misconduct, when considered as a whole, raises serious security concerns \nand demonstrates his questionable judgment, lack of candor, and unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(c) are established.20 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could mitigate the security concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstance that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressor, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nApplicant did not disclose two arrests, or his use of marijuana, while holding a \nclearance, in his February 2016 SCA. Additionally, he did not disclose the full extent of \nhis criminal history and drug use until he was confronted multiple times by investigators \nin 2017. Applicant did not demonstrate a prompt or good-faith effort to correct his \nomissions, concealment, or falsifications before he was confronted with the facts. There \nis insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG  \u00b6 17(a). \n \n                                                          \n20 Applicant denied the allegations alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j on the basis \nthat they should have been alleged under different guidelines. Based on the evidence, including the history \nand the pattern of Applicant\u2019s offenses, evaluating these security concerns under Guideline E is \nappropriate. \n\n \n \n8 \nApplicant asserted, in his February 2017 PSI, Answer, and supplemental Answer, \nthat he did not intentionally falsify his 2016 SCA. He claimed that he forgot about his \narrests and his drug use, even though the incidents occurred only two years before he \ncompleted his most recent SCA. Applicant was an educated and experienced \nprofessional when he completed the 2016 SCA. This was not his first security clearance \napplication, having completed one in 2010, and another prior to 2010. The evidence as a \nwhole reflects that he was aware of his arrest history and drug use when he completed \nhis most recent SCA. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent explanations for failing to disclose adverse \ninformation lack credibility, and do not alleviate concerns as to his trustworthiness, \njudgment, candor, integrity, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. His \nfailure to disclose requested information is serious, as is his pattern of misconduct over \nthe years. There is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG  \u00b6 17(c). \n \nApplicant attended an eight hour drug and alcohol educational class in October \n2017, shortly after the SOR was issued. This provides minimal mitigation, due to the \ntiming of the counseling and the fact that Applicant used drugs while holding a clearance, \nand when he was in his mid-thirties. The evidence does not establish persuasive \nmitigation under AG  \u00b6 17(d). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nApplicant is an educated and experienced professional, as evidenced by his letter \nof recommendation and performance awards. His lengthy history of questionable \njudgment, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and lack of candor when \ncompleting government forms and during government interviews, leaves me with doubt \nas to his ability to protect classified and sensitive information. He concealed derogatory \ninformation multiple times from the government, and his varied and inconsistent \nexplanations lack credibility. \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \nMany of the allegations are related to behavior that occurred when Applicant was \nyoung and immature. However, the criminal behavior continued until four or five years \nago, and Applicant made false statements to investigators as recently as two years ago. \nHis behavior established a lengthy pattern of rule violations, and a failure to cooperate or \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcerns at issue. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden to show that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of the United States to grant him national security \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. National \nsecurity eligibility is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nerney, Esq.   \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. An Iranian citizen by birth and a U.S. citizen since \n2008, Applicant met his burden to present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concern for foreign influence due to his minimal ties \nto Iran. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format) on November 3, 2015.1 This document is commonly known as \na security clearance application. After a background investigation, he was granted a \nsecurity clearance at the secret level, which his employer (via the Government \ncustomer) subsequently requested be upgraded to top secret.2 Thereafter, on March 6, \n1 Exhibit 1. \n2 Tr. 5. \n03/22/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, \nMaryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find \nthat it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access \nto classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual \nreasons for the action under the security guideline known as Guideline B for foreign \ninfluence due to his ties to Iran, the country of his birth.  \n \nWith assistance of counsel, Applicant answered the SOR on May 2, 2018. His \nanswers to the SOR allegations were mixed with explanations, and he provided \nsupporting documentation (marked as Exhibits A-N). He also requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.   \n \nThe case was assigned to me on September 24, 2018. The hearing took place \nas scheduled on December 4, 2018. Both Department Counsel and Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Government Exhibits 1-5 and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits A-W.3 I took administrative or official notice, which is similar to judicial notice, of \ncertain facts concerning the country of Iran per Department Counsel\u2019s written request.4 \nThe essential facts about Iran are discussed below. The hearing transcript was received \non December 12, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, a native of Iran, is a 36-year-old employee who is seeking to upgrade \nan existing security clearance to the top-secret level for his job as a senior systems \nengineer for a company in the defense industry. He has never married and has no \nchildren. He immigrated with his family to the United States in 2003. He, along with his \nfather, mother, and sister, became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2008,5 and they all reside \nin the United States.  \n \nShortly after his arrival here, Applicant attended a local community college and \nthen a large state university during 2004-2006, and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering. He was a graduate student at a private research university for \none semester in 2008 before he was admitted to a prestigious private research \nuniversity. He earned a master\u2019s degree in aeronautics and astronautics in June 2012. \nHe remained a student at the same university while on leave of absence from \nSeptember 2012 to August 2013.  \n \nApplicant has worked for his current employer since late 2014. Before that, he \nhad a series of part-time jobs. He was self-employed as a research associate during \n2012-2014. He was self-employed as information technology specialist during 2013-\n2014. He was employed as a research assistant for the university during 2010-2012 \n                                                          \n3 Tr. 12-18. \n \n4 Exhibit 5.  \n \n5 Exhibits I, J, K and L.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nwhile studying for his master\u2019s degree. Before that, he worked as an associate software \nengineer for a well-known research and development center during 2007-2008. This \nwas his first job after earning his bachelor\u2019s degree.   \n \nWith exception of an unnamed friend, the SOR concerns Applicant\u2019s family ties to \nIran via his father, mother, sister, aunt, and uncle, whom all have dual citizenship with \nthe United States and Iran. The relevant details are set forth below. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, age 63, a child psychologist with a master\u2019s degree from a \nU.S. university, was a kindergarten teacher or principal for a few years in Iran until the \nbirth of her second child. She has permanently resided in the United States since \nmoving here in 2003. She traveled to Iran periodically (e.g., once per year) to provide \ncare for her mother until her death after a long period of illness in 2011 or 2012. Since \nthe passing of her mother, Applicant\u2019s mother made three short trips to Iran to assist \nwith the shipping of household property to the United States.6 Applicant\u2019s mother is not \nemployed outside the home, and she has focused her time and energy throughout her \nmarriage on running the household and raising the children. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, age 69, has spent a career in academia, with teaching \npositions at the university level in both Iran and the United States. He earned his \ndegrees, including a Ph.D., from universities in the United States.7 He then worked for \nvarious companies in the United States. When they married, his wife was then a student \nat a U.S. university. After the revolution in Iran, Applicant\u2019s father and mother decided to \nreturn to Iran so she could be near her mother. They resided there from the early 1980s \n(Applicant was born in Iran in 1983) until they returned to the United States in 2003. In \nIran, Applicant\u2019s father worked as a professor of civil engineering at a technology \nuniversity and as a senior executive for the university. He never worked for the Iranian \ngovernment.8 He officially retired from the Iranian university in 2013 or 2014.9 Applicant \nunderstands his father is not entitled to receive a pension or other type of retirement \nbenefit. Applicant\u2019s father has worked for the last several years as a research professor \nfor the same state university where Applicant obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree. Before \nthat, he worked as an adjunct professor for the same university. Since retiring from the \nIranian university, Applicant\u2019s father has made two short trips to Iran in his capacity \nrepresenting the state university.10 Neither Applicant\u2019s father not mother intends to \nreturn to Iran.11  \n \n                                                          \n6 Exhibit N.  \n \n7 Tr. 89.  \n \n8 Exhibit N.  \n \n9 Exhibit N.  \n \n10 Exhibit N.  \n \n11 Exhibit N.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, age 32, recently earned a Ph.D. and she is now a research \nassistant in a post-doctoral program with the federal government.12 She traveled to Iran \non a single occasion in 2009 to visit her grandmother.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s aunt (his mother\u2019s sister) and uncle are dual citizens who reside in \nthe United States. They have a son born in Iran and a daughter born in the United \nStates. Both of Applicant\u2019s cousins are U.S. citizens. Applicant has limited contact with \nhis aunt and uncle due to geographic separation. He knows that his aunt has always \nbeen a stay-at-home mother, and his uncle has a Ph.D. in civil engineering. As far as \nApplicant knows, neither his aunt nor his uncle have any connections to the Iranian \ngovernment.  \n \nApplicant believes the unnamed friend, alleged in the SOR to be a citizen of Iran, \nis a person with whom he had irregular social interactions with but none since 2015.13 \nApplicant was introduced to the person by a professor they had in common. The social \ninteractions consisted of hanging out, watching football, and having a beer or two.14  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial interests are solely in the United States.15 His annual salary \nis about $100,000, and he has a net worth of about $250,000, which is sizeable given \nhis age and work history. He volunteers in various constructive community activities.16 \n \nBased on documentary evidence and the testimony of two character witnesses, \nApplicant has a good employment record and is held in high regard. For example, the \ntechnical director of the program in which Applicant works described Applicant as hard \nworking, exceptional, and a high performer in the company.17 He further described \nApplicant as dedicated, trustworthy, and straightforward in following the rules and \ndealing with security matters.18 Even more impressive was the highly favorable \nendorsement from Applicant\u2019s program director, a retired Air Force colonel with 25 \nyears of active duty, including multiple combat tours. He described Applicant as one of \nthe company\u2019s top engineers.19 He described Applicant\u2019s work ethic as the very \nhighest.20 He described Applicant\u2019s character as one of unquestioned integrity and \n                                                          \n12 Tr. 70-72.  \n \n13 Tr. 72-74.  \n \n14 To his credit, Department Counsel acknowledged that he could not identify a specific named person \nand further acknowledged that the allegation was \u201cfairly settled.\u201d Tr. 77.  \n \n15 Tr. 85-88; Exhibits C and D.  \n \n16 Exhibit B.  \n \n17 Tr. 22.  \n \n18 Tr. 23.  \n \n19 Tr. 37.  \n \n20 Tr. 37-38.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \ntrustworthiness with a tremendous sense of honesty.21 He has zero reservations in \nvouching for Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. He further \ndescribed Applicant as \u201cthe best young engineer\u201d employed by the company.22 Going \neven further in his praise, he described Applicant as a national resource, among the \nbrightest of his generation, and whose contributions to the defense and security of the \nUnited States are essential.\u201d23 \n \nConcerning the country of Iran, the February 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, then a \nkey U.S. ally, opened a long rift in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United \nStates that continues to today. On November 4, 1979, radical Iranian students seized \nthe U.S. Embassy in Tehran, and then held hostages until shortly after President \nReagan\u2019s inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States severed relations with \nIran on April 7, 1980. As a result, in the United States the Iranian Interests Section is \nlocated in the Embassy of Pakistan, and the U.S. protecting power in Iran is \nSwitzerland. The U.S. Government has a number of special concerns regarding Iranian \nbehavior as outlined in Department Counsel\u2019s written request.24 The concerns include \nIran\u2019s efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction; its support for violent opposition \nto the Middle East peace process; its ongoing support of the Assad regime in war-torn \nSyria; and its dismal human-rights record. The United States has designated Iran as a \nstate sponsor of terrorism for many years.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.25 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.26 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d27 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \n                                                          \n21 Tr. 38.  \n \n22 Tr. 43.  \n \n23 Tr. 46-48; Exhibit A at 3.  \n \n24 Exhibit 5.  \n \n25 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n26 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n27 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n \n6 \n \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.28 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.29 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.30 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.31 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.32 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.33 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.34 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.35 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nThe gravamen of the SOR under Guideline B for foreign influence is whether \nApplicant\u2019s ties to Iran should disqualify him from access to classified information. \nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence,36 the suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern \nunder the guideline is: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \n                                                          \n28 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n29 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n \n30 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n31 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n32 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.37 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology.  \n \n \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of Iran. Suffice it to say, the U.S. \nGovernment views the behavior of the Iranian government as presenting a serious \nnational security concern. Given Applicant\u2019s ties to Iran, a country that is hostile to the \nUnited States, the Government has established its case under Guideline B. In practice, \nthe Iranian government considers dual citizens as Iranian citizens only, and the fact that \nApplicant and his family members obtained U.S. citizenship does not amount to a formal \nor legal renunciation of Iranian citizenship, which is at the discretion of Iranian \ngovernment. Nonetheless, I have given no weight to the evidence concerning the \nunnamed friend in the SOR. At best, the interaction was a casual, social relationship \nthat ended several years ago. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by the \nevidence.  \n \n \nThe guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign \ninfluence concerns. Given the evidence here, I considered the following mitigating \nconditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n                                                          \n37 AG \u00b6 6.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest.  \n \n \nIran\u2019s hostility to the United States and the heightened risk it presents place a \nheavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With that said, Applicant \nhas multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. He was \narticulate, serious, candid, and credible at the hearing. He cooperated fully and provided \ntruthful information about his ties to Iran during the security clearance process. He \nmade a highly favorable impression upon me during the hearing.  \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iran, which can now be \ndescribed as minimal. Applicant, then age 20, and his family came to the United States \nin 2003, and he has since established and made his life here. His parents have a long-\nstanding connection to the United States, both having spent years here obtaining their \nacademic degrees before returning to Iran in the early 1980s. Now, Applicant\u2019s father, \nmother, sister, uncle, aunt, and cousins are citizens of and residents in the United \nStates. Applicant has spent the last 16 years living, furthering his education, and \nworking in the United States. His financial interests are solely in the United States. He is \nheld in high regard by many who know him. Indeed, the character evidence, both \ndocumentary and testimonial, was quite powerful.  \n \n \nIt is unclear what has changed since Applicant was favorably adjudicated for a \nsecurity clearance at the secret level within the last few years.38 Nonetheless, Applicant \nhas had more time to establish his ties and connections to the United States and to \ndemonstrate that he adheres to security rules and requirements for his employment with \na defense contractor. Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is \nunlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests \nof the United States and the interests of the Iranian government, a terrorist organization, \nor his family members who have Iranian citizenship. I further conclude there is no \nconflict of interest, because Applicant has developed such deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States that he can be expected to resolve any \npotential conflict of interest in the favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially \napplicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighted the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is \n                                                          \n38 To his credit, Department Counsel acknowledged in closing argument that he could not honestly say \nwhat had changed since the favorable adjudication.

Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective June 8, 2017. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOD adjudicators \ncould not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. It recommended \nthat his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether his \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nOn January 22, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting all of the \nallegations, and requested a hearing.

(HE II at 1) Control of the West Bank is divided, \nper a 1994 agreement, between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. (HE II at 1) In \n2007, Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror organization, violently took over the Gaza Strip, \npart of the territory of the West Bank that the Palestinian Authority had governed.  \n \nThe U.S. State Department advises against travel to the West Bank because of \nthe risk of terrorism, civil unrest, and the potential for armed conflict. (Item III at 1) \nMultiple terrorist groups are present in the West Bank. (HE IV at 2) The Palestinian \nauthority continues to provide \u201cmartyr payments\u201d to the families of Palestinian \nindividuals killed carrying out terrorist acts. (HE V at 3) \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n \nThe West Bank has a significant problem with terrorism. The potential for civil \nunrest is pervasive. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s contacts with relatives who live there \ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b).  \n \n \nApplicant has been living in the United States for more than 25 years. In that \ntime, he has earned a Ph.D, started a family, and saved more than $1 million. He is a \npillar of his community, and a highly-respected scientist. Given the financial, familial, \ncommunity, and professional roots that he has cultivated during the 27 years he has \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \nlived in the United States, I conclude that he would resolve any conflict, generated by \nhis relatives residing in the West Bank, in the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no \nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is so minimal, or the \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates, that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest,\u201d applies. Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security \nconcern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nIn reaching this decision, I was particularly cognizant of Applicant\u2019s stellar \nemployment and character references. \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

Berry, Esquire \n05/01/2019 \nDecision \n \nKATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant has mitigated the concerns related to foreign influence raised by his family \nmembers who are citizens and residents of Egypt and his Egyptian property interests. His \nrequest for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of Case \n \nOn March 10, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-86). On \nOctober 30, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence. The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on \ninformation available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. Applicant answered the SOR on November 22, 2017, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June \n12, 2018. \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nJuly 13, 2018, scheduling the hearing for August 13, 2018. The hearing was convened as \n\n2 \n \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough R, which were admitted without objection. Applicant also called three character \nwitnesses. The record was left open until September 7, 2018, and Applicant timely \nsubmitted AE S, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on August 20, 2018. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nThe Government and Applicant both requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Egypt encapsulated in GE 3 and AE R. Those documents provide \nelaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included \nin the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, and not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 49 years old, married (since1997), and has two children, a daughter age \n20 (who attends an American university) and a son age 16 (who is in high school). Applicant \nwas born Egypt and took his bachelor\u2019s degree in Civil Engineering in 1991 from an Egyptian \nuniversity. He arrived in the United States in 2009 and promptly obtained a green card \n(Permanent U. S. Resident). He was naturalized in 2015. Because his children were minors \nliving with him when Applicant was naturalized, they are now U.S. citizens. Applicant took \na Master\u2019s in Business Administration from a U. S. university in 2016. From May 2012 until \nJuly 2016, he worked for a defense contractor. In July 2016, Applicant formed his own \ncompany and is now self-employed. He specializes in construction and project \nmanagement. He continues to do work for his former employer. Applicant has worked on \nfederal government projects, including embassy construction, since 1995. While working for \nhis former employer, Applicant surrendered his Egyptian passport in 2015 or 2016. When \nhe travels, he uses only his U. S. passport.1  \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has family members who are citizens and residents \nof Egypt and that Applicant has property interests in Egypt. More specifically, as to family \nmembers, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s: (1) mother is a citizen and resident of Egypt \nand a retired pharmacist for the department of health; (2) two sisters are citizens and \nresidents of Egypt and that one is a teacher at a technological academy and the other is a \ndiplomat for the Egyptian government; (3) mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Egypt \nand a retired pharmacist for the Ministry of Health ; (4) sister-in-law and brother-in-law are \nphysicians, the former employed by the department of health and the latter retired from the \ndepartment of health.2 Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations, upon which \nhe elaborated at the hearing.3 \n                                                          \n1 GE 1; Tr.15-21, 58-59.  \n  \n2 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-g.  \n  \n3 Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-g. \n \n\n3 \n \n  \nAs to property interests in Egypt, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) owns two \napartments; (2) co-owns a home with his mother and two sisters; (3) has bank accounts \nand bank certificates of varying values; (3) has two bank accounts maintained by his \nspouse.4 Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations, upon which he elaborated \nat the hearing.5 \n \nApplicant stated in his Answer that when he became a permanent resident in 2009, \nhis long-time goal and passion was to become a U. S. citizen along with his wife and children \nand to serve this nation with honor and dignity. He reiterated those sentiments in his hearing \ntestimony. Applicant wanted his children to live in the United States and be educated here. \nWhen he became a U. S. citizen, he pledged complete, undivided, and unconditional \nallegiance to this country. Applicant could never be manipulated, coerced, or induced to do \nanything that would be against the interests of the United States.6 \n \nIn all of Applicant\u2019s years working on federal government projects (since 1995), he \nhas never had any security violations or any disciplinary issues. If he learned that one or \nmore of his family members in Egypt were being exploited to compromise our national \nsecurity through him, Applicant would report it his Facility Security Officer (FSO) and other \nappropriate authorities. He has been briefed on the appropriate reporting requirements in \nsuch a situation.7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s character witnesses vouched for his exemplary character. The witnesses \neach had personal knowledge of Applicant. They had known him from as far back as 2006, \n2009, and 2012. They each knew the security concerns that prompted this hearing. \nApplicant was described as \u201chonest\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d \u201creliable\u201d with \u201cgreat integrity.\u201d Those \npositive qualities were also expressed in the character letters submitted by Applicant. 8 \n \nApplicant testified about his family members in Egypt. His mother retired as a \npharmacist about 15 or 16 years ago. She is 87. Applicant does not provide any financial \nsupport to his mother. She has no ties to the Egyptian government and was not required to \njoin any political party to work in the department of health. Applicant visits her about once a \nyear. His mother knows nothing about him seeking a security clearance. She only knows \nthat Applicant does construction engineering but not exactly what his job entails. She only \n                                                          \n4 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l-p.  \n \n5 Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.l-p. The SOR also alleged that Applicant\u2019s spouse owned a vehicle in Egypt. SOR \u00b6 1.k. \nApplicant answered that this vehicle was sold in October 2017, which he confirmed in his testimony.

The Academy is a private school. Applicant\u2019s sister \nhas no ties to the Egyptian government or the military.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s other sister has an administrative position with the Egyptian consulate in \nBahrain. It is not a political appointment but is a civil service position. His sisters know \nnothing about him seeking a security clearance. They only know that Applicant does \nconstruction engineering but not exactly what his job entails. They only know that at some \npoint Applicant was working on an embassy project. He speaks to them about every two to \nfour weeks. Applicant sees them when he visits his mother about once every year.10 \n \nApplicant sees his mother-in-law about once a year, when he visits his mother. His \nmother-in-law has no ties to the Egyptian government or military. She does not know about \nApplicant seeking a security clearance and does not know about his work for the United \nStates government. He speaks to her about every two to three weeks. Applicant has never \ngiven his mother-in-law any financial support.11  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a physician with the Ministry of Health. She specializes in \ninfection control. Her spouse is a retired physician from the Ministry of Health. He has been \nretired for about seven to eight years. Applicant visits his sister-in-law when he visits his \nmother. Other than that he speaks with his sister-in-law about once a month or less. \nApplicant speaks only infrequently to her spouse. Applicant has never provided financial \nsupport to his sister-in-law or her spouse. She and her spouse have no ties to the \ngovernment or the military. They do not know about Applicant\u2019s application for a security \nclearance or the work he does for the United States government.12 \n \nApplicant testified about his real property and financial holdings in Egypt. He owns \ntwo apartments. The first apartment (Apt. 1) was alleged to be worth about $70,000.13 That \nis not currently an accurate evaluation of Apt. 1. Applicant sold that property in July of this \n                                                          \n9 Tr. 22-23, 61-62. \n \n10 Tr. 24-27, 63-65. When forward-deployed, the U. S.

He has distant relatives in Egypt, but he does not have regular \ncontacts with them. Tr. 72, 84-85. Only Applicant\u2019s wife and two children know that he has applied for a security \nclearance.

The sale price was $49,000.14 \n \nThe second apartment (Apt. 2) was alleged to be worth about $125,000.15 That is not \ncurrently an accurate evaluation of Apt. 2. Because of the economic situation in Egypt and \nthe depreciation of the Egyptian pound, Applicant estimated that its current value is between \n$60,000 and $70,000. Apt. 2 was a gift from his father (now deceased). Egyptian custom is \nthat the father gives his son the gift of an apartment (if he can afford it). In any event, \nApplicant has not tried to sell Apt. 2, because he wants to keep it as a place to stay when \nhe and his family visit.16 \n \nAlong with his mother and his two sisters, Applicant is a co-owner of a home that was \nalleged to be worth approximately $15,000.17 That is not currently an accurate evaluation. \nBecause of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound and that the home\u2019s roof has collapsed, \nit is now worth about $8,000. Of that value, Applicant\u2019s mother would take the first one-\neighth, Applicant would take half of the remainder, with his sisters sharing the other half of \nthe remainder. That works out to be about $3,500 going to Applicant.18 \n \nApplicant testified about his two bank accounts alleged to have a value of about \n$40,000.19 Applicant testified that he closed those two accounts, one in 2016 and the other \nin 2017.20 \n \nApplicant testified about his bank certificates and savings bonds alleged to be worth \nabout $16,000.21 The value of those instruments have depreciated to less than half that \namount because of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound. They are now worth about \n$6,000. Those instruments are in Egyptian pounds, which makes it very hard to convert to \nU. S. dollars. When economic conditions improve, Applicant intends to close those \naccounts.22 \n \n                                                          \n14 Tr. 29-30, 72-73; AE S.  \n   \n15 SOR \u00b6 1.i.  \n \n16 Tr. 30, 78-79.

Again, because of the \ndepreciation of the Egyptian pound, those certificates are now worth about $7,000 or \n$8,000. Those certificates are in the name of his children.24 \n \nApplicant testified about the two bank accounts his wife maintains in Egypt, one \nalleged to have a value of about $14,000 and the second with a value of about $50,000.25 \nHis wife closed the first account in July of this year. The second account has been devalued \ndue to the depreciation of the Egyptian pound. It is now worth about $23,000 to $27,000.26 \n \nBy my calculation, Applicant\u2019s Egyptian assets alleged in SOR totaled $354,000. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s testimony, either by closing some of those accounts or by virtue of \ncurrency devaluation (or a combination of both), his current Egyptian assets total between \n$149,000 and $163,500.27 Of that amount, $7,000 to $8,000 are gifts (bank certificates) \nfrom his mother-in-law to his two children, which are held in their names, not Applicant\u2019s \nname.28 \n \nApplicant\u2019s average salary is between $180,000 and $190,000 annually, although \nthis year his business has picked up and he might make between $250,000 and $300,000.29 \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a civil engineer for a defense contractor, and she makes between \n$140,000 and $150,000 a year including a bonus.30 Applicant has a 401k plan with about \n$37,000 to $38,000 in it.31 He and his wife own their home, which is valued between \n$530,000 and $540,000. They are buying a new home, closing at the end of August this \nyear. It is valued at $950,000.32 Applicant\u2019s combined bank accounts (business and \npersonal) total between $512,000 and $519,000.33 He estimated that his U.S. assets total \n                                                          \n23 SOR \u00b6 1.n. \n \n24 Tr. 34-35.  \n \n25 SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.o and p. \n \n26 Tr. 35-36.  \n \n27 I did not include Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s vehicle, which was sold in 2017.  \n \n28 Applicant has no other assets in Egypt.

If Applicant lost all of his Egyptian assets, he testified credibly that it \nwould not have any impact on him financially.34  \n \nEgypt  \n \nEgypt is a geopolitical partner of the United States, and those two countries have \nhad strong economic and security relationships since 1979. They have worked in tandem \nto combat global terrorism and violent extremism. In 2015, Egypt and the United States \nheld a Strategic Dialogue to strengthen the security cooperation between them.     \n \nThe United States Department of State warns U.S. citizens of threats from terrorist \ngroups in Egypt and to consider the risks of travel to the country. U.S. citizens have been \nkidnapped and murdered by terrorist and extremist groups. Several terrorist groups, \nincluding ISIS, have committed multiple deadly attacks in Egypt, targeting government \nofficials, security forces, public venues, tourist sites, civil aviation and other modes of \npublic transportation, along with diplomatic facilities. U.S. citizens remain at risk as ISIS \nuses kidnapping for ransom to finance their operations. Due to security concerns, U.S. \ndiplomatic personnel are prohibited from travel to parts of Egypt and U.S. citizens are \nwarned to avoid those areas. \n \nExtremist organizations operate in Egypt and ISIS has called on supporters to \nattack U.S. citizens and coalition partners. ISIS media has threatened that places \nassociated with Westerners, Christians, the Egyptian military and police, and Egyptian \ngovernment facilities could be struck at any time. Authorities believe there is continued \nlikelihood of such potential attacks. These terrorist groups use conventional and \nnonconventional weapons to target U.S. Government interests and private interests. \n \nEgypt\u2019s human rights problems involve the excessive use of force by security \nforces, including unlawful killings and torture; and deficiencies in due process, including \nexcessive use of preventive custody and pretrial detention, use of military courts to try \ncivilians, trials of hundreds of defendants in which authorities did not present evidence on \nan individual basis, suppression of civil liberties, including societal and government \nrestrictions on freedom of expression, the press, and peaceful assemble and association. \nThere are also problems with arbitrary arrests; a politically motivated judiciary; restrictions \non academic freedom; impunity for security forces; limits on religious freedom; and \nviolence, harassment, and societal discrimination against women and girls.35 \n \n      \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n                                                          \n34 Tr. 41-43.  \n \n35 AE R; GE 3.  \n\n8 \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded \non mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern under the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \u00b6 \n6: \n \n\n9 \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if \nthey create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \n     \nApplicant has connections to his mother, his two sisters, and his in-laws, who are all \ncitizens and residents of Egypt. There is an articulated heightened risk associated with \nhaving ties to family members in Egypt, due to the activities of terrorist organizations and \ninsurgents operating within its borders. In addition, Applicant had over $350,000 in assets \nin Egypt, between real estate and bank accounts, when the SOR was issued. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located , or the positions or activities of those persons \nin that are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position \n\n10 \n \nof having to  choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S. interest; and \n \n(f)  the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property                                  \nis such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nI will address Applicant\u2019s Egyptian assets first. When the SOR was issued, Applicant \nhad over $350,000 of assets in Egypt. That was sufficient to raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 7(f). Since that time and before the hearing, Applicant liquidated all but approximately \n$163,000 or more. The principal asset remaining is an apartment that was a gift from his \nlate father when Applicant reached manhood (worth about $125,000 today). He intends to \nkeep that to use when he and his family visit their Egyptian relatives. He intends to liquidate \nthe remaining assets when he is able to do so with the banks in question. Those remaining \nEgyptian assets constitute less than 1% of Applicant\u2019s U. S. assets. AG \u00b6 8(f) applies to \nmitigate any security concern.36 \n \nApplicant\u2019s closest connection is, understandably, with his mother, who is 87 years \nold. He communicates with her about weekly and visits her about once per year.37 She does \nnot know that Applicant is applying for a security clearance or that he does work for the \nUnited States government. She does not know specifically what Applicant does for a living, \nonly that he is an engineer. \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his two sisters are far less frequent than those with his \nmother. He speaks with his sisters about every two to three weeks. The same is true with \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law. He speaks with his sister-in-law less frequently, about once per \nmonth. He speaks with her spouse infrequently. Other than Applicant\u2019s sister who works in \nan administrative position with the Egyptian consulate in Bahrain, none these relatives have \nany ties to the government or military. Nor do any of these relatives (including the sister \nworking for the consulate) know that Applicant is seeking a security clearance or the details \nof what his job entails. Applicant has been very assiduous in not providing any details about \nhis work to his Egyptian relatives. I do not find the frequency of Applicant\u2019s contacts with \nhis Egyptian family members sufficient to raise security concerns. They are reasonable \n                                                          \n36 This case is unlike a financial considerations case, where post-SOR remedial efforts are often a sign of bad \nfaith. In fact, Applicant\u2019s efforts to liquidate his Egyptian assets shows prudence and his appreciation of the \nsecurity concerns that ownership of such assets might create.  \n \n37 When Applicant visits his mother, he often also sees his sisters, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law. \n  \n\n11 \n \nmeans to keep in contact with family members who live in a foreign country that is an ally \nof the United States.38 \nThose same contacts, however, need to be evaluated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b). \nApplicant arrived in the United States in 2009 and was granted permanent residency that \nsame year. He applied for citizenship, and it was granted in 2015 (very soon after the \nrequired residency in the U. S.). By that time, Applicant had been working on numerous \nfederal government projects since 1995. He testified credibly that his long-time goal was to \nbecome an American citizen and raise his children here and educate them. Applicant\u2019s \ndream came true in that his daughter is attending a prestigious American university, and \nhis son is in high school here. Applicant and his wife are in the process of buying their \nsecond home and selling the current home. Their first home is currently valued at over \n$500,000. Their new home is valued at $950,000. As noted above, Applicant estimated that \nhis U. S. assets total about $1.7 million. He was described as \u201chonest,\u2019 \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d and \nwith \u201cgreat integrity.\u201d Finally, Applicant testified credibly that if he learned that one or more \nof his Egyptian family members were being exploited to compromise national security \nthrough him, he would report it to his FSO and other appropriate authorities. Applicant has \nestablished himself as a solid United States citizen. I find that it is unlikely that he will be \nplaced in a position to choose between his Egyptian family members and the interests of \nthe United States. In addition, I find that Applicant has such a deep loyalty to the United \nStates that he would resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply.  \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed \nthe evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.39 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to \nshow that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \n           For Applicant \n \n                                                          \n38 I find nothing troublesome about Applicant\u2019s sister who works in an administrative position at the Egyptian \nconsulate in Bahrain. Bahrain is a nation friendly to the U. S. and hosts the U. S. Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet.  \n \n39 AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  \n \n\n12 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. National security eligibility is granted. \n \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Edmunds, Esq.  \n \n07/30/2019 \n____________ \nDecision \n \n______________ \n \n \n \n \nKATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised by her \ncontacts to Iraq and by her prior employment as an administrative assistant at a Saudi \nArabian cultural mission in the United States. Accordingly, this case is decided for \nApplicant.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86 format) on September 23, 2016. This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. On December 18, 2017, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), \nexplaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to \n\n2 \n \ngrant her eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for \nthe action under the security guidelines known as Guideline B for foreign influence and \nGuideline C for foreign preference. Applicant answered the SOR on February 15, 2018, \nand requested a hearing.    \n \nThe case was assigned to me on July 20, 2018. After consulting with Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel, a hearing was scheduled for September 7, 2018. The hearing proceeded as \nscheduled. The Government submitted four exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 and one Hearing \nExhibit (HE 1), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \n15 exhibits (AE) A through O, which were admitted without objection. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, and without objection, I left the record open until September 17, 2018, to allow \nApplicant to submit additional exhibits. Applicant timely submitted AE P through R, which \nwere admitted without objection. I received the transcript (Tr.) on September 14, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and Iraqi-born. She arrived in the United States in \nSeptember 2007 and was naturalized in August 2013. Applicant earned her associate\u2019s \ndegree in Iraq. Applicant was married in 2009 (to a U. S. citizen), had her son in 2010, \nand was divorced in June 2016. Except for the period from April 2014 to December 2016, \nApplicant has worked for defense contractors since May 2003. She continues to be \nemployed by a defense contractor, but she has recently enlisted in the U. S. Navy. (GE \n1; GE 2; AE A; AE P; Tr. 83-84.)    \n \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged that: (1) Applicant\u2019s parents, two brothers, \nand her youngest sister are citizens and residents of Iraq; (2) two of Applicant\u2019s other \nsisters are citizens and residents of Iraq, worked as linguists for U. S. or coalition forces \nin Iraq, and in 2009 they were deemed by U. S. intelligence to be security risks to U. S. \nor coalition forces. Under Guideline C, the SOR alleged that as of April 2014, Applicant \nwas employed by the Cultural Mission of Saudi Arabia. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. and 2.)  \n \nApplicant identified the immediate family members who were subjects of the SOR \nin her April 2015 security clearance application and in her September 2016 security \nclearance application. The frequency of Applicant\u2019s telephone calls with those family \nmembers in 2015 and in 2016 was about the same. Except for one brother employed as \na medical technician by the Iraqi government, those family members have no ties to the \nIraqi government or military. (GE 1, pp. 32-43; GE 2, pp. 24-35.) \n \nApplicant admitted that her mother, her two brothers, and a sister are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq; she also answered that her father was a citizen and resident of Iraq but \nthat he died in October 2017. She admitted that two of her other sisters were citizens and \n                                                          \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. \n \n\n3 \n \nresidents of Iraq and had been linguists, but she denied with explanations that those two \nsisters assisted any anti-coalition forces in Iraq. Applicant answered that in April 2014 she \nwas employed as an administrative assistant with the Cultural Mission of Saudi Arabia \nlocated in the United States, but that employment ended in December 2016. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 \n1. and 2.) \n \nApplicant testified about her service as a linguist for U. S. troops in Iraq. She \nstarted working as a linguist in Iraq at about 18 or 19 years of age. Applicant is fluent in \nArabic and English. Because of force-protection requirements, Applicant had to live and \nwork on base with U.S. troops. She could not leave the base, and her relatives could not \nvisit her on base. She was not allowed to speak with her relatives while working as a \nlinguist. Thus, from 2003 to 2007, she had little contact with her relatives while working \nas a liguist. Although the durations of deployments varied, on average one deployment \nwas about 9 to 11 months straight. She left Iraq after having worked as linguist for U.S. \ntroops in Iraq from 2003 to 2007. Applicant came to the United States on a special \nimmigrant visa and was fast-tracked to naturalization due to her service as a linguist for \nU. S. troops. Applicant\u2019s resume details her six deployments to Iraq as a linguist from May \n2003 to present. Those six deployments add up to more than six years spent in Iraq in \nthe service of U. S. troops and coalition forces. From March 2012 to April 2014, Applicant \nworked for a defense contractor state-side training over 4,000 DOD and Department of \nState employees in Iraqi and Middle Eastern culture. (Tr. 17-20, 42, 75-78; AE A.) She \nwas on deployment to Iraq when she received the SOR and returned to the U.S. to \nprepare for this hearing. (Tr. 43-44.) Since Applicant\u2019s arrival in the United States in \nSeptember 2007, she has maintained her residences in the United States. (GE 1, pp. 12-\n15; GE 2, pp. 9-11.) \n \nApplicant testified about her contacts with her immediate family members. She   \nsaw her siblings that are the subject of the SOR, when Applicant left Iraq in 2007 and \nmore recently in 2008 or 2009. The last time Applicant saw her mother was in 2010 or \n2011, when Applicant and her then husband met her mother in Turkey, so that her mother \ncould meet Applicant\u2019s then new-born son. Before that meeting, Applicant saw her mother \nin 2007 and in 2008 or 2009. (GE 2, p. 42; Tr. 58-59, 78-79.) \n \nWhen Applicant completed her most recent security clearance application \n(September 2016), she was telephoning her mother and her oldest sister daily or every \ntwo or three days. Applicant spoke with her oldest brother and her younger sister about \nmonthly and her youngest brother annually. Applicant\u2019s calls to her mother and siblings \nbecame much less frequent. There are two reasons for that. First, Applicant and her \nmother had a falling out. Applicant believed that her mother delayed an unseemly length \nof time before notifying her that her father had passed away. Applicant missed her father\u2019s \nfuneral. It angered Applicant, and she decided to stop talking to her mother. She has not \nspoken to her mother since her father\u2019s death in October 2017. Second, in December \n2017, she received the SOR and interpreted it to mean that the U. S. Government did not \nwant her to talk to the family members identified in the SOR. Applicant did not want to \njeopardize her job, which she loves, and her life in the United States, which she loves and \nconsiders this country to be her home.  So, she decided to stop communications with her \n\n4 \n \nimmediate family. She has no problem with that. Applicant did not tell her family why she \nstopped communicating with them. Nor did she tell any family members that she was \nseeking a security clearance, and they do not know what she does for a living. (GE 1; Tr. \n24-25, 28-30, 37-38, 51-55, 60-62, 65-67.) \nApplicant testified about her oldest sister and her immediate younger sister who \nthe SOR alleged were deemed by an Army intelligence command in May 2009 to be \nsecurity risks. (GE 3 supports those allegations.) Applicant had no idea about those \nallegations. She hopes they are not true. The first Applicant ever heard of such allegations \nwas when she received the SOR. She was only told by family that one or both of those \nsisters were laid off. (Tr. 30-32, 63-64.) GE 4 reports on an October 27, 2016 \ncounterintelligence screening of Applicant that confirmed that those individuals were her \nsisters. Applicant had disclosed that fact in her \u201cRelatives and Associates\u201d form. As noted, \nApplicant also disclosed that fact in her 2015 and 2016 security clearance applications. \nThe frequency of telephone contacts Applicant had with those two sisters were \napproximately the same in 2015 and 2016. (GE 1, pp. 32-43; GE 2, pp. 24-35.) \n  \n The family member alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is Applicant\u2019s youngest sister. Applicant \nhas not seen her since about 2007. She is about 19 years old and is either a student in \nhigh school or in the first year of college. Applicant and this sister do not talk at all. (Tr. \n32-34.) Applicant explained that when filling out her security clearance applications she \nhad to call her mother, because Applicant did not have first-hand knowledge of her family \nmembers\u2019 ages, marital status, and whether there were any nieces or nephews. (Tr. 80-\n81.) \n \nApplicant testified about her employment by the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission \nfrom April 2014 to December 2016. She was an administrative assistant providing general \nadministrative and clerical support. Applicant said that the Cultural Mission and the Saudi \nArabian Embassy have different missions and have different locations in the United \nStates. Unlike the traditional embassy mission, the Cultural Mission provides assistance \nto Saudi Arabian students who are coming on a scholarship to study in the United States \nfor two years and then return home. Applicant left that job to take her current job with a \ndefense contractor. (Tr. 35-37; AE A.)  \n \nApplicant testified that she has no financial interests, real estate, or bank accounts \nin Iraq. Her mother does not own any land in Iraq. Applicant has no retirement accounts \nin Saudi Arabia. Applicant is not a member of any foreign groups or associations. \nApplicant rents her home here. She has checking and savings accounts in the U.S. \nApplicant also has 401(k) accounts with two former employers here. (Tr. 36-37, 42-47; \nAE M.) She submitted an affidavit stating her willingness to renounce any dual citizenship \nshe may be deemed to have with any foreign country. (AE E.) \n \nApplicant testified about her son, who is nine. He loves baseball and is on a team. \nEven if Applicant does not have her son on a weekend when he has a game, she attends \nanyway to show support. Also, Applicant is teaching him soccer. She has a good working \nrelationship with her ex-spouse about caring for their son. When Applicant is deployed, \nher ex-spouse cares for their son. When Applicant returns, they have joint custody and \n\n5 \n \nshare care-taking responsibilities. Applicant participates in the parent teacher association \nat her son\u2019s school. (Tr. 41-42, 46, 81-83; AE G, I, K, and R.) \n \nApplicant submitted a number of letters of recommendation. Each of the authors \nhad first-hand knowledge of Applicant\u2019s performance in the field as a linguist and cultural \nadvisor. One author is Applicant\u2019s current site manager where Applicant is posted in Iraq. \nHe described her as \u201creliable and trustworthy\u201d with \u201cexcellent and unmatched work ethic\u201d \nwho \u201cperforms her job flawlessly.\u201d Another unit leader who has known Applicant as a \nlinguist in Iraq since October 2017 called her \u201cprofessional and trustworthy.\u201d \n \nAnother one of Applicant\u2019s Iraq site managers wrote that he has worked with over \n300 linguists during his Army career and as a defense contractor in Iraq and that Applicant \nis the \u201cmost loyal, honest, and trustworthy\u201d one that he\u2019s ever worked with. He gave one \nexample. Once in the middle of the night an emergency arose that needed a linguist \nimmediately. He called Applicant who without a question jumped out of bed, handled the \nmission, which took about two hours, and still showed up the next morning to perform her \ndaily duties. (AE B.) \n \nAn officer-in-charge of a unit wrote that Applicant\u2019s \u201cduties have covered a vast \nnumber military subjects and cultural advisory roles.\u201d She \u201chas consistently exceeded \nexpectations.\u201d A Senior Counterintelligence Support Specialist wrote that Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cprofessionalism/expertise is in the top 10% of all the linguists I have worked with in the \nlast 12 years of being in the intelligence field.\u201d (AE J.)  \n \nA Marine Colonel commanding officer of a task force penned a handwritten note \non a Certificate of Appreciation awarded to Applicant for a job well-done as a Linguist, \nTranslator, and Cultural Advisor from March 2017 to August 2017: \u201cThank you for all of \nyour hard work for the S-4 [Logistics], but especially with medical. Your linguistic skills \nare exceptional and we will miss you.\u201d (AE N.)  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts concerning Iraq as requested by \nthe Government: Iraq faces many challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. \nNumerous terrorist groups and elements hostile to the United States remain active in Iraq. \nIraqi forces, with the assistance of the United States, have seen successes recently and \nmost of the territory previously held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL) has been \nretaken. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high, and the Department of State warns \nU.S. citizens that all but essential travel to Iraq should be avoided. Although the \ngovernment of lraq has made significant progress in its campaign to retake occupied \nterritory from ISIL, there remains a security vacuum in parts of Iraq.  \n \nThe State Department warns that anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten \nU.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and attacks by means \nof improvised explosive devices occur frequently in many areas of the country, including \nBaghdad. Methods of attack have included explosively formed penetrators, magnetic \nIEDs placed on vehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed on or concealed \n\n6 \n \nnear roads, mortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire weapons. Such \nattacks often take place in public venues such as cafes and markets. \nThe U.S. government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. \ngovernment personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under \nstrict security guidelines. All U.S. Government employees under the authority of the U.S. \nChief of Mission must follow strict safety and security procedures when traveling outside \nthe Embassy and Consulates.  \nIn its annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported that ISIL \ncommitted the overwhelming number of serious human rights abuses, including attacks \nagainst civilians, especially Shia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL, members of other \nreligious and ethnic minorities, women, and children. ISIL members committed acts of \nviolence on a mass scale, including killing by suicide bombings, improvised explosive \ndevices, execution-style shootings, public beheadings, and other forms of executions. \nSectarian hostility, widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of \ngovernment and society weakened the Iraqi government's authority and worsened \neffective human rights protections. (HE 1.) \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance. \nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, \n994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a security clearance).  \n \n As noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly \nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they \nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 U.S. at 531. Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and \nthe Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information. Directive, \n\u00b6 3.2. An unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any \nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level. \nDirective, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). The \nGovernment has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR \nthat have been controverted. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n  \nAn applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven. In addition, an applicant has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. Directive, \nEnclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is \n\n7 \n \nless than a preponderance of evidence. 484 U.S. at 531. The Appeal Board has followed \nthe Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-\nevidence standard. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n  \n \n \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence  \nThe foreign influence security concern is explained at AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAn individual is not automatically disqualified from holding a security clearance \nbecause they have connections and contacts in a foreign country. Instead, in assessing \nan individual\u2019s potential vulnerability to foreign influence, an administrative judge must \ntake into account the foreign government involved; the intelligence-gathering history of \nthat government; the country\u2019s human-rights record; and other pertinent factors. ISCR \nCase No. 05-03250 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007) (setting forth factors an administrative \njudge must consider in foreign influence cases).  \n \n \nThe United States and Iraq are allies in the war against ISIL and other terrorists \nand insurgents. The serious security threat posed by these terrorists and other elements \nhostile to the United States must be taken into account in assessing the security concerns \nraised by Applicant\u2019s family members in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s relationship to her foreign \nrelatives, coupled with the facts administratively noticed, raise a heightened security \nconcern.  \n \n \nIn assessing the security concern raised by Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and \ninterests, I have considered the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7 and \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8:   \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n\n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nAn individual with family members and other connections in a foreign country faces \na high, but not insurmountable, hurdle in mitigating security concerns raised by such \nforeign ties. An applicant is not required, however, \u201cto sever all ties with a foreign country \nbefore he or she can be granted access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-\n13739 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2008). What factor or combination of factors will mitigate \nsecurity concerns raised by an applicant with family members in a foreign country is not \neasily identifiable or quantifiable. ISCR Case No. 11-12202 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2014). \n \nIn the present case, Applicant\u2019s mother, three sisters, and two brothers are \nadmittedly citizens and residents of Iraq. Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to \na SOR require no further proof by the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions [applicant] made to the SOR allegations . . . relieve \nDepartment Counsel of its burden of proof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. \nBd. Mar. 30, 1995) (\u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s admissions, whether testimonial or written, can \nprovide a legal basis for an Administrative Judge\u2019s findings\u201d). Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n(b) apply. The next inquiry is whether the security concern is mitigated. \n \n Applicant signed up as a linguist and a cultural advisor for U.S. and coalition forces \nin Iraq in 2003, when she was about 18 or 19 years of age. The conditions of employment \nwere, that because of force protection measures, Applicant was required to live and work \nalongside of U. S. and coalition troops in Iraq. She was not allowed to communicate in \nany way with her immediate family members in Iraq while she was deployed. On average \nher deployments to Iraq lasted between 9 and 11 months. Between 2003 and the present, \n\n9 \n \nApplicant served six deployments in Iraq for a cumulative six years or more. That is more \ntime than many U. S. active duty service members spend in Iraq.  \n \nIn 2007 Applicant came to the United States and was fast-tracked to naturalization \ndue to her service as a linguist in Iraq. She was naturalized in 2013. By that time, she had \nmarried (in 2009 to a U.S. citizen) and had given birth to her son (in 2010). Applicant \ncontinued to make deployments to Iraq as a linguist, returning to the United States after \neach deployment for a few months. Although her marriage ended in a divorce in June \n2016, the parting was amicable. Her ex-spouse accommodates Applicant\u2019s deployments \nby caring for their son, and sharing childcare duties with Applicant when she returns from \nher deployments to Iraq. When Applicant is back from Iraq she is active in the parent \nteacher association of her son\u2019s school. And she supports and encourages the baseball \nteam he plays for.  \n \nBecause of the restrictions placed on Applicant\u2019s communications with family \nmembers while she is deployed to Iraq, over the past 16 years communications have \nbeen limited to phone calls while Applicant is in the United States in between \ndeployments. Even those communications have been curtailed lately, for two reasons. \nFirst, Applicant and her mother had a falling out in October 2017 when Applicant\u2019s father \ndied. Applicant was angered because her mother did not tell Applicant promptly about his \ndeath. Applicant vowed not to call her mother or other family members. Second, Applicant \ninterpreted the SOR as signaling the Government\u2019s disapproval of such communications. \nThe first reason is a deeply personal and credible one.  A version of the second reason \nwas argued by Department Counsel, comparing Applicant\u2019s curtailment of phone calls to \na Guideline F (financial considerations) case where applicant makes post-SOR payments \nto try to clean up his finances. I respectfully disagree that the analogy is an apt one. The \nargument cuts against the DOHA jurisprudence discussed above, that an applicant need \nnot sever all ties to the foreign country of her birth before being granted a security \nclearance. In fact, Applicant\u2019s decision to cut back on phone calls to her immediate family \nshows her prudence and appreciation of the security concerns that such contacts might \ncreate.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s meetings with family members in Iraq have been rare. She last saw her \nsiblings in 2008 or 2009, about ten years ago. The last time Applicant saw her mother \nwas in 2010 or 2011, when Applicant and her then spouse traveled to Turkey, so her \nmother could meet their then newborn son.   \n \nApplicant has no financial interests, real estate, or bank accounts in Iraq. Her \nmother does not own any land in Iraq. Applicant has no retirement accounts in Saudi \nArabia. She is not a member of any foreign groups or associations. Applicant rents her \nhome here. Since Applicant arrived in the United States in 2007, she has maintained her \nresidences here. She has checking and savings accounts in the U.S. Applicant also has \n401(k) accounts with two former employers here. Applicant\u2019s family members do not know \nwhat she does for a living. Nor do they know that she is seeking a security clearance.  \n \n\n10 \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about two of her sisters who were deemed by an Army \nintelligence command in May 2009 to be security risks was credible. Applicant flatly stated \nthat she had no knowledge about that situation until she received the SOR in December \n2017. She also said that she hoped the allegations were not true but could shed no further \nlight on those allegations. Moreover, that intelligence finding is over a decade old.  \n \nThe letters of recommendation submitted on Applicant\u2019s behalf are uniform in their \nsuperlative praise of her professionalism, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s \nloyalty to the U.S. troops in Iraq has been manifestly shown. Even before Applicant \nbecame a United States citizen in 2013, by that time she had supported U. S. troops in \nIraq for ten years. And she is continuing that support to this day. I find that mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply. \n \nGuideline C - Foreign Preference \n \n \nUnder Guideline C for foreign preference, suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt because he or she acts in such a way as to indicate a \npreference for a foreign country over the United States:  \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for \na foreign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact \nthat a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying \nwithout an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. \nThe same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or privilege of \nforeign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a \nforeign citizenship. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10, and 11 (setting forth the concern and the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions).) \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 10(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, or \npolitical office in a foreign government or military organization; and \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in any way that conflicts with U.S. national \nsecurity interests; \n \nAG \u00b6 11(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; \n \n\n11 \n \nAG \u00b6 11(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference; \n \nAG \u00b6 11(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign                  \ncitizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security interests; and \n \nAG \u00b6 11 (g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or \nthe employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. law. \n \nApplicant admitted that from April 2014 until December 2016 she was employed by \nthe Saudi Arabian cultural mission in the United States performing administrative tasks. \nThat period of employment began five years ago and at a time when Applicant had \nbecome a naturalized U. S. citizen. Nevertheless, AG \u00b6 10(d)(1) is sufficiently broad to \nencompass such employment as a potentially disqualifying condition. The next inquiry is \nwhether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nIraq and the United States have been allies since 2003, when we invaded Iraq to \noverthrow the Hussein government.  That was the same year that Applicant signed up as \na linguist and cultural advisor supporting U. S. and coalition forces. At that time, \nApplicant\u2019s Iraqi citizenship, based on her parents\u2019 citizenship and being born in Iraq, was \napparently not deemed to be in conflict with U. S. national security interests. Applicant\u2019s \nmost evident preference, then and now, was to serve American interests. She has stated \nher intent to renounce any dual citizenship she may have with a foreign country. Finally, \nit is fair to assume that Saudi Arabia\u2019s cultural mission was authorized to employ U. S. \ncitizens, which Applicant was by 2014. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a) through (c), and (g) apply.  \n \n \nThe evidence of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iraq does not raise doubts about her \nreliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In \nreaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the \nfavorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due \nconsideration to the whole-person concept. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6).) \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n   For Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g:                   For Applicant \n \n\n12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C  \n   For Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:                    \n   For Applicant  \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant access to classified information. \n  \n \n \nPhilip J.

Applicant failed to disclose \nhis marriage to the Pakistani citizen during his September 30, 2013 counterintelligence \ninterview. Foreign influence and personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 26, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On June 28, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

(HE 3) The Government \nrequested a hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 7; file) On April 18, 2018, Department Counsel was \nready to proceed. On April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to another administrative \njudge, and on October 16, 2018, the case was transferred to me. On November 7, 2018, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for January 23, 2019. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits, and Applicant \noffered eight exhibits. (Transcript (Tr.) 22-29; GE 1-6; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-H).  \nApplicant objected to the admissibility of GE 2-6 because there was no authenticating \nwitness for the counterintelligence or security-related investigative documents. (Tr. 23-\n24) I deferred ruling on the admissibility of GE 2-6. (Tr. 25) After voir dire of Applicant \nconcerning the documents, Applicant posed no objection to them, and they were \nadmitted into evidence. (Tr. 85-96) All other proffered exhibits were also admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 25, 29-30, 84) On January 31, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the \nhearing. The record was held open until February 22, 2019, and Applicant provided two \nadditional documents, which were admitted without objection. (Tr. 182-183; AE I; AE J)  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Pakistan and \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 18-19; GE 7-8) Applicant requested administrative notice concerning \nadditional information about the positive relationship between the United States and \nPakistan. (Tr. 12-13; AE A) There were no objections to me taking administrative notice \nof facts concerning these two countries, and all requests for administrative notice were \ngranted. (Tr. 13-14; AE A; GE 7-8) Department Counsel\u2019s request for discovery was also \nadmitted. (Tr. 23; GE 9) \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

I have also taken administrative notice of basic facts about the history, \ngeography, population, and diplomatic relationship between the United States and \n\n \n3                                                                                                                                             \nAfghanistan from the U.S. State Department Background Note for Afghanistan (Nov. 28, \n2011), https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/afghanistan/191350.htm. (HE 4) \n  \nDepartment Counsel moved to withdraw SOR \u00b6 2.b. (Tr. 10) Applicant concurred \nwith withdrawal of SOR \u00b6 2.b, and I granted the motion. (Tr. 11)  \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e to allege \nthat Applicant\u2019s two stepchildren are citizens and residents of Pakistan (\u00b6 1.d), and \nApplicant had a relationship with an Afghan government official (AGO) (\u00b6 1.e). Applicant \nsaid he was from the same city as AGO, and he met AGO as part of his linguist duties. \n(Tr. 151) He frequently communicated with AGO while he was working as a linguist and \non his own initiative. He denied that AGO was his friend, and he said he has not \ncommunicated with AGO for about one year. (Tr. 151-152) Applicant did not tell AGO \nabout his family that may have been living in Afghanistan. (Tr. 153-154) He did not trust \nAGO with personal information about his family because Applicant was concerned that \nAGO might use pressure or extortion against Applicant. (Tr. 154) Applicant\u2019s counsel \nopposed the motion to amend the SOR, and I denied the motion. (Tr. 145-157) \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed \nfive circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApril 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s relationships with his \nstepchildren living in Pakistan will be considered for the five purposes listed above. His \nrelationship with AGO will not be considered because he has not contacted AGO for at \nleast one year, and this relationship was not sufficiently close to raise a security concern.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. He also provided extenuating and mitigating \ninformation. (HE 3) After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I \nmake the following findings of fact.  \n \n                                            \n1 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information. \n \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant is 51 years old, and he is seeking employment in Afghanistan as a CAT \nII linguist. (Tr. 31) He returned to Afghanistan shortly after his hearing to continue his \nduties as a CAT I linguist (no security clearance) supporting U.S. Forces.  \n \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan. (Tr. 31) The Russian soldiers occupying \nAfghanistan at that time abused him and his family. (Tr. 34) He received a high school \ndiploma in Afghanistan. (GE 6) He immigrated to the United States in 1995. (Tr. 31) In \n1997, he became a U.S. resident alien. (Tr. 39) He was married to a U.S. citizen from \n1997 to 2000, and he obtained U.S. citizenship through this marriage; however, he said \nhe did not commit immigration fraud. (Tr. 40-41, 88) In 2005, he became a U.S. citizen. \n(GE 1) \n \nFor about 14 years, Applicant worked in the fast-food industry in the United \nStates, and he was promoted to regional director of a large fast-food franchise. (Tr. 38, \n111-11) He believed his employer violated an agreement2 and did not pay him \nsufficiently, and left that employment and became a linguist. (Tr. 38)  \n \nIn 2009, Applicant began working as a linguist in Afghanistan. (Tr. 36) He was \nrepeatedly exposed to combat conditions including small arms fires, indirect weapons \nfires, improvised explosive devices (IED) and rocket-propelled grenades (RPG). (Tr. 42) \nSoldiers were killed in operations in close proximity to him. (Tr. 43) On one occasion his \nvehicle was hit with an IED and turned over. (Tr. 44) Applicant has experienced \nproblems with his sleep and memory, and he attributes his medical problems, in part, to \nhis service in Afghanistan. (Tr. 45) As recently as 2018, he was on patrols that \naccomplished the death of Taliban military personnel. (Tr. 47) \n \nForeign Influence \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen and \nresident of Pakistan (\u00b6 1.a); and his mother and brother are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c). \n \nAround 1999, the Taliban killed Applicant\u2019s father. (Tr. 35-36, 59, 138-139) \nAround 2001, the Taliban killed his sister. (Tr. 36, 138-139) Applicant\u2019s mother was a \nhousewife, and he has not heard from his mother since about 1998 or 1999. (Tr. 58, 61, \n146) He does not know if his mother is alive or dead. (Tr. 58) He does not know where \nhis mother lives. (Tr. 59) His brother was a farmer, and his most recent contact with his \nbrother was in 1995. (Tr. 60-61) He does not know where his brother currently resides. \n                                            \n2 The SOR did not allege that Applicant was addicted to gambling, or that he stole about $50,000 \nfrom his fast-food employer. (Tr. 113-123) He said in an interview that in 2013, he was addicted to \ngambling, and he lost about $200,000 gambling. (Tr. 122-126; GE 6) His fast-food employer claimed \n$50,000 was missing, and Applicant was responsible for the loss. (Tr. 114-122; GE 6) Applicant told his \nemployer that his employer could deduct the loss from the $200,000 debt his employer owed him. (Tr. \n114) Applicant said if his girlfriend stole the missing funds, he would take responsibility for the loss. (Tr. \n116) He denied responsibility for the loss of $50,000. (Tr. 157) No adverse inference is drawn against \nApplicant for having a gambling addition or the missing $50,000 because the record of this conduct is not \nsufficiently developed to establish whether he currently has a gambling addiction or that he stole from his \nfast-food employer. \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \n(Tr. 60) His mother and brother did not have any connections, such as employment, with \nthe Afghan government. (Tr. 62)   \n \nIn March 2013, Applicant married his wife, and then she went to Afghanistan and \nmet with Applicant. (Tr. 63, 65, 96, 142) She is 49 years old. (Tr. 140) In 2013, he spent \nabout two weeks with his spouse. (Tr. 65, 96) He most recently met with his spouse in \n2014. (Tr. 65) She resides in Pakistan. (Tr. 76) He communicates with his spouse using \nSkype. (Tr. 66) His spouse has an 8th grade-level education, and she lived with her \nbrother until he died. (Tr. 66) His spouse has two children who are ages 23 and 24, and \nApplicant provides financial support to her, and she uses the funds to support his \nstepchildren. (Tr. 67-68, 143) In 2018, he provided about $6,500 in support to her. (Tr. \n161)  \n \nApplicant applied to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) two or \nthree times in the last several years for his spouse to immigrate to the United States; \nhowever, each time \u201cpictures were lost or something.\u201d (Tr. 98) Applicant acknowledged \nthat he has not provided all of the necessary paperwork to the USCIS for the USCIS to \napprove her residence in the United States; however, he contended that he is close to \nobtaining approval of his spouse\u2019s immigration to the United States. (Tr. 67, 69, 99) For \nexample, he has not completed the required affidavit of support. (Tr. 99-100) For about 9 \nmonths or maybe 18 months, he was focused on his own medical problems and not on \nthe INS\u2019 requirements for his spouse\u2019s immigration. (Tr. 100-103, 141) However, she \nmay have wanted to delay her move to the United States. (Tr. 67, 69) He expects she \nwill move to the United States within one year. (Tr. 68) She has never been to the United \nStates. (Tr. 76) He communicates with her about twice a week. (Tr. 141; GE 5 at 1)  \n \nApplicant could not go to Pakistan to see his spouse because he was well known \nin Pakistan due to his work as a linguist, and \u201cit was very risky for [him] to go there . . . [it] \nwould be very risky for [his] life.\u201d (Tr. 141) The only time he met his wife in person after \ntheir marriage was in a third country (not Pakistan or the United States) in 2014. (Tr. \n141-142)  \n \nIn 2015, Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s brother was killed by the Taliban. (Tr. 140, 162) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and his stepchildren live in the house that was once owed by her \nbrother. (Tr. 162) Applicant\u2019s stepchildren now own the home in Pakistan that they \ninherited from Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s brother. (Tr. 162)  \n \nApplicant has some bank accounts in the United States with about $15,000 in \nthem; however, he does not own any real estate in the United States. (Tr. 77) He owns a \ncar and rents an apartment in the United States. (Tr. 78) He was unsure of the status of \nsome land his father owned in Afghanistan, and he does not own any property in \nPakistan. (Tr. 79) Applicant renounced his Afghan citizenship. (Tr. 163) Applicant does \nnot have any relatives that live in the United States. (Tr. 163)  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant was terminated from \nemployment as a government contractor in April 2013 for job abandonment (\u00b6 2.a); \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant failed to disclose that he did not provide financial support to his second spouse \non his April 26, 2016 SCA (\u00b6 2.c); and Applicant failed to disclose that he was married to \nhis second spouse, a citizen and resident of Pakistan, during a counterintelligence \ninterview on September 13, 2013 (\u00b6 2.d).  \n \nIn April 2013, Applicant was on leave from Afghanistan in the United States. (Tr. \n49-50) An investigator was interviewing him, and he missed his flight back to \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 50, 105-106) He called his employer about missing his flight, and was \ninformed that he needed to report to Afghanistan as scheduled. (Tr. 50-52) He told his \nemployer he could not report on time. (Tr. 52) He waited for a follow-up response from \nhis employer for one week, and then he was informed he was terminated for not \nreporting on time to Afghanistan. (Tr. 52) In September 2013, he applied for employment \nwith the same employer, and in January 2014, he returned to Afghanistan, and he was \nemployed by the same employer that fired him in April 2013. (Tr. 53-55) After eight \nmonths working as a linguist with the U.S. Marines in Afghanistan, the Marines and \nApplicant returned to the United States as part of the drawdown in U.S. Forces in \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 55) \n \nA copy of Applicant\u2019s 2013 SCA is not part of the record. The summary of \nApplicant\u2019s September 30, 2013 counterintelligence interview and a chart of relatives do \nnot contain any information about his spouse or stepchildren in Pakistan. (Tr. 128; GE 2; \nGE 3) His 2013 counterintelligence summary of interview indicates he disclosed that he \nresides with his \u201cex-girlfriend\u201d and her children, and he provides financial support to her \nand her children. (GE 2 at 13) He said his ex-girlfriend and best friend is a U.S. citizen. \n(GE 3) He also discussed his marriage from his previous spouse in 2001, and he \nprovided information about her U.S. citizenship. (GE 2 at 13; GE 3) In sum, the only \ninformation disclosed during his 2013 counterintelligence interview related to his \nrelationships with a girlfriend and former spouse, and both of these women were U.S. \ncitizens. He did not disclose his marriage to a citizen and resident of Pakistan. \n \nIn his April 26, 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he married his second spouse \nin July 2013, and she lived in Pakistan. (Tr. 74; GE 1) On his April 26, 2016 SCA he did \nnot disclose that he had two stepchildren as a result of his second marriage, and he said \nhe did not provide any financial support to a foreign national. (SOR \u00b6 2.c; GE 1) During \nhis May 2, 2016 counterintelligence interview, he said that he did not disclose his March \n2013 marriage to his second spouse on his previous SCA and counterintelligence \ninterview because he was worried about how it would look to be married to a Pakistani \nwoman while working for U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. (Tr. 131-132; GE 4 at 9 (Item 35)) \nHe disclosed his two stepchildren during his May 2, 2016 counterintelligence interview. \nId.      \n \nApplicant\u2019s April 26, 2016 SCA asked Applicant whether he ever provided \nfinancial support for any foreign national, and he responded, no. (Tr. 69; GE 1) He said \nhe misinterpreted the question, as he believed it pertained to support of individuals other \nthan his spouse. (Tr. 71, 135) In June 2016, an Office of Personnel Management \ninvestigator interviewed Applicant, and he disclosed that he provided $500 to $1,000 \nmonthly to his spouse. (Tr. 133-134)  \n \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant said that during his 2013 counterintelligence interview, he did not \ndisclose his marriage to his spouse because he \u201cwas never asked any questions [about \nhis spouse], and it totally went out of [his] mind that [he] should put his wife at that time.\u201d \n(Tr. 73) He said he was unsure about what he was thinking when he was interviewed. \n(Tr. 165) He conceded he \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d (Tr. 74) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant worked for an employer providing overseas linguists from October 2009 \nto May 2013, from January 2014 to November 2014, and from September 2017 to \npresent. (Tr. 57; AE G) He received some unit coins from commanders for his \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. (Tr. 83; AE H) \n \nIn 2010, a first sergeant noted that Applicant \u201cplaced himself in personal danger \ncountless times.\u201d (AE C) He is an \u201cinvaluable force multiplier\u201d and will be an asset to \nmilitary units in the future. (AE C) The Army infantry unit suffered numerous casualties \nincluding 22 killed in action, and Applicant was present during dangerous combat \noperations, and he risked his life on a daily basis. (AE C) He received a certificate of \nappreciation for his exceptional contributions to mission accomplishment, diligence, and \n\u201ccan-do attitude\u201d in 2009 and 2010. (AE F)  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant received a National Guard Commendation Medal approved by \nthe Governor of a state. (AE I; file) He also received an excellent rating for his \ncontributions to an Army unit as a linguist in Afghanistan. (AE I) An Army brigade \ncommander indicated in his performance evaluation: \n \n[Applicant] is a tremendous interpreter, one of the best with whom I have \nserved. His performance as the interpreter of a forward deployed \nmultinational brigade in combat has been simply superb. He is a dynamic \nindividual who uses initiative and boundless energy to improve the \noperational effectiveness of all units within the command and the Soldiers \nin them through his interaction with . . . leaders. \n \nHe is a dedicated professional with an extremely positive attitude and a \nkeen ability to form cohesive teams in an international environment. \n[Applicant] is able to interact with ease to any Pashto or Dari speaking \nindividual - a trait essential to relationship building in [this area]. \n \n[Applicant] is a confident individual who understands operational and \nstrategic imperatives as he circulates in [this] battle space. During his \ntenure as the Commander\u2019s Interpreter for [this] Combined Team . . . , his \npersonal influence on Afghan interaction has enabled the team to \ndrastically improve the stability, security, governance and development \ncapabilities in [this area]. (AE I) \n \nApplicant received multiple certificates of appreciation and letters of support from \na linguist, a captain, a major, a sergeant first class, and his employer for his contributions \nto an armed counterintelligence screening team. (AE B; AE D; AE E; file) One certificate \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \nof appreciation praised him for his professionalism, \u201ccalm demeanor and smooth talking \nability.\u201d (AE B) He is one of the most effective and dedicated linguists supporting the \nteam. (AE B) The contractor lauded his exceptional ability as a translator as well as his \ntrustworthiness, efficiency, reliability, and diligence. (AE D) He also received an excellent \nSoldier Performance Appraisal Report form service from November 1, 2010, to January \n2, 2011. (file)    \n \nAfghanistan \n \nAfghanistan is a country in Southwestern Asia that is approximately the size of \nTexas (249,935 square miles). Pakistan borders it on the east and the south. Iran \nborders it on the west and Russia to the north. It is a rugged and mountainous country \nwhich has been fought over by powerful nations for centuries. In 2009, the population \nwas about 28 million people with about 3 million Afghans living outside Afghanistan, \nmainly in Pakistan and Iran, although over 5 million have returned since the removal of \nthe Taliban regime. \n \nAfghanistan is presently an Islamic Republic with a democratically-elected \npresident. Afghanistan has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the \nSoviet Union in 1979. After an accord was reached in 1989, and the Soviet Union \nwithdrew from Afghanistan, fighting continued among the various ethnic, clan, and \nreligious militias. By the end of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of \nthe country, imposing aggressive and repressive policies.   \n \nIn October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in the \ncountry, forcing the Taliban out of power by November 2001. The new democratic \ngovernment took power in 2004 after a popular election.  \n \nA U.S. State Department Travel Advisory remains in effect for Afghanistan at \nTravel Advisory Level 4-Do not travel. The State Department warns U.S. citizens \nagainst travel to Afghanistan because of continued instability and threats by terrorist \norganizations against U.S. citizens. Travel to all areas of Afghanistan remains unsafe \ndue to the ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, suicide bombings, military \ncombat operations, landmines, terrorist and insurgent attacks, banditry, armed rivalry \nbetween political and tribal groups, militant attacks, direct and indirect fire, and \ninsurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne or other IEDs. Attacks may also \ntarget official Afghan and U.S. governmental convoys and compounds, foreign \nembassies, military installations, and other public areas. \n \nNo province in Afghanistan should be considered immune from violence, and the \npotential exists throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, \nagainst U.S. and other foreign nationals at any time. Extremists associated with various \nterrorist networks and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout \nthe country and remain violently opposed to the Afghan government and Coalition \nForces. These terrorist groups have attacked Afghan, Coalition Forces, and U.S. targets \nwith little regard for or the express intent to cause civilian casualties.  \n \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nAccording to the June 2017 U.S. Department of Defense report on Afghanistan, \nAfghanistan faces a continuing threat from insurgent and terrorist networks present or \noperating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Department Counsel\u2019s administrative \nnotice lists recent terrorist attacks in Afghanistan resulting in the deaths of hundreds of \ncivilians and military personnel in 2017 and 2018. \n \nIn December 2016, the Department of Defense reported to Congress that, \nalthough al-Qaeda\u2019s core leadership in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region has \nbeen degraded, elements continue to seek safe haven on both sides of the border to \nregenerate and conduct attack planning.  \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Afghanistan is balanced against \nthe inherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan to its citizens and residents \nand Afghan government problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top \nnational security goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, \ntraining, and support of the Afghanistan Government and military in the ongoing war \nagainst terrorism. \n \nPakistan \n \nPakistan is a parliamentary federal republic with a population of more than 167 \nmillion people. After September 11, 2001, Pakistan supported the United States and an \ninternational coalition in Operation Enduring Freedom to remove the Taliban from power \nin Afghanistan. The United States and Pakistan have common interests in a peaceful, \nstable, and prosperous region. Despite this support, members of the Taliban and \nseveral terrorist groups are known to operate in several \u201csafe havens\u201d in Pakistan.   \n \nPakistan has numerous human rights issues including extrajudicial and targeted \nkillings, disappearances, torture, violations of the rule of law, mob violence, and limited \naccountability. Government restrictions, corruption, and a culture of impunity are serious \nproblems in Pakistan. Lack of accountability for violations of the law and human rights \nabuses are common. \n \nSome terrorist groups have had success raising funds in Pakistan. Taliban \nfinancing has been traced from Pakistan to Afghanistan, enabling the insurgency in \nAfghanistan to strengthen its military and technical capabilities. Pakistan has intensified \nits counterinsurgency efforts, but its record for dealing with militants has been mixed. \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has defined several areas of Pakistan to be \nterrorist safe havens. Although al-Qaeda in Pakistan has been seriously degraded, \nterrorist groups continue to operate in Pakistan. Attacks have resulted in hundreds of \ncasualties.   \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens of the risks of traveling to \nPakistan in light of terrorist activity. Terrorists have attacked numerous locations \nthroughout Pakistan.   \n \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nPakistan and the United States are allies in counterterrorism. Pakistan is \ncommitted to elimination of terrorist camps on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and sent \nthousands of troops and sustained hundreds of casualties in this effort. Overall, \nPakistan has intensified counterinsurgency efforts and demonstrated determination and \npersistence in combating militants. The United States is engaging in a substantial effort \nto bolster Pakistan\u2019s military forces and security.  \n \nPresident Obama said that Pakistan is an essential partner of the United States \nin South Asia, and he committed to the shared security and prosperity between these \ntwo great democracies. The United States is Pakistan\u2019s largest trading partner. In 2013, \nthe United States invested more than $2 billion in Pakistan. United States investments \nin the energy, research and development, and education sectors are particularly \nsignificant. In 2013, the United States and Pakistan committed to strengthening \nrelationships between the two countries. President Obama said that Pakistan \nAmericans living in the United States \u201care enormous contributors to the growth and \ndevelopment of the United States.\u201d The United States has increased investment in the \nU.S. Embassy in Islamabad, and this included hiring additional personnel and \nconstruction of a new embassy.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \nAG \u00b6 7 has conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant admitted that his spouse is a citizen and resident of Pakistan; and his \nmother and brother were and possibly are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. He has \nfrequent contacts with his spouse, but not with his mother and brother. His frequent \ncontacts with his spouse in Pakistan are a manifestation of his care and concern for her. \nThe focus of the discussion must be on his family in Pakistan, and not on his family in \nAfghanistan because he has not had contact with his family in Afghanistan for more \nthan 20 years.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \u201cThe \npresence of close relatives in a country in which terrorists operate and/or which has a \npoor human rights record is significant in Guideline B cases.\u201d ISCR Case No. 11-06925 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2013) at 4 (discussing denial of access to classified information \nbecause of relatives in Pakistan). \u201cFactors such as the obscurity of foreign relatives or \nthe failure of foreign persons to contact those relatives do not provide a meaningful \nmeasure of whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances pose a security risk.\u201d Id. \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Pakistan primarily \nbecause of terrorists and criminals. Applicant has voluntarily shared in dangers from \nterrorists on behalf of the DOD when he was deployed to Afghanistan as a linguist for a \nDOD contractor, and he is willing to do so in the future. Numerous linguists, supporting \nU.S. forces, have family living in countries that have problems with terrorists and \ncriminals. Thousands of United States and coalition armed forces and civilian \ncontractors that have served in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan have \nbeen and are targets of terrorists, along with their families, located in those countries.   \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Pakistan is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or \nher spouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \n\n \n13                                                                                                                                           \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (App. Bd. May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMar. 13, 2017)). These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government coercion \nor inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Pakistan and Afghanistan with the United States, and the situations in \nthose countries places a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate \nthat his relationships with any family member living in or visiting those countries does \nnot pose a trustworthiness or security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a \nposition where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a \ndesire to assist a relative living in or visiting Pakistan or Afghanistan.3  \n \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries \nhostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting \nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is \nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \n                                            \n3 The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 n. 18 (App. \nBd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security significance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family members in \na foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on their prominence or personal \nsituation. Rather, the issue is whether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an \napplicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance [or public trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n14                                                                                                                                           \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, \n2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Pakistan or Afghanistan seek or have sought classified or economic \ninformation from or through Applicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule \nout such a possibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Pakistan \nand Afghanistan have a significant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family \nin Pakistan \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those \nwho seek U.S. information or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon \nhim.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-\n02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his wife who is a citizen and resident of Pakistan \ncreates a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on her in \nan effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. This relationship \ncreates \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d \nunder AG \u00b6 7. Her citizenship and residence in Pakistan, and Applicant\u2019s relationship \nwith her, has raised the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of \nany mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n\n \n15                                                                                                                                           \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nApplicant has not had any contact with his brother since 1995 and his mother \nsince 1998 or 1999. He does not know if they are alive or dead. Assuming one or both of \nthem are alive, he does not know if they still live in Afghanistan or have moved to \nanother country. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c). Foreign \ninfluence security concerns relating to his mother and brother will not be further \ndiscussed in this opinion.   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies to his relationships with his spouse and stepchildren \nliving in Pakistan. Applicant has frequent contacts with and provides financial support to \nhis spouse and stepchildren, who are citizens and residents of Pakistan.4 A key factor in \nthe AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the U.S.\u201d Applicant resided in the United States from 1995 to present, except for his \n                                            \n4 See ADP Case No. 05-17812 at 2, 3 n.2 (App. Bd.

He is renting his residence and has bank accounts in the United \nStates. He honorably served as a linguist in Afghanistan.  \n      \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Afghanistan, including the dangers that service \nentailed, weighs heavily towards mitigating security concerns. Applicant seeks a security \nclearance to enable him to continue serving the Middle East providing assistance to \nDOD. He has shown his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his \nsupport to DOD while serving in Afghanistan.   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of \ndangerous high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant \ncontribution to national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Mar. 19, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States and service in Afghanistan must \nbe weighed against the potential conflict of interest created by his relationships with \nrelatives who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Applicant has close relationships \nwith family in Pakistan, and they are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights \nviolations of those countries\u2019 governments.  \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 historical investment of \nmanpower and money in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and Applicant has supported U.S. \ngoals and objectives in those countries.

May 24, 2018) the Appeal Board discussed a translator\u2019s \nmultiple tours on behalf of the United States in Iraq, limited time as a resident in the United States, and \nconnections to family living in Iraq. The Appeal Board stated: \n     \nIn general, an applicant\u2019s deployment to a combat zone in support of U.S. forces is not a \nfactor that weighs against his or her national security eligibility. On the contrary, such \ndeployments tend to establish various mitigating conditions such as [Directive] \u00b6 8(b) \n(\u201cthere is no conflict of interest . . . because . . . the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d); [Directive] \u00b6 8(d) (\u201cthe foreign . . . \nactivities are on U.S. Government business\u201d); and [Directive] \u00b6 8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine \nnature of the foreign business . . . is such that [it is] unlikely to result in a conflict of \ninterest and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.\u201d) \n \nId. at 3 (internal footnotes omitted) (remanding administrative judge\u2019s denial of security clearance). \n\n \n17                                                                                                                                           \nis a potential target of terrorists, and Applicant\u2019s potential access to classified \ninformation could theoretically add risk to his relatives living in Pakistan.   \n \nApplicant said his support to the United States is well known in Pakistan. He is \nunable to travel to Pakistan to visit his family because he will be subject to risk of injury \nor death from terrorists and criminals. \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Pakistan are too \nsignificant to mitigate in the circumstances Applicant presented. His connections to the \nUnited States taken together are not sufficient to overcome the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose that he did not provide financial support to his spouse \non his April 26, 2016 SCA, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c. This mistake was not intentional \nand was not made with intent to deceive. He disclosed the existence of his spouse in \n\n \n18                                                                                                                                           \nPakistan on his April 26, 2016 SCA. It was reasonable to assume that he was providing \nfinancial support to her, and his failure to disclose such financial support was an \nunintentional error. See also AG \u00b6 20(f), infra.   \n \nApplicant presented extenuating information relating to his termination from \nemployment as a government contractor in April 2013 for job abandonment. He missed \nhis flight due to needing to complete a security-related interview. He showed poor \njudgment when he failed to take the next available flight to report for duty. However, this \npoor judgment did not recur, is not recent, and his employer rehired him. The record \ndoes not establish AG \u00b6 19(e) because his termination from employment did not create \na vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) is established because he intentionally failed to disclose information \nabout his marriage to his spouse, who was a citizen and resident of Pakistan, as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 2.d. Consideration of mitigating conditions is required. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n \n\n \n19                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant failed to disclose that he was married to his spouse a citizen and \nresident of Pakistan during his counterintelligence interview on September 13, 2013. \nDuring his May 2, 2016 counterintelligence interview, he said that he did not disclose his \nMarch 2013 marriage on his counterintelligence interview because he was worried \nabout how it would look to be married to a Pakistan woman while working for U.S. \nForces in Afghanistan. His omission of information about his marriage to a citizen and \nresident of Pakistan during his 2013 counterintelligence interview was intentional. His \nclaim at his hearing that the investigator did not ask him about his marriage is not \ncredible. AG \u00b6 2.d is not mitigated. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant is 51 years old, and he is seeking employment in Afghanistan as a CAT \nII linguist in Afghanistan. He was born in Afghanistan, and in 1995, he immigrated to the \nUnited States. In 2005, he became a U.S. citizen.  \n \nApplicant worked for several years in Afghanistan as a linguist. He was \nrepeatedly exposed to combat conditions including small arms fires, indirect weapons \nfires, IEDs, and RPGs. Soldiers in his vicinity were killed in combat. On one occasion, \nhis vehicle was hit with an IED and turned over. Applicant has experienced problems \nwith his sleep and memory, and he attributes his medical problems in part, to his service \nin Afghanistan. As recently as 2018, he was on patrols involving the death of Taliban \nmilitary personnel. Applicant\u2019s employer and Soldiers that served with Applicant in \nAfghanistan lauded his diligence, professionalism, intelligence, and contributions to \nmission accomplishment in an evaluation, letters, statements, certificates, and a medal.  \n \n\n \n20                                                                                                                                           \nConnections to foreign countries must be balanced against connections to the \nUnited States. Applicant resided in the United States from 1995 to present, except for \nseveral years when he was serving in Afghanistan as a linguist and brief visits to other \ncountries. He is renting an apartment in the United States, and he has bank accounts in \nthe United States. He took the oath of allegiance to the United States when he became \na U.S. citizen. He does not have any relatives that live in the United States. \n \nApplicant served U.S. interests as a linguist in Afghanistan. He made \ncontributions at personal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Afghanistan. All these \ncircumstances increase the probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report \nany attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit \nhim. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). His past honorable \nservice in Afghanistan weighs heavily towards mitigation of foreign influence security \nconcerns. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (affirming grant of \nsecurity clearance and commenting \u201cApplicant has served as a translator and as a \ncultural liaison between Americans and Afghan citizens, diffusing tensions and \nfacilitating transactions between the two groups. . . . Applicant put his life in danger on \nat least one occasion to protect American lives and interests in Afghanistan.\u201d). \n \nA Guideline B decision must take into consideration the geopolitical situation and \ndangers of the country involved.6 Pakistan is a dangerous place due to violence from \nterrorists and criminals, and Pakistan\u2019s government does not respect the full spectrum \nof human rights. Terrorists continue to threaten Pakistani citizens and residents, the \nPakistan government, the interests of the United States, and those who cooperate and \nassist the United States. The United States and Pakistan are democracies, allies in the \nwar on terrorism, and trading partners. They have numerous important common \ninterests.  \n \nApplicant has frequent contact with or cares for his wife and stepchildren, who \nare citizens and residents of Pakistan. They have never been to the United States. He \nprovides financial support to his spouse and stepchildren. Applicant is well known in \nPakistan, and he believes he cannot safely visit his family in Pakistan. Frequent \ncontacts with and financial support for family in foreign countries are manifestations of \none\u2019s care and concern for relatives living in those foreign countries. There is no \nevidence that his relatives are current employees of foreign governments or foreign \nmilitary personnel. His relationships with residents and citizens of Pakistan raise \nimportant foreign influence security concerns. \n \nApplicant intentionally omitted information about his spouse in Pakistan during \nhis counterintelligence interview in 2013. He told the truth in his 2016 \ncounterintelligence interview when he admitted this omission was designed to conceal \nhis relationship with his spouse because of its security or employment ramifications. At \nhis hearing, he falsely claimed that in 2013, the counterintelligence investigator did not \nask him about his marriage.    \n \n                                            \n6 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). \n\n \n21                                                                                                                                           \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence and \npersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nAgainst APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 26, 2016. On \nJune 26, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 26, 2017, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \n02/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nwritten case on September 10, 2018, and sent a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He did not \nrespond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2019.  \n \nThe FORM included Item 4, a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) \nconducted on March 8, 2017. The PSI summary was not authenticated as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to \ncomment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, \ndeletions or updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it \nwas not authenticated. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summary by \nfailing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like \nlawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights \nunder the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old electrical designer employed by a defense contractor \nsince February 2005. He graduated from high school and attended college from \nSeptember 1981 to May 1985 but did not receive a degree. He has never married, but \nhe has lived with a cohabitant for 16 years. He and his cohabitant have resided in their \njointly owned home since June 2000. He has no children. He has never held a security \nclearance. \n \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2005 and received a discharge in \nAugust 2005. In his answer to the SOR, he attributed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy to a \nperiod of unemployment. Since receiving a discharge, he has accumulated 11 \ndelinquent debts totaling about $13,000 that are reflected in credit reports from April \n2017 (Item 5) and September 2015 (Item 6). In his answer to the SOR, he attributed his \ncurrent financial situation to the expense of adding an in-law suite to his home to \naccommodate his cohabitant\u2019s ailing mother. His cohabitant\u2019s mother provided funds for \nthe construction until his cohabitant\u2019s sister stopped the funding, under circumstances \nnot reflected in the record. Applicant completed the construction by using credit cards \nand cash advances. The delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.m are credit-card \naccounts and loans. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m is a medical bill. Applicant provided \nno information about the circumstances in which the medical bill was incurred. \n \n \nIn the March 2017 PSI and his answer to the SOR, Applicant declared his \nintention to file another petition for bankruptcy. As of the date the record closed, he had \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nnot done so. He has submitted no evidence of efforts to resolve the debts alleged in the \nSOR. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) \n(\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n5 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established for the 2005 bankruptcy, which is mitigated by the \npassage of time. It is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.l, which are \nrecent, numerous, and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence \nunlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the bankruptcy. Applicant\u2019s loss of employment was \na circumstance beyond his control, and bankruptcy was a legal and prudent course of \naction. The loss of funding for the in-law suite was a condition beyond his control, but he \nhas not demonstrated responsible conduct in resolving the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-\n1.l. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) are not established. Applicant presented no \nevidence of financial counseling beyond what would have been required for the \nbankruptcy in 2005. He presented no evidence of contacts with creditors, payments, or \npayment plans for his delinquent debts. He has not disputed any of the debts alleged in \nthe SOR. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nRemand Decision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate Common Access Card (CAC) credentialing concerns \nraised under the criminal or dishonest conduct and intentional false statement \nsupplemental adjudicative standards. CAC eligibility is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 29, 2016, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive \nPositions (SF 85). On November 9, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing concerns for CAC eligibility pursuant \nto Homeland Security Presidential Directive \u2013 12, Policy for Common Identification \nStandard for Federal Employees and Contractors, dated August 27, 2004 (HSPD-12). \nDOD was unable to find that granting Applicant CAC eligibility posed an acceptable risk.  \nThe action is based on the Supplemental Adjudicative Standards found in DOD \nInstruction 5200.46, DOD Investigative and Adjudicative Guidelines for Issuing the \nCommon Access Card, dated September 9, 2014, and the procedures set out in \nEnclosure 3 of DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The concerns raised under \nthe Supplemental Adjudicative Standards of DODI 5200.46 are criminal or dishonest \nconduct and material, intentional false statement. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 13, 2017, and follow-up email dated \nJanuary 26, 2018, and requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \n10/11/2018\n\n \n2 \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the \nSOR and stated that she wanted \u201cto discuss further in court.\u201d The case was forwarded \nto the Hearing Office and assigned to me on March 8, 2018. On August 22, 2018, a \nNotice of Hearing was sent out scheduling the hearing for April 12, 2018. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) were not available for the hearing.1 I left the \nrecord open until April 26, 2018, for Department Counsel to provide the GEs to \nApplicant. She did not object and GE 1 through 4 were later admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. After the hearing, Applicant also submitted a one-page document \nentitled closing statement that was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE A) and admitted \nwithout objection. At the hearing, Applicant testified on her own behalf. Based on the \nrecord evidence and testimony presented in this case, CAC eligibility was denied.  \n \nI issued my original decision on June 15, 2018, denying Applicant\u2019s CAC \neligibility. Applicant appealed that decision. On September 19, 2018, the Appeal Board \nremanded the case for a new decision based on the fact that I applied the wrong \nstandard for adjudicating CAC eligibility. I erroneously stated that \u201cany doubt concerning \npersonnel being adjudicated for CAC eligibility should be resolved in favor of the \nnational interest.\u201d (Policies section of original decision) In the Conclusion section, I \nstated that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant CAC \neligibility.\u201d The correct standard is set forth in Paragraph 4 of the CAC Adjudicative \nProcedures (DOD Instruction 5200.46, Encl. 4 \u00b6 4), which states \u201cThe determination will \nbe unfavorable . . . when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that derogatory \ninformation or conduct relating to the supplemental CAC credentialing standards \npresents an unacceptable risk for the U.S. Government [,]\u201d and is repeated in the initial \nparagraph of each supplemental adjudicative standard. Although the correct \n\u201cunacceptable risk\u201d standard was repeatedly referenced in the original decision, the \nerroneous references to \u201cconsistent with the national interest\u201d left confusion. I have now \napplied the correct standard and reach the same result for the same reasons.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. Her SOR answer is incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. She contends that she would not deliberately or intentionally falsify a \ngovernment form, and she has not been arrested for over five years, and has worked on \na military installation with a CAC credential for over one year.  \n \nBackground Information \n \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. She has been employed - using her CAC since \nDecember 12, 2016 by a federal contractor, aboard a military installation. (AE B, Tr. 24) \nApplicant graduated high school in 1996 and had some college courses. She was \n                                                          \n1 Department Counsel\u2019s briefcase was sidetracked en route to the hearing. I left the record open for him to \nsubmit the GEs, which had already been provided in discovery, to Applicant. I also allowed time for \nApplicant to object. She did not raise an objection.  \n \n\n \n3 \nmarried in 2004, and recently separated in 2015. She had no children by that marriage, \nbut she has a 25-year old son who still lives with her. (Tr. 24-25) She is profoundly \ndisabled. She seeks CAC eligibility as a condition of her continued employment. (GE 1; \nTr. 10) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in \u00b6 1 several minor offenses or infractions committed by \nApplicant between 2008 and 2013. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges she was charged with reckless \ndriving on March 29, 2013. Applicant admitted this and testified that she drove off at a \nhigh rate of speed after a dispute with her husband. (Tr. 24) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege \nApplicant was arrested on April 27, 2012, for theft by deception for passing bad checks \nunder $50, and other bad checks under $10. She admitted to both and testified that it \nwas one arrest but she was subsequently found guilty on all counts. (Tr. 15-16) SOR \u00b6 \n1.d alleges that on January 14, 2011, Applicant gave a false name to a police officer, \nand she was also charged with possession of marijuana (MJ) and drug paraphernalia. \nShe admitted these allegations and she was sentenced to 20 days (served over 10 \nweekends) in jail. (Tr. 28) Applicant testified that she went out to walk her dog in the \nmiddle of the night and discovered a police officer hiding in her bushes. She was scared \nand refused to provide her correct name and address. (Tr. 29) Within minutes, several \npolice officers showed up and entered her home to find a remnants of an MJ cigarette, \nand MJ residue in an ashtray. (Tr. 31) She claimed that the MJ belonged to her \nhusband and cousin. I did not find this testimony to be credible. She pled guilty to all \ncharges. (Tr. 31-32)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant was arrested for cruelty to animals on May 21, 2010. \nShe testified that she came home from work to discover her dog missing. She conferred \nwith her son and they determined that the dog was mysteriously taken by animal control \nofficers, from inside the home, because it was deprived of water. (Tr. 33-34) Applicant \noffered few details of this taking, and I did not find her to be complete or credible. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s earliest arrests were for harassing communications on April 14, 2008, \nand again on April 30, 2008. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g) She testified that both arrests \nstemmed from a dispute with another woman with whom Applicant\u2019s husband was \ncheating. (Tr. 36) This interloper supposedly followed Applicant everywhere. So, \nApplicant threatened to beat her up and the woman reported this to police. (Tr. 37-38) \nApplicant testified that a restraining order was entered mandating that she stay away \nfrom the woman for six months and then the charges were dismissed. (Tr. 38). \nApplicant has no additional arrests since 2013. Applicant provided two positive \ncharacter-reference letters attesting to her hard work and kindness. (AE A and B) She \nnotes that she is in good standing with her employer, which made special \naccommodations for her. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed her Declaration for Federal Employment (Form 306) \non December 12, 2016, she answered yes to item 9, which asked \u201cDuring the last 7 \nyears, have you been convicted, been imprisoned, been on probation, or been on \nparole?\u201d (GE 2, Tr. 40) However, she only disclosed the 2012 check offenses and the \n2011 arrest for providing false information to a policeman. She filled out the Form 306 in \na classroom setting. She testified that it was not her intent to falsify a government form. \n\n \n4 \n(Tr. 19-20) She simply forgot about all the various misdemeanors. In particular, she \nforgot to list the only offense for which she went to jail at SOR 1.d. The only reason \nApplicant could ascribe for her omissions was \u201csimple forgetfulness.\u201d (Tr. 42)  \n \n    Policies \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The specific \nissues raised are listed in DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 1, Basic Adjudicative \nStandards, and Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards. The overriding factor \nfor all of these conditions is unacceptable risk. \u201cThe determination made will be \nunfavorable . . . when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that derogatory \ninformation or conduct relating to the supplemental CAC credentialing standards \npresents an unacceptable risk to the U.S. Government.\u201d2   \n \n \nThe objective of CAC credentialing process is the fair-minded commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an \nacceptable risk to have CAC eligibility. Each case must be judged on its own merits, \ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, \nmature thinking, and careful analysis.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility.  \n \nFactors to be applied consistently to all information available include: (1) the \nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; \n(3) the recency and frequency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) contributing external conditions; and (6) the absence or \npresence of efforts towards rehabilitation. (DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, paragraph 1) In \nall adjudications, the avoidance of unacceptable risk is the paramount consideration.  \nTherefore, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for CAC eligibility should \nbe resolved against the Applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal or Dishonest Conduct \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, Paragraphs 2.a., and 2.b(1)(3)(4) and (7) articulate the CAC concern: \n \n                                                          \n2 DOD Instruction 5200.46, Enclosure 4 \u00b6 4 (Sep. 9, 2014). \n\n \n5 \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s criminal or dishonest conduct, that \nissuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk.  \n \n \nDODI Instruction 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards lists the following conditions that raises a CAC concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n2.a An individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about his or her reliability or trustworthiness and may \nput people, property, or information systems at risk. An individual\u2019s past \ncriminal or dishonest conduct may put people, property, or information \nsystems at risk.  \n \n2.b Therefore, conditions that may be disqualifying include: \n \n           (1) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses which put the safety  \n \nof people at risk or threaten the protection of property or information; \n \n(3) Dishonest acts (e.g., theft, accepting bribes, falsifying claims, perjury,     \nforgery, or attempting to obtain identity documentation without proper \nauthorization); and \n \n(4) Deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements, or other intentional financial breaches of \ntrust. \n \n \nThe Government established this disqualifying condition through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and evidence presented in the criminal history reports (GE 4).  \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, Paragraph 2.c provides a list of circumstances relevant to the determination \nof whether there is a reasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk. In \nparticular, Paragraph 2.c.(1) is applicable: \n \n2.c.(1) \u2013 The behavior happened so long ago, was minor in nature, or happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.  \n \n           The allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g concern a minor personal dispute that \noccurred over 10 years ago, and the charges were dismissed. I find that these \nallegations have been mitigated by the passage of time and are not likely to recur. \nHowever, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f have not been mitigated.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \nIntentional False Statement, Deception or Fraud \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, Paragraphs 3, 3.a., and 3.b. articulate the CAC concern: \n \n \n3. A CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to believe,  \nbased on the individual\u2019s material, intentional, false statement, deception, or  \nfraud in connection with federal or contract employment, that issuance of a CAC  \nposes an unacceptable risk.  \n \n \nDODI Instruction 5200.46, Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards \nlists the following conditions that raise a CAC concern and may be disqualifying: \n \n3.a The individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s honesty, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nput people, property, or information systems at risk; and \n \n3.b Therefore, conditions that may be disqualifying include material, \nintentional falsification, deception, or fraud related to answers or \ninformation provided during the employment process for the current or a \nprior federal or contract employment (e.g., on the employment application, \nor other employment, appointment or investigative documents, or during \ninterviews). \n \n3.c Circumstances relevant to the determination of whether there is a \nreasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk include: \n \n    (1) The misstated or omitted information was so long ago, was minor,   \n     or happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to  \n     recur; and \n \n    (2) The misstatement or omission was unintentional or inadvertent  \n    and was followed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation.  \n \n \nApplicant answered yes to a question in section 9 of her Declaration for Federal \nEmployment (Form 306) that asked about any convictions during the last seven years. \nHowever, she only listed two of her misdemeanor arrests, for check fraud and providing \nfalse information to a police officer. She omitted the most serious offenses, for \npossession of MJ and drug paraphernalia and cruelty to animals. Applicant\u2019s only \nexplanation was that she forgot to list these offenses. I did not find her explanation to be \nforthright or candid in this regard. The disqualifying condition in \u00b6 3.b above is \napplicable. She did not provide sufficient information to mitigate her lack of complete \ndisclosure on her Declaration for Federal Employment.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nDODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, CAC Adjudicative Procedures, Paragraph 1, \nGuidance For Applying Credentialing Standards During Adjudication provides the \nfollowing factors: \n \na. As established in Reference (g), credentialing adjudication considers \nwhether or not an individual is eligible for long-term access to federally \ncontrolled facilities and/or information systems. The ultimate determination \nto authorize, deny, or revoke the CAC based on a credentialing \ndetermination of the PSI must be made after consideration of applicable \ncredentialing standards in Reference (c); and \n \nb. Each case is unique. Adjudicators must examine conditions that raise \nan adjudicative concern, the overriding factor for all of these conditions is \nunacceptable risk. Factors to be applied consistently to all information \navailable to the adjudicator are: \n \n \n(1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct. The more serious \nthe conduct, the greater the potential for an adverse CAC determination. \n \n \n(2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct. Sufficient \ninformation concerning the circumstances of the conduct must be obtained \nto determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe the conduct \nposes a risk to people, property, or information systems. \n \n \n(3) The recency and frequency of the conduct. More recent or more \nfrequent conduct is of greater concern.  \n \n \n(4) The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct. \nOffenses committed as a minor are usually treated as less serious than \nthe same offenses committed as an adult, unless the offense is very \nrecent, part of a pattern, or particularly heinous. \n \n \n(5) Contributing external conditions. Economic and cultural \nconditions may be relevant to the determination of whether there is a \nreasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk if the conditions \nare currently removed or countered (generally considered in cases with \nrelatively minor issues). \n \n \n(6) The absence or presence of efforts toward rehabilitation, if \nrelevant, to address conduct adverse to CAC determinations. \n \n \n   (a) Clear, affirmative evidence of rehabilitation is required for a \nfavorable adjudication (e.g., seeking assistance and following professional \nguidance, where appropriate; demonstrating positive changes in behavior \nand employment). \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n   (b) Rehabilitation may be a consideration for most conduct, not \njust alcohol and drug abuse. While formal counseling or treatment may be \na consideration, other factors (such as the individual\u2019s employment record) \nmay also be indications of rehabilitation. \n \n  \n Applicant has overcome tremendous physical challenges and disadvantages. \nHer last offense was committed in 2013, so her misconduct has been partially mitigated \nby the passage of time. However, she has established a pattern of minor violations of \nthe law. This undermines any assurance that she will be trustworthy and reliable in \ncomplying with responsibilities of her fiduciary relationship with the government. Her \nfailure to provide a completely honest response to item 9 of her Form 306 occurred \nrecently in December 2016. It is hard to imagine how she could forget about the animal \ncruelty conviction and drug possession arrest \u2013 for which she spent 20 days in jail. \nThese were her most significant offenses. Applicant provided no explanation other than \nher forgetfulness for this glaring omission. She provided no evidence of restitution for \nthe cold checks, and her explanation for the MJ possession conviction is unavailing.  \n \n \nHaving carefully considered the facts of this case, I find \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. (1), (4) and (7) of \nthe credentialing standards are applicable. Applicant\u2019s minor violations were frequent, \nand her falsification of the Form 306 was recent. Even making allowances for her \ndisability and economic circumstances, Applicant has not met her burden in mitigating \nthe Government\u2019s concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Criminal or Dishonest Conduct:                    Against APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a  - 1.e  \n \n                           Against Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.g     \n \n \n \n      For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Intentional False Statement:                         Against APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:    \n \n \n \n \n      Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, issuance \nof a CAC card would present an unacceptable risk. CAC eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nROBERT J. KILMARTIN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 32-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time. She is employed as a security guard for a company doing business in the defense industry. She has been so employed since November 2015. She has been steadily employed other than a period of unemployment from October 2010 to August 2012. Applicant has married twice and has three minor children from her first marriage. She married the first time in October 2003 and divorced, after a separation, in January 2014. She married the second time in July 2014 and separated in February 2017.

She did not provide sufficient evidence to explain and \nmitigate her history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided against \nApplicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non February 9, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on July 10, 2017, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \n                                                          \n1 Exhibit 1. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 21, 2017. Her answers were mixed. She \nalso requested an in-person hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on October 17, 2017. The hearing scheduled for \nJanuary 23, 2018, was postponed due to a government shutdown. The hearing took \nplace as rescheduled on April 17, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. \nDepartment Counsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-\n5. Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-F. No \nwitnesses were called other than Applicant.  \n  \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. She is employed as a security guard for a company doing \nbusiness in the defense industry. She has been so employed since November 2015.  \nShe has been steadily employed other than a period of unemployment from October \n2010 to August 2012.  \n \nApplicant has married twice and has three minor children from her first marriage. \nShe married the first time in October 2003 and divorced, after a separation, in January \n2014. She married the second time in July 2014 and separated in February 2017. A \nJanuary 2014 child-support order required the father to provide medical insurance for \nthe children, and the costs of medical, dental, and vision expenses not paid by \ninsurance were shared equally between Applicant and the father.2 That was modified in \nMarch 2015 with Applicant and her ex-husband having joint legal custody of the three \nchildren; neither is obliged to pay the other child support; and she is responsible for \nproviding medical, dental, and vision insurance for the minor children.3 \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems, including a joint Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy case with her first husband ending in discharge of more than $250,000 in \nliabilities4 and 42 delinquent accounts ranging in amounts from $57 to $6,341 for a total \nof approximately $33,751. The 42 delinquent accounts in the SOR consist of 2 unpaid \njudgments, 34 medical collection accounts, and 6 consumer accounts. Several of the \nmedical collection accounts are for relatively small or minor amounts (e.g., $57). The \nSOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports from 2016 \nand 2017.5 Other than the consumer account in SOR \u00b6 1.dd for $618, the delinquent \n                                                          \n2 Exhibit A.  \n \n3 Exhibit A.  \n \n4 Exhibit B.  \n \n5 Exhibits 3, 4, and 5.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \naccounts have not been paid, settled, placed into a repayment arrangement, forgiven, \ncancelled, or otherwise resolved. The $618 consumer account was reduced to a \njudgment in March 2015, which was satisfied after making a series of payments for a \ntotal of $1,507 in December 2016.6 In addition, the delinquent consumer accounts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.l for $1,171 each are duplicates.7 And the delinquent consumer \naccount for $238 in SOR \u00b6 1.jj was included in the bankruptcy.8 \n \nConcerning the 34 medical collection accounts, Applicant explained she denied \nthe medical collection accounts in her answer to the SOR because she believes her first \nhusband is responsible for those debts.9 She admitted that she had not \u201ctouched\u201d the \nmedical collection accounts, and she was unaware of how much medical debt she \ncurrently owes.10 She presented medical billing information addressed to her that shows \nshe owes or is past due on more than $5,000.11 A review of the February 2016 credit \nreport, which was obviously relied on in drafting the SOR, shows the medical collection \naccounts are described as individual accounts.12 \n \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial situation is less than stable. She described her \nfinancial situation as living paycheck to paycheck and her husband\u2019s work history as \n\u201cvery rough.\u201d13 She has no cash savings of any kind.14 In addition to the indebtedness \ndiscussed above, she owes approximately $15,291 in student loans, which are in \nforbearance.15 She stated that she is current with filing state and federal income tax \nreturns.16 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n                                                          \n6 Exhibit C.  \n \n7 Tr. 55.  \n \n8 Tr. 58-59.  \n \n9 Tr. 50-51. \n \n10 Tr. 52-53.  \n \n11 Exhibit D.  \n \n12 Exhibit 3.  \n \n13 Tr. 62-63; 65.  \n \n14 Tr. 61.  \n \n15 Exhibit E; Tr. 62.  \n \n16 Tr. 63-64. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.17 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d18 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.19 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.20 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.21 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.22 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.23 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.24 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.25 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.26 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n17 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

The overall concern is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .27 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute of provides \nevidence of actions taken to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The two \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n                                                          \n27 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConcerning the evidence in extenuation and mitigation, Applicant is in a difficult \nsituation, and I certainly have empathy for her. But even if I set aside the numerous \nmedical collection accounts, she still has two unpaid judgments for about $8,000 and \nsome delinquent consumer debt for which she has done nothing to resolve. Her \nhousehold income is now limited to what she earns due to her marital separation. She \nhas no cash savings or financial reserve and no plan to address her delinquent debts. \nGiven the facts and circumstances of her financial situation, it is likely that most of the \nindebtedness in the SOR will remain unpaid regardless of the outcome of this case. It is \nalso likely that the financial strain she is under will increase when her student loans exit \nforbearance. Although I have credited Applicant for circumstances largely beyond her \ncontrol (the marital difficulties in particular), her evidence is not sufficient to fully explain \nand mitigate the security concern stemming from her long-standing history of financial \nproblems, which is ongoing and likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she has not met her \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m -- 1.ee: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.dd: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.ee -- 1.ii:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.jj:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.kk -- 1.qq: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \n \nMichael H.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant resigned from his job at a college in October 2014 after being repeatedly \ndisciplined for inappropriate comments and conduct toward female staff members and \nstudents since 2009. Personal conduct concerns also exist because of his lack of candor \non his security clearance application about his disciplinary infractions at the college. \nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 1, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing a security \nconcern under Guideline E, personal conduct. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n08/16/2018\n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 7, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \nOn February 9, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On February 26, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for March 20, 2018.  \n \nAt the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) were admitted in evidence. A \nFebruary 8, 2018 letter forwarding discovery of the GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs \nwere marked as hearing exhibits (HEs I-II), but were not admitted as evidentiary exhibits. \nTen Applicant exhibits (AEs A-J) were admitted in evidence, and Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 28, 2018. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant was suspended from his job at a \ncollege for ten days without pay in July 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and for five days without pay in \nJuly 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) for violating the college\u2019s sexual harassment policy; that he received \na disciplinary notice and was suspended for ten days without pay by the college in \nDecember 2012 for having inappropriate conversations with a female student (SOR \u00b6 1.c); \nand that he resigned from his position at the college in August 2014 following a complaint \nof inappropriate behavior toward a female contract employee (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Additionally, \nApplicant is alleged to have falsified his December 2015 Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (SF 86) by responding negatively to an inquiry about whether he \nhad been warned or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace in the last seven years \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e).  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he had been suspended as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but he \ndenied any validity to the female\u2019s complaint in that he was physically incapable of the \nmisconduct. Applicant also acknowledged his employment suspension alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b, but he asserted the discipline was unwarranted because his behavior consisted of \nplayful interaction and harmless social comments to a friend. Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.c \nbecause he had no recall of any disciplinary action in December 2012. Regarding SOR \u00b6 \n1.d, he explained that the accusation was a defensive action taken by a contract employee \nin an attempt to keep her job. In response to the alleged falsification of his SF 86, Applicant \nadmitted that he had not disclosed that he had received discipline or warnings, but he \ndenied deliberate falsification. He claimed that he had responded \u201cYes\u201d but then did not \nhave the specific details to complete the section and was not allowed to progress without \nthe information. (Answer.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant is 61 years old and not married. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree conferred in \n1978 and a master\u2019s degree conferred in 1991. He has been employed by a defense \ncontractor in purchasing since January 2016. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 34.) \n \nApplicant worked as a senior associate in business and purchasing services for a \ncollege from October 2005 to October 2014. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) He resigned from his \nemployment under imminent threat of discharge following incidents of sexual harassment \nor inappropriate conduct involving women. \n \nAfter informal counseling to increase his awareness of the impact of his comments \non co-workers, Applicant was suspended without pay from July 14, 2009, to July 28, 2009, \nfor violation of the college\u2019s sexual harassment policy and state regulation.1 A 20-year-old \nstudent employee (Ms. X) complained that he had looked up her skirt during inventory \nwork. He was kneeling on the floor managing paper lists and metal tags to attach to items, \nand she was standing to pull the equipment and attach the metal tags. He claims that he \nwas incapable of looking up her skirt because he was faced away from her and had neck \nproblems. However, the college\u2019s investigation revealed that he had behaved \ninappropriately toward the student during the inventory and over the previous two years, \nand that the conduct had persisted despite counseling and warnings from his supervisor. \nApplicant maintains that Ms. X initiated flirtatious behavior, and he reciprocated. Applicant \nwas warned that any subsequent violations could result in more severe disciplinary action, \nup to and including termination. He was required to have counseling through the Employee \nAssistance Program (EAP) and to attend a session of his state\u2019s sexual harassment \ntraining. He was also moved to a different building for three months. (GE 3; AE A; Tr. 40-\n47, 62.) Applicant completed the sexual harassment training and approximately six \nsessions of EAP counseling. Applicant testified, with no evidence to the contrary, that the \nEAP counselor did not see the need for further treatment. (Tr. 50-52.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisal at the college for 2009 to 2010 indicates that \nApplicant worked hard \u201cto remedy the discomfort of some female staff members cited in his \nlast evaluation.\u201d2 (GE 3.) Yet, in June 2010, an associate personnel manager at the college \nobserved Applicant flick the ponytail of a female cleaning contractor. Concerned about the \nbehavior due to his history, she spoke to Applicant about the inappropriate behavior and \nreported the incident to Applicant\u2019s supervisor, who was also the college\u2019s administrative \n                                                 \n1 Section 46a-60(8) of the state\u2019s general statutes defines sexual harassment as follows: \n \n(8) For an employer, by the employer or the employer's agent, for an employment agency, by \nitself or its agent, or for any labor organization, by itself or its agent, to harass any employee, \nperson seeking employment or member on the basis of sex or gender identity or expression. \n\u201cSexual harassment\u201d shall, for the purposes of this section, be defined as any unwelcome \nsexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when (A) \nsubmission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an \nindividual's employment, (B) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is \nused as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or (C) such conduct \nhas the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or \ncreating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s performance evaluation for mid-2008 to mid-2009 is not in evidence. \n\n4 \n \nofficer and chief financial officer. Applicant\u2019s supervisor spoke with Applicant but did not \ndiscipline him at that time. Over the next month, the supervisor received a complaint from \nthe same cleaning contractor that Applicant had asked her if she had a friend for him for a \npossible dating relationship. Then, at a welcome party at work, when a new employee \nrepeatedly told him that he looked familiar, Applicant responded to her that it appeared to \nhim that she was trying to pick him up. On another occasion, Applicant commented to a \nstaff member, who was dangling her feet, that she had nice feet. (GE 3; AE A.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor scheduled a pre-disciplinary meeting for July 9, 2010, to \nprovide Applicant an opportunity to provide reasons why the college should not dismiss him \nfrom employment for his failure to maintain appropriate behavior in the workplace. At the \nmeeting, Applicant initially indicated that his behavior was not worthy of mention.  Applicant \nwas suspended without pay from August 4, 2010, through August 10, 2010, for violating \nthe college\u2019s sexual harassment policy for having inappropriate physical contact with the \nhair of the cleaning contractor. Applicant filed a grievance, although he eventually \ncompleted additional EAP counseling mandated by the college. (GE 3; Tr. 52-57.) \nAccording to Applicant, the EAP counseling resulted in \u201cno findings of any issues.\u201d (Tr. 57.) \n \nOn August 24, 2010, an administrator with the state\u2019s employment security appeals \ndivision ruled that Applicant had been suspended for reasons other than willful misconduct \nin the course of employment. The college appealed, and on October 29, 2010, an appeals \nreferee affirmed the administrator\u2019s decision. Had the college chosen to suspend Applicant \nshortly after his intentional contact with the hair of the female contractor, the appeals \nreferee would have denied unemployment compensation as the physical contact violated \nthe proper boundaries between the female contractor and Applicant, who was in a position \nto affect her livelihood. The college\u2019s appeal was denied because it suspended Applicant \nafter he made two \u201charmless comments\u201d to other staff, and the college did not prove a \n\u201cspecific and final incident of willful misconduct\u201d triggering the discharge or suspension that \nwould have disqualified Applicant from receiving unemployment benefits. (AE A.)  Applicant \ndoes not view his conduct with the female contractor to have been problematic. He testified \nthat she was a \u201cdear friend\u201d with whom he had a very good relationship. They were \n\u201chorsing around\u201d that day, and she had no problem with it. (Tr. 58-60.) \n \nIn early December 2010, a female staff member at the college complained that \nApplicant was giving her unwelcome compliments and inappropriately asking her about the \nstatus of her personal relationships, including whether she had a boyfriend. She indicated \nthat such comments had persisted after she told him that she did not consider them \nappropriate at work and had asked him to desist. When confronted about the behavior by \nhis supervisor, Applicant explained that he learned that the female co-worker was divorced \nand so he had asked her in 2009 whether they would like to get together. She told him that \nshe wanted to keep her personal and work relationships separate. He admitted that, in \nDecember 2010, he \u201cmay have mentioned\u201d to the co-worker that her boyfriend was \u201ca lucky \nguy.\u201d He considered the conversation social chit chat and nothing more. (GE 3.) Applicant \ndoes not believe \u201cthat sort of behavior is something that should make anybody \nuncomfortable.\u201d (Tr. 48.) The incident was resolved without any disciplinary action. (GE 3.) \n \n\n5 \n \nAvailable performance evaluations for Applicant\u2019s work at the college show a record \nof competence, timely completion of tasks, and productivity. Applicant showed some \nimprovement in his interpersonal relations with staff from 2010 to 2011, but there were also \noccasions when his communications took on a perceived tone of authority. He had a \npositive attitude toward the discharge of his work responsibilities, however, and his \nperformance was considered superior in July 2012. (GE 3.) \n \nOn December 14, 2012, a college staff member observed Applicant having a \nconversation with a 17-year-old student worker, who appeared to be uncomfortable. The \nstudent worker expressed that there had been other conversations with Applicant where he \nhad shared information about his search for a young wife in the Ukraine and had told her \nthat he would have liked to have dated her if he was younger. Additionally, he had given \nher some candy with a comment that it was a \u201csweet for a sweet,\u201d and when she gave the \ncandy to another student, he told her that she broke his heart. Applicant does not recall, \nand he cannot imagine that he said \u201ca sweet for a sweet,\u201d but he admits that he probably \ntold the student that she broke his heart because he \u201chorses around.\u201d On December 20, \n2012, the college\u2019s administrative officer held a pre-disciplinary meeting at which Applicant \nexpressed surprise that the student worker might have been uncomfortable with his \ninteractions. He claimed the student encouraged the conversation about his search for a \nUkrainian wife because of their shared experience with Ukraine. She had a Russian name \nand had relatives in Ukraine, and he had traveled to Ukraine. The college suspended \nApplicant for ten days without pay because of his inappropriate interactions with the \nstudent worker and his failure to heed warnings to discontinue such behavior with staff \nmembers. Applicant filed a grievance. His defense was that the student worker was not \nbothered by the conversation and the issue was blown out of proportion. Applicant denied \nthat he had any romantic interest in somebody as young as the female student. (GE 3; Tr. \n61-68.) \n \nOn March 28, 2013, the college\u2019s president upheld the ten-day suspension. \nApplicant had been previously disciplined for similar misconduct and formally warned under \nthe college\u2019s disciplinary process not to engage female employees in conversations that \nwere not work related. The president concluded that Applicant was seemingly incapable of \ndistinguishing between safe personal conversation and intrusive, inappropriate topics. \nApplicant was advised that the onus was on him to avoid personal conversations with co-\nworkers that do not involve work-related topics, and that another, substantiated complaint \nof inappropriate personal conversations with female staff members would result in his \ntermination from employment. (GE 3; Tr. 67-68.) \n \nFor 2012 to 2013, Applicant\u2019s performance in acquiring a sustainability grant for the \ncollege was noted as exceptional. He showed competence in his work with contracts, bids, \nfacility maintenance, and summarizing financial information. He needed improvement in his \ninteractions with a female employee and with follow up on assigned tasks. He performance \noverall was rated as competent. He continued to be a very productive employee for the \ncollege over the next year. (GE 3.) \n \n\n6 \n \n \nOn August 4, 2014, a female contract employee of the college complained that \nApplicant had made inappropriate comments to her; that he was \u201ccoming on\u201d to her; and \nthat he had invited her to his home. Applicant\u2019s supervisor confronted him about the \ncomplaint on August 12, 2014. Applicant offered his resignation, but he was told to wait for \nthe college to complete its investigation. Applicant chose not to rebut the complaint, and \nadmitted during a pre-disciplinary hearing that he had engaged in flirtatious behavior with \nthe contract employee. At a meeting held in mid-September 2014 with his supervisor, \nApplicant again tendered his resignation and it was accepted.3 Applicant continued to work \nuntil October 17, 2014, the effective date of his resignation. He resigned from his \nemployment before the college completed its investigation, believing that he would be \ndischarged because he had been told that another incident would result in his termination. \nIn his opinion, any charge made by a female would have a negative result for him no \nmatter what he said or did, or whether it was accurate or not. (GE 3; Tr. 70-73.) \n \n \nApplicant filed for unemployment compensation and received benefits for the weeks \nending October 25, 2014, and November 1, 2014. On November 17, 2014, an \nadministrator for the state\u2019s employment security appeals division disqualified Applicant \nfrom unemployment compensation finding that Applicant had been discharged for willful \nmisconduct in the course of employment. Applicant appealed, and on December 29, 2014, \nan appeals referee found that Applicant had voluntarily left his position at the college, and \nthat he was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. Applicant appealed the \ndecision of the referee. Although he admitted that he had flirted with the female contract \nemployee, he maintained that she initiated the contact and that their interactions were \nconsensual. The college\u2019s witness was unable to provide sufficient information about the \ncomplaint to establish that Applicant had engaged in any unwelcome sexual advances or \nthat he created a sexually objectionable environment. The Board of Review accepted \nApplicant\u2019s version of consensual flirtatious behavior and, on March 6, 2015, reversed the \ndenial of unemployment benefits. (GE 3; AE B; Tr. 74-76.) Applicant denies that he \ncommitted any sexual harassment and submits that the female contractor wrongly accused \nhim in an effort to get her job back. (Tr. 80.) \n \n \nApplicant was still unemployed when, on December 3, 2015, he completed and \ncertified to the accuracy of an SF 86 for his current employer. He listed his previous \nemployment at the college, and indicated, \u201cLeft by mutual agreement following charges or \nallegations of misconduct.\u201d He added, \u201cAccused of harassment for which I was absolved of \nany wrong-doing post-separation.\u201d Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to the following inquiries: \u201cIn \nthe last seven (7) years do you have another reason for leaving to report for this \nemployment?\u201d and \u201cFor this employment, in the last seven (7) years, have you received a \nwritten warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined, for misconduct in \nthe workplace, such as a violation of security policy?\u201d (GE 1.) Applicant began working for \nhis defense contractor employer on January 12, 2016. (GE 2; Tr. 35.) \n \n                                                 \n3 Applicant now denies that he offered to resign a second time. He testified that his supervisor came to him \nand told him that his resignation was accepted. (Tr. 79.) However, the board that reviewed his appeal of the \ndenial of unemployment benefits found that Applicant submitted his resignation again during a meeting with \nhis supervisor in mid-September 2014. (AE B.) \n\n7 \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on March 3, 2016. Concerning the circumstances under which he left \nhis employment with the college, Applicant indicated that the college subcontracted \njanitorial services, and he was required to oversee the janitorial staff. Applicant explained \nthat a female janitor hired in the summer of 2014 had addressed him as \u201choney or Papi,\u201d \nand he had told her it was unacceptable and could not continue. After her work continued \nto suffer, he raised the issue of her work performance with her supervisor, and she was \nreplaced. Only then did she file a sexual harassment complaint against Applicant.4  \nApplicant explained that he offered his resignation because he knew that the college had a \nzero-tolerance policy. He considered himself to be absolved of all wrong doing after he \nprevailed in his appeal of the denial of unemployment benefits. Nonetheless, he was \nembarrassed by the incident, which he asserted was known about by his supervisor at the \ncollege, his neighbors, and his twin brother. The OPM investigator then asked him whether \nthere were any other issues involving his employment with the college to disclose, and he \nanswered \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 2; Tr. 86.) \n \n \nOn April 26, 2016, Applicant was re-interviewed to discuss information developed \nafter his March interview concerning his record of disciplinary infractions at the college. \nApplicant did not dispute that he had been suspended three times. He claimed he did not \ndisclose the information because he did not know the specific dates of the suspensions \nand \u201cthought the best way for him to grow was to move on.\u201d He had not kept any records \nregarding his disciplinary issues and was unable to provide all the information required on \nhis case papers. Applicant then detailed that he had a conversation with \u201ca young lady\u201d \nabout dancing for which he was issued a verbal warning (not alleged in SOR). Regarding \nthe sexual harassment that led to his first suspension, Applicant explained that he was \nworking on inventory and handing tags to a student worker, who complained that he had \nlooked up her skirt. Applicant asserted it was physically impossible for him to have done so \nbecause he had neck issues,5 but he was suspended for two weeks. According to \nApplicant, he and the student worker had a flirtatious relationship. About his second \nsuspension, Applicant admitted that he had touched the hair of the subcontractor, but he \nasserted that the woman had laughed at the time. As for the incident that led him to resign \nfrom the college, the OPM investigator asked Applicant to address a complaint of the \nfemale contractor that he had asked her to clean his home. Applicant told the OPM \ninvestigator that he thought the woman might need the work. About general complaints \nfrom female staff at the college avoiding him because he had habit of asking them for \ndates, Applicant denied any validity to their claims. He explained that his friendliness was \nmistaken by some women who assumed there was more to it. (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant was given an opportunity to review the summaries of his OPM interviews.6 \nOn October 16, 2017, he provided a detailed response in which he corrected some \ninaccuracies and offered some explanations. About his failure to disclose his employment \n                                                 \n4 Applicant testified similarly about the circumstances at his security clearance hearing. (Tr. 78-79.) \n \n5 Applicant submitted as AE J medical records from 1996 showing some damage to cervical discs. (AE J.) \n \n6 The signature page was not included in GE 2, so it is unclear when he responded to the interrogatories. \n\n8 \n \nsuspensions on his SF 86, Applicant indicated that he had destroyed all related records \n\u201cfollowing discharge from the employer,\u201d and did not think this employment history would \never be required in the future. Regarding the incidents themselves, Applicant indicated that \nenthusiasm about dancing should hardly be cause for verbal discipline. About student Ms. \nX\u2019s complaint that he had looked up her skirt during inventory, he denied that he had any \ninterest in that type of behavior and that he had ever made any sexual overtures toward \nthis student or other former co-workers. He added that even though the student worker \nknew that inventory work was scheduled and what it required, she showed up wearing a \nskirt. He asserted that he would have made a request for another co-worker to assist, but \nno one was available. Applicant explained that the incident of flicking a co-worker\u2019s ponytail \nwas innocent and not offensive to the female co-worker. About the August 2014 complaint, \nApplicant indicated that it involved him asking about house-cleaning services, and he \ninquired only because she had left business cards for such services in his office. Applicant \ndescribed himself as \u201ca friendly, gregarious person who apparently has his friendly \nintentions misinterpreted by others.\u201d (GE 2.) \n \n \nAt his hearing in March 2018, Applicant admitted his disciplinary record at the \ncollege. He attributed the incidents to him being an \u201cold-fashioned individual\u201d and to his \nlack of awareness that close proximity or a touch of an arm is considered offensive to \nsome persons. He denied any intention of untoward behavior and any intention to mislead \nduring the security clearance process. (Tr. 30-33.) \n \n \nApplicant found the need to isolate himself at his present job to avoid unintentionally \ncausing offense. (Tr. 32.) Within two months of his employment with the defense \ncontractor, he received \u201can informal written warning\u201d for inappropriately touching a young \nfemale on the hand. Applicant testified about the incident that, after a period of being \ncomfortable with her, he touched her on the hand as they were talking because he uses his \nhands expressively, or it was \u201cmaybe just totally unconscious sorts of interactions.\u201d \nApplicant denied realizing that the woman found his touch offensive until it was brought to \nhis attention at a meeting with human resources. (Tr. 35-36.) Applicant received a second \nwritten warning early in 2018 for inappropriate physical contact with another co-worker. He \ndescribed the incident as follows: \n \nAnd then there was a second event earlier this year where one of my \nassociates that regularly plans my travel services and I were sitting side by \nside and we were working on some travel arrangements and I felt we were \ngood friends. And we were horsing around and then again, I had physical \ncontact with her that was unintentional and apparently somebody witnessed \nthat and filed a complaint on her behalf. . . .Allegedly, I touched her on the \nleg while we were sitting side by side. (Tr. 36-37.) \n \n \nApplicant denied any further incidents in his present job and added, \u201cAnd I want to \nunderscore that this young lady and I have regular interactions, consider ourselves friends. \nSo the whole thing came as a surprise to me.\u201d Applicant thought he was being extra-\ncareful, but he also admitted that he had felt \u201ca high degree of comfort around them.\u201d (Tr. \n\n9 \n \n36-38.) Applicant was required by his employer to watch a sexual harassment video. (Tr. \n88.) \n \n \nConcerning his failure to report on his SF 86 or discuss during his first OPM \ninterview that he had been disciplined by the college in 2009, 2010, and 2012, Applicant \ntestified in March 2018: \n \nAgain, as I shared earlier that I did not have any of the records that are \npresented here in this employee package that was secured from [the \ncollege]. And I would not have been able to have spoken accurately about \nany of those things. And at course at this point, I didn\u2019t know what to do. And \nsince the department representative was acting on your behalf, again I did \nnot know how to proceed. I didn\u2019t have anyone to ask to inquire what to do. \nAnd again, it wasn\u2019t for the sake of trying to hide anything. It just was a lack \nof information on my part. (Tr. 83.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not think at the time to look for the decisions of the \nstate\u2019s employment security appeals division (AEs A-B) that could have helped him recall \nthe details. He did not even remember that he had them until he was preparing for his \nsecurity clearance hearing and stumbled upon them in a box of old files. When asked to \nexplain his negative response to the investigator\u2019s inquiry about whether there were any \nother issues at the college to disclose, Applicant reiterated that it was a lack of knowledge \nand not for lack of disclosure. He did not want to \u201copen the door to something that [he] \ncouldn\u2019t provide all the details about.\u201d He had destroyed his records and tried to move on. \n(Tr. 83-87.) \n \nCharacter references \n \n \nApplicant presented character references from a neighbor and some church friends, \nwho attest to his voluntary, active involvement in the church\u2019s community outreach efforts.7 \nApplicant has been honest and trustworthy in his interactions with them. (AEs D-G.) The \nexecutive director of the church\u2019s outreach program indicated that Applicant has had good \nrelationships with other volunteers and with the people served by the program. (AE F.) A \npastor who has known Applicant for more than 30 years opined that Applicant has the \nhighest moral caliber and is entirely reliable. (AE I.) The neighbor, a licensed master social \nworker, indicates that Applicant shows good judgment and determination when presented \nwith a difficult task. Applicant has an \u201cold school\u201d personality in that he does not hesitate to \ncompliment others. However, the social worker also indicated that some people \u201ccould and \nmay interpret that kindness in a negative manner.\u201d In her opinion, Applicant \u201cis always \nsincere and caring along with personable and professional at all times.\u201d  She has trusted \nApplicant with sensitive information, and she has had no issues about his ability to keep \nsensitive matters to himself. (AE G.) A longtime friend, who met Applicant 32 years ago \nthrough their interactions as church youth counselors, indicates that Applicant cannot be \n                                                 \n7 It is unclear to what extent, if any, the character references are aware of the issues concerning Applicant\u2019s \nemployment at the college, since none mention any issues. \n\n10 \n \ncoerced into committing a wrong act. In this friend\u2019s opinion, Applicant is very patriotic. (AE \nH.) \n \n \nA former co-worker in the college\u2019s distance learning department attests that \nApplicant performed his duties reliably and effectively. He worked to maintain relationships \nwith vendors and keep contractual agreements current. He was also trustworthy with \nregard to confidentiality requirements. (AE C.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \n\n11 \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigations or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nEven when viewed in a light most favorable to Applicant, the evidence establishes \nthe security concerns underlying AG \u00b6 15. Applicant was suspended by his then employer, \na college, for ten days without pay in July 2009 for violating the college\u2019s sexual \nharassment policy. He behaved inappropriately toward a 20-year-old student worker over \nthe previous two years and conducted himself inappropriately while performing inventory. \nIn August 2010, he was suspended for five days, again for violating the college\u2019s sexual \nharassment policy after he inappropriately touched the hair of a female cleaning contractor \nin June 2010. He was suspended by the college for ten days for having inappropriate \ncommunications with a 17-year-old student in December 2012 concerning his search for a \nUkrainian wife and expressing to the student that he would have liked to have dated her if \nhe was younger. In August 2014, Applicant engaged in what he termed as flirtatious \nbehavior with a cleaning contractor, but she filed a complaint with the college of unwanted \ninteractions with him that he has discrepantly explained were in response to her flirtatious \nbehavior toward him and in retaliation for her losing her job. He resigned from his \nemployment believing he would be discharged because he had been repeatedly warned by \nhis then employer to avoid personal conversations with female staff. The evidentiary record \nis not very detailed with regard to the unwanted and inappropriate conversations that led \nthe college to suspend Applicant on three separate occasions. Even so, his record of \nfailing to conform his behavior to workplace requirements implicates disqualifying condition \nAG \u00b6 16(d), which states: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n \n\n12 \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant falsified his December 2015 SF 86 by \nresponding negatively to an employment inquiry concerning whether he had received any \nwritten warnings, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in \nthe workplace in the last seven years. A reasonable inference of deliberate falsification \ncould be inferred because he was suspended three times from his employment at the \ncollege before the 2014 incident that factored into his decision to resign from his job. \nApplicant denies any intention to mislead, claiming that he answered \"no\u201d to the SF 86 \ninquiry because he did not have the details of the suspensions, including the specific dates \nand circumstance that led to him being suspended. He had destroyed his copy of his \ndisciplinary record at the college, and did not recollect that he had kept the decisions of the \nstate\u2019s employment security appeals division on his unemployment claims that contained \nrelevant and material information about his employment discipline. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \n  \nApplicant disclosed on his SF 86 that he left the employment of the college after \naccusations of sexual harassment for which he was absolved. In reversing the denial of \nunemployment benefits to him in March 2015, a state review board made a finding that \nApplicant engaged in consensual, flirtatious behavior with the female cleaning contractor \nwho lodged the August 2014 sexual harassment complaint. During his March 2016 \ninterview with the OPM investigator, he explained that he took the \u201cappeal adjudicator\u2019s \ncomment regarding the unwarranted discharge as being absolved of any wrongdoing after \nhe left the company.\u201d \n \nNothing about the review board\u2019s decision could reasonably be read as vitiating his \nprevious work suspensions or absolving him from all misconduct in the previous incidents \nthat led to his suspension on three separate occasions. Applicant\u2019s SF 86 representation \nthat he had been absolved of all wrongdoing, coupled with his negative response to the \ndiscipline question on his SF 86, leave an inaccurate impression about his employment at \n\n13 \n \nthe college. His credibility on this issue is also undermined by his lack of candor during his \nMarch 2016 interview when, after discussing the circumstances in 2014 that led him to \nresign from his employment at the college, he falsely denied that he had any other issues \nat that employment.8 Applicant knew he had been suspended. He was able to recall some \ndetails about the circumstances underlying the suspensions when he was re-interviewed in \nApril 2016.  Applicant\u2019s desire to move on from the problems at the college and to avoid \nhaving to discuss them does not justify his knowing omission of his work suspensions from \nhis SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. It provides: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is also established. Sexual harassment or unwelcome flirtatious behavior \nis conduct that, if known, could affect a person\u2019s professional, or community standing. It is \nunclear to what extent his current employer and his friends, including his church \nacquaintances and friends, know about his disciplinary issues at the college. Applicant \ndemonstrated a willingness to conceal his disciplinary record in response to legitimate \ninquiries during the security clearance process. He indicated during his March 2016 \ninterview that the 2014 incident was embarrassing to him. AG \u00b6 16(e) provides: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \n                                                 \n8Applicant\u2019s knowing false statement to the interviewer could have been disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16(b), but it \nwas not alleged. AG \u00b6 16(b) provides: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information or concealing or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical or mental health professional involved in making a recommendation \nrelevant to a national security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative. \n \nConduct not alleged can still be considered for other purposes, such as assessing an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility and factors in mitigation. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal \nBoard listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive \nSection 6.3. \n\n14 \n \nApplication of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the \npotentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. Five of the seven disqualifying conditions \nwarrant some consideration and could potentially apply in whole or in part. They are: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant had an opportunity to correct the SF 86 \nfalsification about the employment discipline imposed by the college during his March 2016 \ninterview. Instead, he falsely denied that he had any other issues at that employment. AG \u00b6 \n17(c) has limited applicability in that some of the accusations made against him by female \nco-workers, which factored into one or more of his suspensions, were not particularly \negregious. A state appeals referee considered some of the comments that factored into \nApplicant\u2019s suspension in August 2010 to have been harmless and not harassment, such \nas the comment to a then co-worker that she had nice feet. \n \nHowever, the appeals referee also indicated that Applicant\u2019s intentional contact with \nthe hair of the female contractor in 2010 violated the proper boundaries between the \nsubcontractor and Applicant, who was in a position to affect her livelihood. Had the college \nsuspended Applicant after that incident, the referee would have denied unemployment \nbenefits for Applicant. Applicant\u2019s sexual harassment may not have been particularly \negregious, but he does not deny that he flirted with female co-workers (some decades \nyounger) after he had been told to avoid personal, non-work related communications. His \nrepeated inability or unwillingness to maintain an appropriate separation between work and \npersonal matters is viewed seriously. He was suspended from the college in July 2009 for \nsexual harassment involving a 20-year-old student. After being warned that any further \ninappropriate behavior with female staff members would result in more severe disciplinary \naction, he had inappropriate physical contact with a female contactor in 2010. He made a \n17-year-old student uncomfortable in December 2012 by his conversations about dating \nand looking for a wife. Regarding the August 2014 complaints made by a subcontract \n\n15 \n \nfemale cleaning employee, it is noted that the state review board was provided no evidence \nto counter Applicant\u2019s assertion that he and the complainant engaged in consensual, \nflirtatious behavior. Whether or not Applicant believed that his comments would not be \nunwelcomed by the cleaning contractor, he exercised poor judgment by engaging in \nflirtatious behavior with her after he had been told by his employer to avoid such behavior. \nMore recently, in December 2015, Applicant certified to the accuracy of his SF 86 \nstatements after being informed in writing that a knowing and willful false statement could \nbe punished by a fine or imprisonment or both under Title 18, Section 1001, of the United \nStates Code. His false response to the employment discipline question constituted criminal \nconduct that raises serious concerns about his judgment and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant has not shown adequate reform under AG \u00b6 17(d), either of his \ninappropriate conduct with female co-workers or of his SF 86 falsification. He has yet to \nmeaningfully acknowledge his responsibility for his personal conduct. Despite his \nmandatory completion of EAP counseling and sexual harassment training, he blames the \nstudent worker for the 2009 inventory incident, claiming that they had a flirtatious \nrelationship, and she arrived for work wearing a skirt, despite knowing the requirements of \ninventory work. He shows little recognition of the fact that he violated the boundaries that \nhe had to maintain because he was in a position to affect the livelihood of the female \ncontractors in the 2010 and 2014 incidents. Perhaps most significantly going forward, he \nhas been disciplined twice by his current employer for similar concerns involving female co-\nworkers, most recently in early 2018 for improperly touching a female co-worker\u2019s knee \nwhile sitting beside her. Applicant is seemingly incapable of understanding the effects of \nhis personal behavior on his co-workers. Regarding his SF 86 omission, Applicant shows \nlittle reform by continuing to assert that his omission was somehow justified because he did \nnot have the records of his suspensions. \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 17(e), Applicant cannot reasonably be expected to detail his work \nsuspensions and the conduct that led to the disciplinary action to friends and associates \nthat may have no legitimate need to know. At that same time, he has admitted that the \n2014 complaint that led to his resignation is embarrassing for him. Even taking Applicant at \nhis word that his brother and neighbors know about the 2014 incident, it is not clear that \nthey know about his earlier suspensions. None of his character references commented \nabout the suspensions, although a neighbor indicated that Applicant\u2019s friendliness and \nkindness could be interpreted by some in a negative manner. Issues of vulnerability are \nminimized somewhat, however, because the Government is aware of some of the details \nabout his personal conduct involving female former and present co-workers and \ncontactors. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) has minimal applicability. It is unclear whether Applicant committed \nsexual harassment of the cleaning contractor in August 2014. She complained that \nApplicant came onto her and invited her into his home. Applicant has variously asserted \nthat he flirted with her in response to her advances because he was flattered by her \nattention, but also that he told her it was inappropriate to call him honey and she filed an \nunfounded sexual harassment complaint in an effort to regain her job. He exercised \nquestionable personal judgment, given he was in a position to affect her livelihood, and he \n\n16 \n \nhad been told not to engage female co-workers in personal conversations. For the reasons \nnoted, Applicant\u2019s personal conduct remains a security concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn the whole-person evaluation, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).9 Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under \nGuideline E, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s work for the college was competent and in some aspects superior. He is \nwell regarded by his neighbors, church friends, and church clergy. Yet, it is well settled that \nonce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Sexual harassment can substantially interfere \nwith a person\u2019s work performance or create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work \nenvironment. Unwanted comments or inappropriate behavior at the workplace need not \nmeet the legal definition of sexual harassment to engender security concerns. In that \nregard, Applicant\u2019s record of suspensions in his previous employment and his discipline in \nhis present job for inappropriate behavior toward female co-workers cast serious doubt \nabout his current security worthiness. His lack of candor about his disciplinary record when \ncompleting his SF 86 reflects an unacceptable tendency to act in self-interest and creates \nsignificant doubt about whether the Government can rely on his representations. After \nconsidering all the evidence, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n                                                 \n9 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n17 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

An individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding information.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information in a public trust position is \ndenied. \n Statement of the Case \nOn January 25, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) effective within the DOD for \nSORs issued after June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant timely answered the SOR on February 16, 2018, and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 16, \n2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \non November 20, 2018, scheduling the hearing on December 4, 2018. I conducted the \n01/24/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing as scheduled and Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 5 were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A - O were also admitted without objection. I left the \nrecord open until January 14, 2019, for the parties to submit supplemental \ndocumentation. (Tr. 71) Department Counsel submitted a supplemental credit report \ndated January 15, 2019. This was marked as GE 6 and admitted without objection. \nApplicant did not submit post-hearing documents during this period. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 2, 2019. \n \n \n \n                      \n \n  \nApplicant is 41 years old. She obtained a general equivalency diploma (GED) in \n2003 and had some college courses. She was married in 2010, and she has four \nchildren, ages 16, 18, 20, and 27. (Tr. 64-66) The three youngest children reside with \nApplicant and she also provides for her 1 \u00bd year-old grandson. Applicant\u2019s husband is \nincarcerated and has provided no child support. She reports no military service. She \nhas been working as a customer-service advocate in a position of trust at a federal \nhealth-care provider since December 2016, with no problems. (Tr. 64, 99) Applicant was \nunemployed for a period of eight or nine months when she had two back surgeries in \n2014-2016. (Tr. 80) After she submitted a worker\u2019s compensation claim to a previous \nemployer, she was terminated. (Tr. 95)  \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied most of the alleged delinquent debts \nplaced for collections, including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h through 1.l. The \nalleged delinquent debts total $29,221. In addition to the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nApplicant has three charged-off delinquencies, and eight consumer or medical debts \nplaced for collection. She claims in her answer that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f is \ndisputed. \n \n \nApplicant testified that she used a template obtained on the internet and sent \nseveral letters to creditors by certified mail requesting validation of her various debts \npursuant to the Fair Debt Collections Procedure Act (FDCPA). (Tr. 15, AE N) She sent \ncertified letters to the creditor corporation in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g requesting validations \nregarding two accounts placed for collection. (AE C and D) The creditor responded with \na June 14, 2018, letter that said Applicant\u2019s request for validation was not specific \nenough and it was frivolous. (AE E) Applicant also sent three letters requesting \nvalidation to the medical creditor at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k. (Tr. 30-31) That creditor \nresponded with a letter validating the debts and confirming the amounts owed. (AE H)   \n \n \nApplicant testified she had a telephone conversation August 10, 2018, with \nConstance, who assured her that all of the accounts for medical debts with the creditor \nat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k would be removed within 30 days. The creditor was supposedly \nunable to validate these debts as requested by Applicant. (Tr. 36-38, AE I) The letter \nfrom this creditor to Applicant concerning a debt for $159 contains a handwritten \nannotation by Applicant about the conversation with Constance. (AE I) That \nconversation followed Applicant\u2019s June 30, 2018 letter to the medical creditor requesting \nvalidation. Another similar letter referred to a $22 debt owed to the same creditor. (Tr. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n45-47) SOR \u00b6\u00b61.j and 1.k are for medical debts, which the creditor validated and \nconfirmed in a response to Applicant\u2019s letter. (Tr. 74, AE M)    \n \nApplicant waived her requisite 15-days\u2019 notice at the outset of the hearing as the \nnotice of hearing was dated November 20, 2018, for a December 4, 2018 hearing. (Tr. \n7-8, 39) The record was left open until January 14, 2019, specifically so that Applicant \ncould provide follow-up documentation showing that these medical debts were removed \nfrom her credit report. (Tr. 39, 42) She also expressed an interest in consulting with an \nattorney during the interim. (Tr. 42) She produced no supplemental documentation or \nnotice of appearance from an attorney. However, department counsel produced an \nupdated credit report dated January 15, 2019, post-hearing. This was admitted without \nobjection. The medical debts alleged in the SOR do not appear on this updated credit \nreport. (GE 6)  \n \nApplicant testified that the judgment alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a in the amount of \n$6,079 is the result of her eviction from her home in 2013. (Tr. 55) The judgment was \nentered against Applicant in June 2013. (GE 2, 4) Applicant testified that she called the \nproperty-management company in an effort to compromise this judgment, to no avail. \n(Tr. 56) She also claims that she called the court where the judgment was entered, but \nshe produced no documentation addressing her efforts to compromise this judgment or \npay it off.  \n \nThe charged-off debt in the amount of $8,294 alleged in SOR \u00b61.b was for an \nautomobile loan, which Applicant co-signed with her daughter. Applicant admits it is a \nvalid debt. (Tr. 56) Her daughter stopped making payments and the vehicle was \nrepossessed after the daughter\u2019s boyfriend used it in a high-speed chase while fleeing \nfrom police. (Tr. 57-58) SOR \u00b61.c is also for an automobile repossession in March 2018. \n(Tr. 59) This account was opened in August 2015. (GE 3) Applicant\u2019s husband bought \nher a car for her birthday. Then, he lost his job and stopped making payments. \nApplicant disputed this debt and the creditor has removed this debt from her credit \nreport by a June 2, 2018 letter. (AE J)   \n \n \nApplicant testified that she also purchased a used car, which turned out to be a \nlemon, and this resulted in the debt placed for collection in the amount of $4,010 at \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr. 60) The vehicle had a cracked engine block that the dealer refused to \nfix. So, she stopped making payments and it was also repossessed. (Tr. 60) SOR \u00b6 1.e \nand 1.f arose from Applicant\u2019s supposedly fraudulent personal loans, in the amount of \n$1,740 and $589, obtained from the same lender. (Tr. 61) Applicant never received the \nmoney promised from these personal loans and she has requested validation. (Tr. 91) \nShe has contacted somebody named \u201cBaby\u201d who is supposed to validate these debts. \n(Tr. 62) The debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.e was sold to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f. Her most \nrecent credit report reflect a zero balance owed on these accounts and states \u201cpaid and \nsold.\u201d (GE 6) \n \n \nApplicant testified she has not reached out to contact the creditor in SOR 1.g \nconcerning the past-due debt in the amount of $79. (Tr. 61-63) She simply has no extra \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmoney as a single mother feeding and housing four children and a grandson on her \nsalary of $11.78 per hour. (Tr. 95)  SOR \u00b61.h is a delinquent medical debt in the amount \nof $545. Again, Applicant testified that she asked the creditor for validation. (Tr. 68) The \ncreditor produced a letter in response dated August 28, 2018, which validated the debt \nand confirmed the amount. (AE H) SOR \u00b61.i is a delinquent debt in the amount of $538 \nresulting from Applicant\u2019s cancelled automobile insurance. She testified that she has not \nreached out to the creditor or taken any action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 73) She does \nnot know anything about the medical debt for $18 in SOR \u00b61.l. (Tr. 75)  \n \n \nAppellant testified that she earns $1,600 a month after taxes and she does have \nsome semblance of a budget. (Tr. 82) She has no residuary income after paying \nexpenses. Her rent is $560 per month and she receives no general assistance except \nfor her subsidized housing. (Tr. 86-87) She had no financial counseling beyond the \ncredit-builder\u2019s information publicly available on the internet. (Tr. 81) Applicant also \nowes over $100,000 in student loans for which she received a hardship deferral, \naccording to her most recent credit report. (GE 6) It is unclear how she will ever repay \nthem. She provided no evidence of any repayment plans with her remaining creditors or \nperformance evaluations from her employer. She provided two very positive character \nreferences from co-workers attesting to her work ethic, trustworthiness and honesty. \n(AE A \u2013 B) One noted that Applicant turned in approximately $10,000 dollars that was \napparently stolen in a robbery and hidden in a commode in their workplace.              \n  \n \n \n         \nPolicies \n \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Code of Federal Regulations Title 32 \u2013 National Defense, part 154.13 and part \n154, Appendix J \u2013 ADP Position Categories and Criteria for Designating Positions)  \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in DOD Directive 5220.6 before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the government\u2019s exhibits support the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions:  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in the SOR total approximately $29,221. The \ngovernment exhibits admitted at the hearing, and post-hearing supplemental \ndocuments, together with Applicant\u2019s admissions and testimony substantiate these \ndebts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from financial \ndifficulties are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nApplicant provided testimony and documentation to show that she successfully \ndisputed or satisfied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f. \n  \n \n \nIntentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct 23, 2013). Applicant sought a financial hardship deferral of her substantial \n\n \n7 \n \n \nstudent loan debts. They have not been removed from her credit report. Otherwise, she \nproduced limited documentation sent to her creditors, requesting validation of her \nvarious delinquencies. While Applicant did not deny that she incurred these debts, she \ndid not provide documentation to show payments or progress on resolving any \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. \n \n \n \n The delinquencies alleged in the SOR are longstanding and ongoing. Applicant\u2019s \nsurgeries and period of unemployment were conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, but \nshort-lived. She has not demonstrated that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. She provided no evidence of financial counseling (beyond the internet), \nor good-faith efforts to repay a judgment, student loans, or other creditors to show that \nher financial problems have been resolved and are under control. The mitigating \nconditions enumerated above apply only partially except for \u00b6 20(e) in connection with \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f.  \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Applicant is the mother of four children and she \ncares for her grandson. She has endured medical setbacks and a brief period of \nunemployment and struggled to raise a family as a single mother.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a trustworthiness concern. She has not met her \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f:               For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a,1.b,1.d,1.g -1.l:            Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a  \npublic trust position.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n     Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 4, 2014. On \nAugust 11, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline M, use of information technology and Guideline E, personal conduct. The DOD \nCAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant provided a four-page response to the SOR on September 1, 2017, denying \nall of the SOR allegations and including a two-page typed explanation of events. Applicant \nalso requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 3, 2018. On December 3, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n02/22/2019\n\n2 \n \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for December 20, 2018. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 4 were admitted into evidence without objection. I left \nthe record open until January 15, 2019, for Department Counsel and Applicant to provide \nany post-hearing documents. On January 10, 2019, Applicant provided an e-mail with three \nattachments: the court disposition from his step-son\u2019s incident; a recent Questionnaire for \nPublic Trust Position (SF-85); and a recent Declaration for Federal Employment. These \nwere marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A\u2013C respectively and admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel asked to leave the record open for an additional week and I granted \nher request over Applicant\u2019s objection. An e-mail chain marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1 \nreflects the back-and-forth colloquy. At the hearing, Applicant testified on his own behalf, \nbut submitted no documentation. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 4, 2019.  \n \n Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 50 years old. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1991 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2002. (Tr. 10-12) Applicant was married in 1992, divorced in 2006, and he \nremarried in 2009. He reports two children and two stepchildren from his wife\u2019s first \nmarriage. He previously served as a police officer in a small town from 1995 to 2002. \nApplicant has been employed as an information technology (IT) professional by a federal \ncontractor since September 2015. Applicant reports no military service, and he has held a \nsecurity clearance since 2006. (Tr. 18-20) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges under Guideline M that in 2015, Applicant violated his employer\u2019s \ninformation protection acceptable-use policy by viewing child-pornography images on his \ncompany\u2019s laptop computer. A second allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a asserts that Applicant was \nterminated from his employment on August 20, 2015, as a result. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that \nApplicant failed to disclose this derogatory information during an interview on December \n19, 2016, with an authorized investigator for DOD. SOR \u00b6 2.c cross-alleges the same \nmisconduct under SOR \u00b6 1.a and raises a concern under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nThe basis for these allegations is an August 19, 2015 letter of termination from the vice \npresident of his company (GE 4), and Applicant\u2019s answers to interrogatories dated July 31, \n2017, with an attached two-page statement clarifying the summary of his personal subject \ninterview (PSI) conducted by an authorized investigator on December 19, 2016 (GE 3).  \n \nApplicant was terminated from his employment by a previous federal contractor on \nAugust 19, 2015. (Tr. 21) He testified that he was called in by his supervisors in June 2015, \nand told that inappropriate images had been found on his work laptop computer. Applicant \nadmitted he had viewed adult pornography on this laptop. They took his laptop away and \nprovided him with another loaner laptop. (Tr. 34) Applicant was called in again on August \n19, 2015. He vehemently denied ever downloading, accessing, or viewing child \npornography-images on his work laptop computer. (Tr. 45) He did not ever see the offensive \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s June 4, 2014 security \nclearance application (SCA) (GE 1).  \n \n\n3 \n \nimages obtained by his employer, but was told that his laptop contained inappropriate \nimages. He was terminated after 13 \u00bd years with that employer, and he did not appeal. (Tr. \n45) Applicant had taken computer-security courses and training and he knew that the \ncompany prohibited viewing adult pornography on work computers. (Tr. 50, 83)  \n \nApplicant lived with his wife and four children in 2015. Local police obtained and \nexecuted a search warrant at his house in March 2016 seeking evidence of a computer \ncrime. (Tr. 36) Since the internet service provider (ISP) subscription at that address was in \nApplicant\u2019s name, he was interviewed first by the police. He vehemently denied viewing or \ndownloading child-pornography images on his laptop computer. When Applicant\u2019s 17-year-\nold stepson was interviewed separately, he admitted downloading the compressed files of \npornographic images of his minor girlfriend on his computer. (Tr. 39, AE A) The stepson \nwent to court and pled guilty to a reduced charge of computer harassment. He was \nsentenced to two years of probation and therapy, which he completed, and the conviction \nwas expunged. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant never gave anybody else his password or computer \naccess card (CAC) card to access his work laptop computer. (Tr. 43)  \n \nIn a December 19, 2016, personal subject interview (PSI), a clearance interviewer \nwent through the various sections of Applicant\u2019s June 2014 SCA and asked Applicant \nquestions. Applicant told her that he voluntarily resigned from his employment in 2015 \nbecause he did not like the contract. (Tr. 56) Applicant testified that this was a snap decision \nand he lied to her because he was embarrassed. Applicant wholeheartedly regrets this and \nthe ensuing falsifications in sections 13 (c) (employment record) and 27 (use of information \ntechnology systems) of the same SCA. (Tr. 57) Applicant was not forthcoming with the \nclearance interviewer about derogatory information in his background. Applicant testified \nthat he viewed adult pornography on his work laptop for three years starting in 2012, and \nhe last viewed adult pornography in 2015. (Tr. 77, 81)  \n \n \n \n                                     Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is \nan examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing of a number of variables of an \nindividual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the individual is an acceptable \nsecurity risk. This is known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \n \nThe Concern. Failure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness \nor ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information. \nInformation Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, or wireless \ndevice used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, protect, or move \ninformation. This includes any component, whether integrated into a larger \nsystem or not, such as hardware, software, or firmware, used to enable or \nfacilitate these operations.2 \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following pertinent disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6 40: \n \n          (e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by rules, \nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not authorized. \n                                                          \n2 AG \u00b6 39. \n\n5 \n \n \nApplicant has admitted in his response to the SOR that he improperly downloaded \npornography onto his work computer without authorization and in violation of his employer\u2019s \nIT policy. This meets the government\u2019s burden in establishing application of the above-\nmentioned disqualifying conditions, and shifts the focus to potentially mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 41(a) could potentially mitigate the use of information technology concerns: \n \nso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened    \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nApplicant viewed pornographic images on his work laptop computer for three years \nfrom 2012 to 2015. Applicant testified credibly that he has refrained from this behavior for \nalmost four years. He is contrite and he has been punished by this former employer when \nhe was terminated and unemployed for a period. However, he was not forthcoming with the \nclearance interviewer about the termination. He told her he voluntarily resigned because \nhe did not like the contract. He repeatedly violated his employer\u2019s IT policy by viewing the \npornography. Under the circumstances, I am not convinced that this violation and lapse in \njudgment won\u2019t recur in the future.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n. \n           The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nThe Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or  \n            omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator \n            security official, competent medical or mental health professional, involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility              \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n     \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \n \n         I find that the evidence and testimony presented, implicate AG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (b) and \n16 (f). Applicant acknowledges having computer training with the company and being \n\n6 \n \naware of his company\u2019s zero-tolerance policy for downloading pornography on \ncompany computers, and he admits to violating it. Moreover, Applicant was terminated \nby his employer for this behavior. He exacerbated matters by failing to disclose the truth \nabout his termination from his employer in 2015 to the clearance investigator.  \n \n \n Conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could potentially mitigate security concerns \ninclude: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nMy analysis under adjudicative guideline M above, is the same under this this \nadministrative guideline E and is herein incorporated by reference. Applicant lied to the \nclearance investigator in December 2016 about his termination. He has not been \ncandid and forthright throughout the security clearance process. Insufficient time has \npassed to conclude that his misconduct in viewing pornography and his falsifications \nto the investigator occurred under unique circumstances and are not likely to recur. \nApplicant has taken positive steps to acknowledge his mistakes, and he no longer \nviews pornography but he has not had counseling. The mitigating conditions above do \nnot apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \n\n7 \n \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines M and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Notably, Applicant has a demonstrated record of over \n20 years of service in law enforcement and as a federal contractor with a security clearance.  \nHe is a father of two children and two stepchildren. Most importantly, Applicant deliberately \ndeceived the clearance investigator about his reason for leaving employment in 2015. He \nhas not met his burden of persuasion.  \n \nThere is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant has violated the company\u2019s \nrules, regulations, policies or procedures pertaining to use of IT, and that he lied about it to \nthe investigator. He has not met his burden of persuasion. I am not convinced that these \nwere isolated incidents.

I was assigned the case on May 10, 2018.  \nA notice was issued on June 19, 2018, setting the hearing for August 23, 2018. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled, during which time the Government offered six \nexhibits (Exs.), noted as Exs. 1-6, plus two hearing exhibits (HE), accepted as HE 1-2. \nApplicant rendered testimony relevant to the case. On September 4, 2018, post-hearing \nsubmissions from Applicant were accepted into the record without objection as Exs. A-\nB. The record was then closed. In the interim, the transcript (Tr.) was received on \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n03/21/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nSeptember 4, 2018. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old mother of two children in their mid-20s. She has been \nserving as a system controller for the same defense contractor for over a year and a \nhalf. Applicant has earned an associate\u2019s degree. She served on active duty in the \nUnited States military honorably from 1989 through 1996, where she maintained a \nsecurity clearance without incident. Upon discharge, she returned to her home state \nwith plans to start college. Instead, she started to work.  \n \n \nIn 2004, friends encouraged Applicant to seek a contractor job abroad, which she \ndid. From there, she served multiple employers over the year, often in lateral moves \nrather than promotions. Her current position, accepted in 2017, was a lateral move. \nDuring this time, she enjoyed the freedom of quick trips to neighboring regions as a \ntourist. She enjoyed this life. Overtime, debt was acquired while most of her accounts \nand obligations were left to her family in the United States to manage for her. (Tr. 37). \n \n \nAt issue in the SOR are eight allegations concerning delinquent debts, 1.a-1.1.h, \nrepresenting approximately $51,000. Much of her debt delinquency dates to about \n2013, when there was an interruption of payments on her accounts despite sufficient \nincome to honor her obligations. (Tr. 37-38, 41) This while family members managed \nher bill on her behalf. Applicant admits two debts owed to a credit union (SOR allegation \n1.a-1.b) representing approximately $36,591.2 Applicant said she has made \u201ca couple\u201d \nof payments toward this debt, but provided no documentary evidence to that effect. (Tr. \n48) After the hearing, however, she provided documentation reflecting confirmation of \nprescheduled monthly payments in the amount of $200 to begin two months after the \nhearing. (Ex. A-B) No copy of the referenced agreement was attached.   \n \nThere is also one account debt owed to a collection agency for a lender Applicant \ndoes not recognize from 2016 (SOR allegation 1.c) for $4,421. She presented no \ndocumentary evidence regarding this account, although the Government\u2019s credit reports \nsuggest it may be in repayment. (Tr. 28). After the hearing, Applicant wrote that she had \nbeen in contact with this entity and worked on a repayment schedule, but provided no \ndocumentary evidence indicating any action had been taken or any documented \npayments had yet been paid.  \n \nThe majority of the delinquent debt alleged is credit card debt, but the SOR also \nreflects debts related to state taxes and medical balances. Of the medical debts (SOR \nallegations 1.d., 1.g), Applicant does not recognize the first debt, but suggests it could \nbe for care given to her daughter. She contacted her former insurer, which she has not \nused in several years, and it did not recognize her or her membership number. (Tr. 31) \n                                                          \n2 Applicant does not recall the account at 1.b, but notes family members had power of attorney and that \nshe had what he believed was a smaller second account with this entity. (Tr. 45-48) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nShe offered to pay the $218 at issue in 2017, but her offer was declined. (Tr. 29-30) She \nexperienced the same problem addressing a second medical debt for $570. \n \nThe tax liability (SOR allegations 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h) was mostly acquired due to \nmishap, as the state taxing authority had been sending Applicant notices of tax liability \nto an incorrect address for at least a year. (Tr. 23) Once discovered, Applicant had her \nfamily make the necessary address correction for her while she was abroad. Applicant \nnow manages the situation overseas via the Internet. Those debts, amounting to about \n$8,580, were satisfied in January 2017. (Ex. 6; Tr. 24) In about 2016, she received word \na garnishment had been attached to her pay. (Tr. 61) By that point, Applicant took over \nmanagement of all her debts. (Tr. 53) \n \nApplicant is presently in charge of her finances and able to honor her daily \nexpenses under a manageable budget (Tr. 58-59) One child is about to graduate from \ncollege and \u201cprobably\u201d be independent financially. (Tr. 54) Applicant\u2019s mother has since \npassed away, so there is no parental financial assistance extended by Applicant. \nApplicant has had telephonic financial counseling from abroad and is expecting to \nreceive a session in person in the near future. \n                                               \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad numerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance-related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThere are multiple delinquent debts at issue, some dating back to 2013. It \nappears her initial buildup of delinquent debt was the result of inaction by her family, to \nwhom she had entrusted the maintenance of her accounts and affairs during the many \nyears while she lived abroad. When she discovered there was a problem, she \nimmediately had them give the state tax entity her current address and began \ncontrolling the situation herself by Internet. She then assumed control of all of her \naccounts in the same way, shifting the obligation for her accounts to herself through the \never increasingly ubiquitous Internet technology. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nApplicant has received telephonic financial counseling, taken control of her state \ntax situation, and apparently tried to repay the two smaller medical accounts. She \ntestified orally that payments on the medical accounts were actively refused by the \ninsurer because they no longer had information on her or the balances. The lion\u2019s share \nof her remaining delinquent debt (approximately $37,000 of $51,000), and the related \nsecurity concerns, remain in the form of the notably large credit card balances.  \n \nApplicant apparently made arrangements to make monthly $200 payments \ntoward the debts at 1.a and 1.b, but not until well after the hearing was adjourned. No \ncopy of the underlying financial arrangement was offered. There is scant documentation \nwith regard to what she has done or plans to do with regard to the debt from 1.c. The \nsubstantial financial balances owed and the last-minute efforts regarding these debts \nare not insignificant, and they limit complete application of AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the her \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those \nfactors. I am also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to \ngrant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased on careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old system controller who has worked for the same \ncontractor for over a year and a half. She served in the military honorably on active duty \nfrom 1989 through 1996, and worked abroad as a defense contractor since about 2004. \nApplicant is the mother of two grown children. Until a few years ago, her family based in \nthe United States monitored her affairs and financial contractors on her behalf.  \n \nAt issue in this case is approximately $51,000, of which, nearly $37,000 concerns \ntwo recognized commercial credit card balances. When first aware she owed state \ndelinquent taxes that had gone unnoticed because the state did not have her most \ncurrent contact address, Applicant had her family correct the address confusion and she \n\n \n \n \n \n6\npersonally made sure the arrearage of about $8,500 was satisfied in January 2017. She \nhas also tried to pay the delinquent debts to a former medical provider amounting to \nalmost $800, but the provider is said to have refused payment because neither the \naccounts nor Applicant are in its records. No documentary evidence was provided \nconcerning what Applicant has since identified as a commercial debt of about $4,000, \nalthough she indicated she has spoken with the entity. \n \nThat leaves the approximately $37,000 owed to her former commercial credit \ncard. After the hearing, Applicant forwarded copies of paperwork showing she had \nmade arrangements for future monthly $200 payments on a referenced, but not offered, \nrepayment arrangement. While this suggests effort, no complete documentation has \nbeen offered to show a full repayment package has been finalized and implemented, \nnor is there evidence that such action was commenced before the SOR was issued.  \n \nThis process does not demand that an applicant pay all of one\u2019s delinquent \ndebts. It does, however, expect an applicant to describe a workable and manageable \nagreement and demonstrate by documentary evidence that a meaningful track record of \ntimely and notable payment has been established. Here, with regard to the \noverwhelming majority of the delinquent debt at issue, Applicant simply waited too late \nto enact the appropriate steps to provide documentation that the brunt of her debt has \nbeen brought under control. In light of the above, I find that at this time, Applicant\u2019s \nefforts and documentation fail to mitigate financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

She was sentenced to 180 days in jail, \nwith 178 days suspended; probation for 12 months; 48 hours of community service; and \na fine. Applicant does not believe she was too drunk to drive. She asserted that she \nonly had one beer. She admitted it was a large beer of about 32 ounces. She stated that \nher blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .04%. (Tr. at 20-22, 43-47; GE 2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in June 2015 and charged with disorderly conduct and \ntrespassing on private property. She paid a fine, and was ordered to complete \ncommunity service. The charges were then nolle prosequi (dismissed). She stated that \nshe and a friend were in a bar in a resort town. Her friend became extremely intoxicated \nand was yelling and screaming. The hotel they were staying at attempted to kick them \nout. They were subsequently arrested. (Tr. at 20, 47-49; GE 2, 3) \n \nAlcohol played a significant role in Applicant\u2019s criminal record. She stated that \nshe rarely drinks anymore, and then only in moderation. She has not been arrested or \ncharged with anything since the June 2015 arrest. Applicant moved to her current \nlocation in 2014 to live with her son who is in the military. He has been a positive \ninfluence on her, and she no longer associates with a bad crowd. He has noticed a \nchange in her and believes that she is honest, loyal, and not a threat to national \nsecurity. (Tr. at 28-29, 49, 58-62; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nApril 2016. She reported her 2011 DUI and her 2015 arrest for disturbing the peace \n(disorderly conduct). She denied any involvement with illegal drugs in the previous \nseven years. Applicant told the background investigator that it was unintentional, and \nshe must have misread the question. She testified that she did not list her marijuana \nuse because she \u201cwasn\u2019t a big-time marijuana smoker. It was an occasional thing, and \n[she] didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal.\u201d She also indicated that she is \u201cnot good with \nwords . . . . [She] didn\u2019t leave it out on purpose. [She] just didn\u2019t know how to word it.\u201d \n(Tr. at 25-27; GE 1) \n \nThe SOR alleges two defaulted student loans and a $370 delinquent medical \ndebt. Applicant rehabilitated the student loans, and they are in good standing. She was \njointly responsible for her ex-husband\u2019s medical debt. He was supposed to pay it. It is \nnot reflected on the two most recent credit reports in evidence. (Tr. at 33-34; GE 4-6) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \n\n \n4 \n \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n5 \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nApplicant provided inconsistent explanations for why she did not report her \nmarijuana use on her SF 86. She was not a credible witness. I find that she intentionally \nprovided false information about her marijuana use on the SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is \napplicable.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant discussed her marijuana use with the background investigator in \nSeptember 2016 and again in May 2017. She then provided completely different \n\n \n6 \n \naccounts in her response to the SOR and during her testimony. I am unable to conclude \nthat Applicant now understands the importance of truthfulness in the security clearance \nprocess. There are no applicable mitigating conditions.  \n \nGuidelines H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nAll of the Guidelines H allegations are cross-alleged under Guidelines J. The two \nguidelines will be discussed together. The security concerns for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and criminal conduct are set out in AG \u00b6\u00b6 24 and 30:       \n \n24. The Concern. The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the \nmisuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n30. The Concern. Criminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and \nregulations. \n \n \nApplicant has multiple arrests and convictions, including a conviction for \npossession of a controlled substance. She used marijuana for many years. The \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under Guidelines H and J are established: \n \n25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n \n31(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26 and 32 describe conditions that could mitigate drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and criminal conduct security concerns. The following are potentially \napplicable: \n \n26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility;  \n \n32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or \nit happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n32(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant was either convicted or admitted culpability for all the arrests, with the \nexception of the 2006 arrest for injury to property (SOR \u00b6 1.c). I conclude SOR \u00b6 1.c for \nApplicant. \n \n \nThere is no evidence of marijuana use after 2014 or arrests after June 2015. I \nbelieve Applicant\u2019s son is a positive influence on her. Nonetheless, I still have significant \nconcerns, primarily related to her credibility. As discussed above, Applicant intentionally \nprovided false information throughout this process. I am unable to determine that \nadditional drug abuse or criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The \n\n \n8 \n \nabove mitigating factors, individually or collectively, are insufficient to dispel the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse and criminal conduct security concerns.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant rehabilitated the student loans, and they are in good standing. She \nwas jointly responsible for her ex-husband\u2019s medical debt. He was supposed to pay it. It \nis not reflected on the two most recent credit reports in evidence. Concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, F, H, and J in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations), but she did \nnot mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct), H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse), and J (criminal conduct).  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to him by the Defense Department in 2006. He has worked as an engineer technician for a company in the defense industry since about 2005. His formal education includes some college in 2008. His employment history does not include military service. His first marriage ended in divorce in 2006. He married his current spouse in 2010. He has an adult child from a previous relationship, a minor child from his first marriage, and two minor stepchildren from his current marriage. The three minor children live with Applicant and his spouse. His spouse is employed outside the home as a human-resources manager for a private company. Applicant has a history of involvement with marijuana going back to the early 1990s, which he does not dispute. The SOR is concerned about three particular incidents in 1992, 1995, and 2017. Each is discussed below. Applicant was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, a marijuana pipe or bong, in March 1992. The arrest stemmed from a police investigation of a domestic disturbance at the home where Applicant was living at the time.

He did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate his \ninvolvement with marijuana. The most recent incident occurred in January 2017, when \nhe knowingly used marijuana at a New Year\u2019s Day party while holding a security \nclearance. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format) on June 15, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as a \nsecurity clearance application. Thereafter, on July 28, 2017, after reviewing the \napplication and the information gathered during a background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent \nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was \n                                                          \n1 Exhibit 1.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guidelines known as Guideline H for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and Guideline E for personal conduct. The sole allegation under \nGuideline E is simply a cross-allegation of the matters alleged under Guideline H.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 16, 2017. He admitted the SOR \nallegations under Guideline H while not addressing the Guideline E allegation. He \nprovided brief explanations for his admissions. And he requested an in-person hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.   \n \nThe case was assigned to me on December 13, 2017. The hearing was \nconducted as scheduled on April 19, 2018. Both Department Counsel and Applicant \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Government Exhibits 1-4 and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A-Q. The record closed on April 23, 2018, when Applicant \nsubmitted a post-hearing exhibit, which was admitted without objections as Exhibit R. \nThe hearing transcript was received on May 3, 2018.   \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \npreviously granted to him by the Defense Department in 2006. He has worked as an \nengineer technician for a company in the defense industry since about 2005. His formal \neducation includes some college in 2008. His employment history does not include \nmilitary service. His first marriage ended in divorce in 2006. He married his current \nspouse in 2010. He has an adult child from a previous relationship, a minor child from \nhis first marriage, and two minor stepchildren from his current marriage. The three minor \nchildren live with Applicant and his spouse. His spouse is employed outside the home \nas a human-resources manager for a private company.  \n  \nApplicant has a history of involvement with marijuana going back to the early \n1990s, which he does not dispute. The SOR is concerned about three particular \nincidents in 1992, 1995, and 2017. Each is discussed below. \n \nApplicant was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, a marijuana pipe or \nbong, in March 1992. The arrest stemmed from a police investigation of a domestic \ndisturbance at the home where Applicant was living at the time. The county attorney \ndeclined to prosecute the case due to possible problems with the search, resulting in \ninsufficient evidence to ensure a reasonable likelihood of conviction.2 \n \nApplicant was arrested about three years later in June 1995 for the misdemeanor \noffenses of possession of marijuana and driving on a suspended license.3 At the time, \n                                                          \n2 Exhibit A.  \n \n3 Exhibit B.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nhe was using marijuana once or twice a week.4 His arrest stemmed from a traffic stop \ndue to an expired registration. The vehicle was searched and a small amount of \nmarijuana in a container was discovered. He subsequently pleaded guilty and the court \nimposed a fine, which he was supposed to pay over time. He failed to make timely \npayment and ended up serving about 40 days in jail in lieu of the fine.5 \n \nThe third incident occurred on January 1, 2017, when he smoke marijuana (three \nto four puffs off a joint) while attending a New Year\u2019s Day party unaccompanied by his \nspouse.6 He tested positive for marijuana on a random drug screening test on January \n26, 2017. His employer was notified of the positive test on January 31, 2017, and he \nwas suspended without pay. He had not reported the marijuana use before the positive \ndrug test result. Subsequently, his employer decided that his continued employment \nwas contingent upon successful completion of an approved substance-abuse program \nand a negative drug test result. He completed the approved substance-abuse program \nwith no further services recommended on March 23, 2017. He had drug testing on \nMarch 27, 2017, which produced a negative test result, and he returned to work the \nfollowing day under a last-chance agreement with his employer.7 \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant attributed his January 2017 marijuana use to a lapse in \ngood judgment.8 He described the incident as \u201ca weak, stupid moment,\u201d \u201ca stupid move \non [his] part,\u201d and he deeply regrets it.9 He stated that he had not used marijuana since \nhis arrest in 1995.10 He has no intention of using marijuana or any other illegal drug in \nthe future. He submitted a signed statement of intent setting forth his intention to abstain \nfrom all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.11   \n \nIn addition to the signed statement of intent, Applicant submitted a number of \ndocuments in support of his case.12 The documents include highly favorable letters of \nrecommendation from two co-workers as well as a letter of reference from the senior \nminister of his church.13 He submitted proof of his attendance at multiple sessions of \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 45.  \n \n5 Tr. 44-45.  \n \n6 Exhibits 2, G, and I; Tr. 37-40.  \n \n7 Tr. 57-58.  \n \n8 Tr. 47-48.  \n \n9 Tr. 39-40.  \n \n10 Tr. 45.  \n \n11 Exhibit R.  \n \n12 Exhibits C \u2013 Q.  \n \n13 Exhibits C, D, and E.  \n\n \n4 \n \nNarcotics Anonymous (NA). And he submitted multiple documents as evidence of his \ngood employment record and job-related training.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.14 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.15 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d16 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.17 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.18 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.19 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.20 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.21 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.22 An \n14 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n15 Department of the Navy v.

In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.  \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance abuse; \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; \n                                                          \n23 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n24 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n25 AG \u00b6 24.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana, which \nincludes two arrests, one conviction resulting in some jail time, and the recent January \n2017 marijuana use while holding a security clearance. Indeed, his January 2017 \nmarijuana use was about six months after he submitted his June 2016 security \nclearance application. Any illegal drug use is relevant in the context of evaluating a \nperson\u2019s security worthiness, but it is particularly egregious if it occurs while granted \naccess to classified information. Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana during the early \n1990s is easily mitigated as youthful indiscretions that are common among some people \nin their early 20s. The fact that he was granted a security clearance in 2006 bears this \npoint out. The same cannot be said for his marijuana use in January 2017 as a working \nengineer technician for a company in the defense industry. More is expected given his \nage and maturity in January 2017. And Applicant should have known better in light of \nhis decade of employment with a defense contractor while holding a security clearance \nand being subject to random drug tests.  \n \n \nApplicant presented a good case in reform and rehabilitation. It is apparent that \nhe now understands the seriousness of his January 2017 marijuana use while holding a \nsecurity clearance. Nonetheless, I am not persuaded that he is an acceptable security \nrisk. I reached that conclusion for a couple of reasons. First, his January 2017 \nmarijuana use was clearly forbidden conduct that he chose to engage in despite \nknowing the potential negative consequences. In addition to being a serious lapse in \ngood judgment, his marijuana use demonstrated a willingness to engage in high-risk \nbehavior, which does not make him a good candidate for a security clearance. Second, \nI doubt Applicant\u2019s January 2017 marijuana use would have come to light but for the \nrandom drug test. He did not report his January 2017 marijuana use to his employer, \nbut instead hoped to avoid detection by having the substance pass through his system \nbefore the next random drug test. His reluctance to voluntarily self-report such adverse \ninformation further undermines his suitability for a security clearance.  \n    \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \n\n \n7 \n \nevidence or vice versa. In particular, I considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s employer \nelected to continue his employment after his January 2017 marijuana use. I also \nconsidered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has not met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant26  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \n \nMichael H.

His drug use has been mitigated. Based on a review of the pleadings, testimony, \nand exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on November 28, 2016. (Government Exhibit 1.) On July 25, 2017, the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and H (Drug Involvement). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on or after June 8, 2017.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on August 14, 2017, with \nattachments and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on December 22, 2017. The case was assigned to me \non January 4, 2018. Due to a family medical emergency the case was reassigned to \nanother administrative judge on January 25, 2018. The case was reassigned to me on \nMarch 20, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice \nof Hearing on March 20, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 3, 2018. The \nGovernment offered Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A, B, D, \nE, H, K, L, and M. There are no Applicant Exhibits C, F, G, I, or J. Applicant\u2019s exhibits \nwere also admitted without objection. Applicant requested the record remain open for \nsubmission of additional exhibits. He submitted Applicant Exhibits N and O, which were \nalso admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May \n11, 2018.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old software engineer. He is married to his second wife, and \nhas a Bachelor of Science degree. He is seeking to obtain national security eligibility for \na security clearance in connection with his work with the DoD.  \n \nApplicant has severe physical issues that have resulted in periods where he \nreceived disability while recovering. He was basically unemployed between 2005 and \n2011 due to his physical issues. During that time he attended college. Applicant worked \nfull time from 2013 to 2015, when he again went on disability. He was unemployed for \nabout a year before obtaining work with his current employer in October 2016. He \nreturned to disability in August 2017, and was on disability at the time of the hearing. He \nreturned to work in June 2018. When on disability Applicant makes about 60% of his \nsalary. Applicant contends his physical problems have caused the majority of his financial \nissues.

(See Government Exhibit 1 at Section 26.) \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admitted filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004. The debts included \nan automobile loan, medical bills, and student loans. Applicant received a discharge in \nbankruptcy on February 14, 2005. Given the length of time since Applicant filed this \nbankruptcy, I find that it has no current security significance and this allegation is found \nfor Applicant. (Government Exhibit 3; Tr. 19, 30-31.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant denied he was indebted for past-due child support in the amount of \n$5,369.

(Tr. 45, 66.) \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted all three allegations under this \nparagraph.  \n \n \n2.a and 2.b. Applicant purchased marijuana once, and used it several times during \na single month in 2013. At that time Applicant was in severe pain from his knee and back, \nand prescription painkillers were not working for him. He used marijuana between two \nand four times during that period. The marijuana did nothing for his pain, so he stopped \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nusing it. (Government Exhibits 1 at Section 23, and 2; Applicant Exhibit K; Tr. 24-25, 52-\n58.) \n \n \n2.c. Applicant began having seizures in 2015. He did research that indicated \ningesting marijuana or pills that contained tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active \ningredient in marijuana, would possibly help stop the seizures. At that time he consumed \nseveral THC pills that were prescribed for someone else. The pills were unsuccessful in \nstopping his seizures, so he stopped using them. (Government Exhibits 1 at Section 23, \nand 2; Applicant Exhibit K; Tr. 25, 58-62.) \n \n \nApplicant had not used illegal drugs since 2015 and has no intention of using illegal \ndrugs in the future. As of the date of the hearing he was not taking any pain medication, \nor other medication. (Tr. 60-63.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations)  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant, based on the evidence, had 24 delinquent accounts that he could not or \nchose not to resolve. These debts have been in existence for a considerable period of \ntime. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThe evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case, with several exceptions. As stated, subparagraphs 1.a, b, c, and r are \nfound for Applicant. With regard to AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant has had a long history of medical \nailments that have obviously affected his finances in a detrimental way. However, there \nis little evidence that Applicant has acted responsibly to try and resolve his debts. He still \nowes a considerable amount of money, and has no plan about how to pay it off. Applicant \ndid not even pay the smallest debts, for $18 and $25. He failed to submit evidence that \nwould tend to support any of the other mitigating conditions. There is no basis for me to \nfind that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation. \nParagraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \n \n \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana for a brief time in 2013. He used THC \npills for a brief time in 2015. Both of the stated disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant has had severe pain issues, and a history of seizures. The drug use was \na misguided attempt by him to resolve those medical issues after other treatment had \nfailed. The use of marijuana and THC pills was unsuccessful, Applicant realized it and \nstopped the conduct, and credibly stated he would not use illegal drugs again in the future. \nApplicant has mitigated the security significance of his past drug use. Paragraph 2 is \nfound for Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concern caused by his significant financial difficulties. Overall, the record \nevidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline J, \ncriminal conduct, because he did not provide sufficient evidence that his alcohol-related \noffenses are unlikely to recur. Eligibility for continued access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 26, 2015. On \nJanuary 23, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant alleging security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, \nand Guideline J, criminal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n01/09/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 21, 2018, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was initially assigned to another administrative judge on April 18, 2018, and \nwas assigned to me on July 23, 2018. On July 27, 2018, a notice of hearing was issued, \nscheduling the case for August 22, 2018.  \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without objection. I left \nthe record open to provide him the opportunity to submit additional evidence.1 He timely \nsubmitted 11 additional exhibits, which were marked and admitted without objection as \nAE 1 through 11 (as Applicant had listed them).2 DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on August 30, 2018. The record closed on September 12, 2018.  \n \nAmendments to the SOR \n \n \nAt the start of the hearing, I amended the SOR to correct two grammatical errors, \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.b. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b were also amended during the hearing to \nconform to the record evidence, reflecting the dates of Applicant\u2019s arrests, instead of the \ncourt dates. The amendments were accepted without objection.

(Tr. 123-124, 129-131) Department Counsel provided a copy of the page after the hearing, and it \nis included in GE 2.  \n \n2 AE A is a recommendation letter. AE 1 is a September 2015 letter regarding Applicant\u2019s completion of \nthe conditions of community supervision after his 2014 offense. AE 2 is a work award. AE 3 and AE 4 are \nmedical records from Applicant\u2019s August 30, 2018 session with his doctor. AE 5 is a December 6, 2016 \nletter from Applicant\u2019s counsel in a legal matter with his wife.

Since 1998, he has worked as a defense \ncontractor, either for his current employer or its predecessor. He works as a systems \nengineer and program manager. He has held a security clearance since his time in the \nNavy, and needs a clearance for his job. (Tr. 31, 35-37; GE 1; AE 6-AE 11) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife married in 1994. They have two daughters, ages 20 and \n21. Both are now in college. He also has a 28-year-old stepson, his wife\u2019s son from a \nprior relationship. Applicant and his wife have had several separations. They first \nseparated in 2005. They reconciled in 2007, but his wife then spent the next four years \nin jail after her fourth conviction for driving under the influence (DUI) or driving while \nintoxicated (DWI). (Tr. 34, 67) She returned to the home in 2011 after her release. She \nmoved out of the house again in November 2014, and was away for about the next \nyear. Applicant and his wife separated again in about June 2016. He later retained legal \ncounsel and considered divorce. (AE 5; Tr. 92) They remained separated at the time of \nApplicant\u2019s background interview, in February 2017. (GE 3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife returned to the home in December 2017, though she moved out \nagain in January 2018. It is unclear when she returned, but at the time of the hearing, \nthey remained legally married and were living under the same roof, though maintaining \nseparate lives. Applicant said they do not speak, and do not have arguments. \u201cI don\u2019t \nknow what there would be to fight about,\u201d he said. Applicant is the household\u2019s sole \nfinancial provider, and he pays the mortgage. (Tr. 31-39, 89-93; GE 1) \n \n \nIn August 2012, Applicant had an altercation with his stepson, then age 22, over \nhis compliance with house rules. Applicant had consumed several beers over several \nhours while watching an early-season college football game at home. During the \naltercation, his wife called the police, and Applicant was arrested and charged with \nassault and battery of his stepson. (Tr. 40-46, 83-84; GE 1; GE 3) In about October \n2012, Applicant went to court and pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to one year of \nprobation, and ordered to attend anger-management classes. He completed the terms \nof his sentence. (Tr. 47-48, 83; GE 1 at 26-27; GE 3 at 3; Answer) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \n \n \nIn December 2013, Applicant had an altercation with his wife. Both of them had \nbeen drinking. Applicant testified that his wife had a habit of stealing his wallet and keys, \nand he believed she had done so on this occasion. He grabbed her wrists and pulled \nher up off the couch in an effort to get her to help him look for his wallet. They lost their \nbalance and fell over, and his wife hit her head, though she was not injured. Applicant \nhad consumed between two and four beers, and said he was \u201cbuzzed\u201d but not \nintoxicated. No one was arrested at the time. (Tr. 48-53, 86-87; GE 3 at 4) \n \n \nA few months later, in February 2014, Applicant\u2019s wife and their elder daughter, \nthen 17, had an altercation, in which his daughter threw a coffee mug at her mother, \nhitting her in the face. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law was visiting at the time, and he called \npolice. The daughter was arrested and spent the night in juvenile detention. (GE 3 at 4; \nTr. 67-70, 85-86) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife then told the police about the December 2013 altercation with \nher husband. Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic assault upon his wife. \nHe spent the night in jail. (Tr. 53, 84-87; GE 1 at 27-29; GE 3 at 4) (SOR \u00b6 2.b) In June \n2014, Applicant pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to two years of probation and \nordered to attend 12 weeks of alcohol education and domestic-violence training. (Tr. 49-\n53, 87; GE 1 at 27-29; GE 3 at 4)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two daughters were referred to therapy through his employer\u2019s \nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP). Through Applicant\u2019s own involvement, he was \nreferred to mental-health and substance-abuse counseling.3 (Tr. 57-59, 99-100; GE 2 at \n5) \n \n \nAt his initial evaluation in May 2014, Applicant reported that he began drinking at \nage 16. His drinking had increased gradually over the previous seven years (beginning \nin 2007, the year his first separation ended, and the year his wife went to jail). During \nthat time, his longest period of abstinence was four days. (GE 2 at 42) Applicant self-\nreported that he drank about five nights a week, usually by himself. He would have two \nor three shots of liquor on weekdays (including the night before the evaluation), and four \nto six shots on weekend nights. He reported some history of \u201cshakes, queasy stomach, \nnight sweats, and anxiety the next day after drinking heavily,\u201d as well as likely partial \nblackouts. He recognized \u201cthat drinking has become a problem with his becoming \ndependent on it.\u201d He expressed a desire to cut back on his drinking though he had not \nbeen able to do so. (GE 2 at 41)  \n \n \nApplicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and depressive disorder not \notherwise specified (NOS) by a Ph.D. licensed clinical psychologist. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) The \npsychologist recommended that Applicant participate in an intensive outpatient \nchemical-dependency program. (GE 2 at 39, 42) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s treatment plan included drug and alcohol abstinence, participation in \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA), and development of an effective social-support network \nand of coping strategies for dealing with stress. Documentation reflects that Applicant \nwas briefed verbally on the treatment program: (\u201cI have gone over this plan with \n[Applicant]\u201d and he \u201cverbally agrees to treatment plan.\u201d) (GE 2 at 43) \n \n \nApplicant began the intensive outpatient group treatment program on June 16, \n2014. (GE 2 at 35) He missed a week of group sessions in late July 2014 after he \nrelapsed into binge drinking. (GE 2 at 23-38) When he returned to the program, he \ncontinued attendance and completed the required 18 sessions on August 11, 2014. (AE \n1) He attended AA during the program. (GE 2 at 7, 14) His prognosis in mid-August \n2014 was \u201cpoor to guarded.\u201d (GE 2 at 16, 17) There is no record evidence of a \nsubsequent prognosis. \n \n                                                          \n3 GE 2 is a 43-page exhibit consisting of treatment records from both the psychology provider and the \nintensive outpatient substance abuse counseling provider.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant returned for individual therapy with EAP in late September 2014. He \nreported that during the intensive outpatient group treatment, his longest period of \nsobriety was about three weeks. He resumed drinking shortly after completing that \nprogram. In late August 2014, Applicant\u2019s son-in-law moved back into the home. \nApplicant and his wife coped with the resulting stress by drinking, despite what he \nindicated was a court order not to do so. It was recommended that he develop a more \nextensive recovery plan with AA and that he identify how to achieve longer-term \nsobriety. (Tr. 68-75; GE 2 at 14)  \n \n \nAt the time, Applicant\u2019s daughters had been removed from the home by Child \nProtective Services (CPS), in August 2014, and an October 2014 court date was \npending. As part of his efforts to get them released by CPS and back into his custody, \nApplicant requested and received a prescription for Campral to help with his alcohol \ncravings, because, he said, he wanted to do more than what was required. (Tr. 66, 76-\n77; GE 2 at 13)  \n \n \nApplicant continued therapy with the EAP psychologist through late 2014. He \nwas sober for several months. He reported to his providers that the Campral was \nworking and that he found AA useful. (GE 2 at 7) In order for Applicant\u2019s daughters to \nreturn home from CPS custody, his wife had to leave the home, which she did, in \nNovember 2014. She was out of the home for the next year. (Tr. 68-75) Applicant\u2019s last \ndocumented therapy session with EAP was in November 2014. (GE 2 at 1)  \n \n \nApplicant completed a parenting class in December 2014. He completed a \nbatterer\u2019s intervention program between March and July 2015. He tested negative for \nalcohol on August 27, 2015. A September 9, 2015 letter from community supervision \nauthorities documented that he completed the requirements of his probation. (AE 1) He \nsaid he had been given drug and alcohol tests during his probation. (Tr. 54-63) \nApplicant completed his two-year probation period in June 2016. He has had no \nsubsequent arrests or criminal offenses. (Tr. 88)  \n \n \nApplicant had a background interview in February 2017 in connection with his \nSCA. He reported consuming alcohol three or four times a week. He reported \nconsuming two beers when in public, and up to eight beers at home. As to hard liquor, \nhe reported consuming one to two cocktails in public, and three shots and four cocktails \n\u201cif he is trying to get loose and have fun.\u201d He said he drank three shots and four \ncocktails, or eight beers, about twice a month \u201cto get buzzed.\u201d He said this had been his \ndrinking pattern intake for the previous 10 years. He drank more when he was younger. \n(GE 3 at 5) This alcohol consumption is alleged as a security concern, as it post-dates \nhis diagnosis of alcohol dependence, in 2014. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b) \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted his offenses, accepted \nresponsibility for his conduct, and expressed regret. He said he had been in a \u201ctoxic \nrelationship.\u201d He said he had completed the required treatment plan and all probationary \nrequirements for both of his offenses. He disputed that he had been diagnosed with \nalcohol dependence. (Answer) \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that he drinks three or four times a week. \nSometimes he drinks cocktails or two or three shots of alcohol, and sometimes he \ndrinks \u201cno more than two\u201d bottles of beer when out with others. He denied that he drinks \nto excess. (Tr. 108-109)  \n \n  \n \nApplicant testified that prior to this hearing, he had not seen documentation that \nhe had been diagnosed as alcohol dependent, and that his diagnosis had never been \ndiscussed with him during his treatment. (Tr. 62-64, 88, 101). As he did in his Answer, \nApplicant repeatedly testified that he had never been diagnosed with alcohol \ndependence, and that he disagreed with the diagnosis. Applicant said, \u201cI don\u2019t agree \nwith the statement that I\u2019m alcohol dependent;\u201d (Tr. 76) and \u201cI don\u2019t consider [myself] - I \nmean, alcohol dependent, I just don\u2019t agree with it.\u201d (Tr. 79; 80, 113)  \n \n \nTreatment records reflect that Applicant\u2019s EAP psychologist diagnosed him with \nalcohol dependence in May 2014 and that Applicant was verbally briefed on his \ntreatment plan and agreed to it. (GE 2 at 43) His treatment records do not indicate that \nApplicant was expressly told he was alcohol dependent.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that no medical doctor or licensed clinical social worker \n(LCSW) ever told him he was an alcoholic or that he had a drinking problem. (Tr. 102, \n111) He acknowledged that he would have been told or advised to stop drinking as part \nof the intensive outpatient program: \u201cI may have been. I mean, that\u2019s their goal. . . . I \nwould say as part of the program, yeah.\u201d (Tr. 65; 76, 103)  \n \n  \nApplicant has not seen any other treatment provider for substance abuse other \nthat what is reflected in GE 2. (Tr. 77, 110) He does not currently see a therapist or \nalcohol counselor. He does not believe he has a drinking problem. (Tr. 77-78, 80) He \noffered no evidence that he is currently participating in AA or any similar counseling \ngroup, nor did he indicate involvement with a support network to help him curtail his \ndrinking. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he and his wife have a history of confrontations, all \nof which involve alcohol: \u201c[Applicant] reports infrequent physical fights with his wife, with \nthe drinking having always been involved when they have occurred.\u201d (GE 2 at 2; Tr. 81) \nHe recognizes that his wife has a problem with alcohol, given her history of DUIs and \nDWIs. (Tr. 81-82) Applicant expressed regret for his actions, and accepted responsibility \nfor them. (Answer; Tr. 65, 113-114) \n \n \nApplicant provided no documentation at the hearing to refute or to update the \n2014 diagnosis of alcohol dependence. (Tr. 81) After the hearing, he provided \ndocumentation from his primary care physician, whom he visited on August 30, 2018. \nHis provider noted that Applicant \u201chad ETOH [alcohol] issues a few years ago\u201d and that \nhe was \u201cnow fighting to have his legal/employment status returned to normal.\u201d Among \nthe \u201cdiagnoses attached to this encounter\u201d was a diagnosis of Alcoholism. Applicant\u2019s \nprovider \u201cadvised counseling to resolve legal/alcohol issues.\u201d (AE 3, AE 4) The \ndocumentation does not include an updated diagnosis of Applicant\u2019s alcohol use \ndisorder, nor does it note any prognosis for the future.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant oversees a contract supporting communication networks for Navy \nships. He has had no reportable security incidents. References attest that he carries \nhimself with dignity and takes great pride in his work. He is regarded as highly valued by \nhis government customers, and has the trust and confidence of those who rely on him. \nHis references recommend retention of his clearance. (AE A; AE 2; AE 6 \u2013 AE 11)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.4 As the \nSupreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d5 \n \n \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n4 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to \na security clearance\u201d).  \n \n5 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n \n8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist; psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) or alcohol use disorder;  \n \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n \n(f) alcohol consumption which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \n \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes that Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol \ndependence in May 2014 by a Ph.D. clinical psychologist. By his own admission, \nApplicant also requested and received a prescription for Campral to ease his alcohol \ncravings in October 2014, evidence which supports such a diagnosis. AG \u00b6 22(d) \napplies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant also engaged in habitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol. AG \u00b6 22(c) applies.  \n \n \nThe record evidence does not establish that Applicant was told he was alcohol \ndependent. However, treatment records reflect that Applicant\u2019s EAP psychologist \ndiagnosed Applicant with alcohol dependence in May 2014, and that Applicant was \nverbally briefed on his treatment plan and agreed to it. Applicant\u2019s treatment plan \nincluded abstinence from alcohol and participation in AA. Applicant participated in AA \nduring 2014, but had difficulty abstaining from alcohol.  \n \n \nThe longest Applicant was able to abstain during intensive treatment was about \nthree weeks. He engaged in binge drinking in July 2014, and missed a week of \ntreatment. He resumed drinking shortly after completing his mandatory 18 sessions of \ntreatment, in August 2014, when his stepson returned home. He resumed drinking after \nhe completed probation in June 2016. He was consuming alcohol several times a week \nat the time of his background interview (February 2017) and also at the time of the \nhearing (August 2018). I conclude that Applicant\u2019s subsequent consumption of alcohol, \n\n \n9 \n \nafter he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, satisfies AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n22(e) and 22(f).  \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations.  \n \n \nThe documentation Applicant provided from his primary care physician is \ninsufficient to rebut or mitigate the diagnosis of alcohol dependence. AE 4 in fact \nreferences a prior diagnosis of alcoholism. The statement that Applicant \u201chad ETOH \nissues a few years ago,\u201d without further detail, is insufficient evidence to establish that \nApplicant\u2019s issues with alcohol are fully resolved. Indeed, Applicant\u2019s doctor \u201cadvised \ncounseling to resolve legal/alcohol issues,\u201d (emphasis added) leading to the conclusion \nthat Applicant\u2019s alcohol issues are ongoing and are not resolved or fully in the past. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) do not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant is not in alcohol treatment currently (and he relapsed during treatment \nin 2014). AG \u00b6 23(c) does not apply. Despite the relapse, Applicant did complete the \nintensive outpatient group treatment in summer 2014. However, he has not \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations. AG \u00b6 23(d) does not apply. Applicant did \nnot provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the alcohol involvement security concerns.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \n \n\n \n10 \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s two domestic violence offenses satisfy the following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 31:  \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable, under AG \u00b6 32:   \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two domestic violence offenses occurred in August 2012 and \nDecember 2013, respectively. He completed probation successfully and there is no \nevidence of subsequent offenses. These offenses are not recent. Applicant also has an \nexcellent employment record.  \n \n \nHowever, AG \u00b6 32(d) only partially applies, because Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation. This is chiefly because Applicant did not \nestablish that his offenses are unlikely to recur. Applicant and his wife maintain separate \nlives, but they remain married and living under the same roof. Applicant acknowledged \nthat he and his wife have a history of confrontations, and they are always alcohol-\nrelated. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, while dated, is clearly intertwined with his alcohol \ninvolvement. And his alcohol issues are unresolved and remain a security risk. Given \nthis evidence, I cannot conclude Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is unlikely to recur and no \nlonger casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 32(a) does \nnot apply. Applicant did not meet his burden to establish that the criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns are mitigated.  \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G and Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. I must also consider the total \npattern of Applicant\u2019s behavior, not just in a piecemeal fashion as a series of unrelated \nincidents.6 In this regard, I can and do consider the fact that Applicant\u2019s offenses are \nalcohol-related, even though they were not alleged under Guideline G.7 \n \nApplicant is still drinking frequently, despite a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. \nThe documentation he submitted post-hearing from his doctor is not sufficient evidence \nto establish that his diagnosis no longer applies. I credit Applicant with accepting \nresponsibility for his offenses. He is credited with taking steps to return his daughters to \nhome, and he remains in a difficult family situation. However, he has not established a \nsupport network for dealing with his alcohol issues. He is not in AA or a similar \ncounseling program. He still consumes alcohol several times a week, despite a \ntreatment recommendation that he should abstain. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate security concerns under either guideline alleged. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s continued \neligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n6 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-22563 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (regarding the need to avoid a \npiecemeal analysis). \n \n7 Applicant\u2019s offenses were not alleged as being alcohol-related under Guideline G. However, I can \nconsider that evidence under the whole-person concept. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006). \n\n \n12 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n________________________ \nBraden M.

Eligibility for access to classified information\nis denied.\nHistory of Case\nOn March 2, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudication\nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOD\nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge to determine whether a security  clearance should be granted, continued, denied,\nor revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security\nExecutive Agent, Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4), dated\nDecember 10, 2016, effective June 8, 2017.\n04/16/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 14, 2018, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on February 19, 2019, and was scheduled for hearing on April\nFebruary 14, 2019. At the scheduled hearing, the Government's case consisted of six\nexhibits (GEs 1-6) that were admitted without objection; Applicant relied on one witness\n(himself) and six exhibit (AEs A-F) that were admitted without objection. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on February 26, 2018.   \nBesides its six exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of certain\nfacts pertaining to Afghanistan. Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of\nnotice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd.\nApril 12, 2007). Administrative notice is appropriate for noticing facts or government\nreports that are well known. See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co.\n2006).  \nThere being no objection, and for good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the requested facts and incorporated source documents\naddressing the geopolitical situation in Afghanistan. The Government\u2019s administrative\nnotice and incorporated source documents were received as HE 1. Administrative notice\nwas extended to the requested facts and incorporated source documents consistent with\nthe provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid. This notice did not foreclose Applicant from\nchallenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports\naddressing the current status of Afghanistan. \nIn addition to taking official notice of the facts and source documents covered by\nthe Administrative Notice Request, I took official notice, sua sponte, of Background Note:\nAfghanistan, U.S. Department of State (November 2011) This document contains\npertinent background information covering Afghanistan. This document was received as\nHE 2.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with endorsements and payment\ndocumentation of several of his SOR-listed delinquent debts. For good cause shown,\nApplicant was granted 30 days to supplement the record, and the Government was\nafforded three days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant provided emailed\nendorsements, payment documentation, and updates of his creditor contacts. Applicant\u2019s\nsubmissions were admitted without objection as AEs G-M.   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 13 delinquent debts\nexceeding $11,500. Allegedly, these debts remain outstanding and unresolved. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly was terminated from two prior places of\nemployment as the result of claimed violations of (a) company policies covering\ncomplaints of unwanted sexual advances and (b) of company policies related to\nsocializing with a visitor. \n2\n\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly has family members (parents, brothers,\nand a mother-in-law) who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations with\nexplanations. He denied being terminated from prior employment positions. He claimed\nhe was set up in connection with his alleged termination from Company A, and he denied\never socializing with a visitor in connection with his alleged termination from Company B. \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year old administrative assistant for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant was born and raised in Afghanistan to parents of Afghan descent.

He reported brief periods of unemployment in 2016\nfollowing his terminations by Company A in July 2015 and more recently by Company B\nin March 2016. (GEs 1-2) Between 2008 and July 2015, he worked for different non-\ndefense employers in various jobs (some full-time and some part-time) and reported\ninterspersed periods of unemployment. (GEs 1-2)\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Applicant worked as a linguist for the U.S. Army and\ndiplomatic services in Afghanistan. (GEs 1-3 and AEs E and K; Tr. 38-39, 46-47) He is\nfluent in both Hindi and Urdu and is interested in pursuing translation opportunities with\nthe U.S. Army in the future. (Tr. 39, 42-45) Since immigrating to the United States,\nApplicant has never returned to Afghanistan and has never been visited by any of his\nfamily members residing in Afghanistan. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 53)\n3\n\nApplicant\u2019s family members\nApplicant has numerous family members who are citizens and residents of\nAfghanistan. His parents, three elder brothers and his mother-in-law all are citizens and\nresidents of Afghanistan. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 46) His mother is an educated kindergarten\nteacher for a public school and is compensated by the Afghan government for her\nservices. (Tr. 48-49) His father is a retired military officer who served two years of active\nduty (1979-1981) in the Afghan military forces before being separated in 1981 for\nmedical reasons with the rank of colonel. (GE 2; Tr. 37-38, 41-43, 48-50) Since his\nmedical separation, Applicant\u2019s father has been unemployed and has no affiliation with\nthe Afghan government or any foreign government. (GE 2) None of Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers (inclusive of his parents, brothers, and mother-in-law) residing in Afghanistan\nhave any known affiliations with the Afghan government or military. (GE 2; Tr. 40)\nApplicant maintains monthly telephone contact with his parents and in the past\nhas sent money to them on numerous occasions between May 2008 and June 2011.\n(GE 2) He maintains less frequent contact with his brothers and mother-in-law in\nAfghanistan. He also maintains infrequent contact with uncles, cousins, and other\nextended family members who reside in Afghanistan. (GE 2)\nApplicant continues to provide financial support to his parents and sends them\nmoney every three months. (Tr. 51)  Within the past year, he estimated to have sent his\nparents between $7,000 and $8,000 to help them with their bills. (Tr. 51-53) Between\n2008 and 2011, he estimated to have remitted to his parents sums ranging between\n$150 and $2,000, and exceeding $8,000 in the aggregate. (GE 3)\nCountry information on Afghanistan\nAfghanistan is a country in Southwestern Asia. It is sometimes referred to as the\ncrossroads of Central Asia.  See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 2.  It has had\na turbulent history. \n Following invasions by Alexander, the Scythians, the White Huns, and the Turks,\nthe Arabs invaded Afghanistan in 642 AD and introduced Islam. See Background Note:\nAfghanistan, supra, at 3.  Arab rule held for several hundred years before giving way to\nthe Persians who controlled the region until 998 before succumbing to the Turkic\nGhasnavids. (Id.) Turkish rule under Mahmud was short-lived and was followed by\nattempts by various princes to rule sections of the country before the Mongol invasion of\n1219 under Genghis Khan. (Id.) \nFor many centuries following Khan\u2019s death in 1227, the country was contested by\na succession of chiefs and princes. By the late 14  century, Tamerlane (a Khan\nth\ndescendent) incorporated Afghanistan into a vast Asian empire.  (Id.)\nIn 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani (the founder of what is known today as\nAfghanistan) established his control over most of Afghanistan. British expansion in the\n19  century was countered by Russian advances and precipitated Anglo-Afghan wars\nth\n4\n\nand later led to a boundary accord that created what would become modern Afghanistan. \nSee Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 3.\nSince the British relinquished control in August 1919, Afghanistan has been an\nindependent state. Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 3-4.  Between 1919 and\n1973, Afghanistan moved away from its longstanding isolation under a succession of\nMuslim rulers: King Amanullah (1919-1929), Nadir Khan (1929-1933), and Mohammad\nZahir Shah (Nadir Khan\u2019s 19-year-old son), who ruled Afghanistan for over 40 years\n(1933-1973).  See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra. \nPrime minister between 1953 and 1963, Sardar Mohammad Daoud mounted a\nmilitary coup in 1973 and seized power amid charges of corruption and malfeasance\nagainst Zahir Shah and his royal family. Daoud proceeded to abolish the monarchy,\nabrogate the constitution, and declare Afghanistan a republic. See Background Note:\nAfghanistan, supra, at, 4-5.  His economic and social reforms contributed little, however,\nto stabilizing political conditions in the country. Following a Soviet-supported overthrow\nand assassination of Daoud in April 1978, a Marxist government was formed with the\nbacking of the Soviets.  See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 5. Sur Muhammad\nTaraki was installed as the country\u2019s president of the revolutionary council.  \nOpposition to the Taraki government increased as many of members of Afghan\nelites, religious establishments, and intelligentsia were imprisoned, tortured, or\nmurdered.  A revolt against the Marxist government occurred in the summer of 1978 and\nquickly spread into a countrywide insurgency. (Id.)\nSoviet invasion\nSeeking to take advantage of the unrest following the April 1978 coup, the Soviet\nUnion quickly signed a bilateral treaty of friendship and cooperation with the new Afghan\nregime and increased its military assistance to the regime. See Background Note:\nAfghanistan, supra, at 5-6. Faced with a deteriorating security situation, the Soviets\ninvaded Afghanistan in December 1979, killed the Afghan ruler, and installed Babrak\nKarmal (an exiled leader of the Parcham faction) as the country\u2019s prime minister. (Id.) \nAfghan freedom fighters (mujahideen) who opposed the Karmal communist\nregime, armed with weapons and training assistance from the U.S. and its allies,\ncollaborated with other Peshawar-based guerilla groups in the 1980s to destabilize the\nKarmal regime. See  Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 6-7. The resistance\nmovement eventually led to an agreement known as the Geneva Accords (signed by the\nfront-line states of Pakistan and Afghanistan, the United States, and the Soviet Union).\nThe agreement served to ensure that Soviet forces withdrew from the country in\naccordance with their expressed commitments in February 1989. (Id.) \nAscendency of the Taliban  \nBy the mid-1990s, the Taliban had risen to power in reaction to the anarchy and\nincrease of warlords in the aftermath of the withdrawal of Soviet forces.  Many of the\nTaliban had been educated in madrassas in Pakistan with roots in rural Pashtun areas of\n5\n\nthe country.  See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 7  Beginning with its capture\nof Kandahar in 1994, the Taliban mounted an aggressive expansion of its control\nthroughout Afghanistan. By the end of 1998, its forces occupied almost 90 percent of the\ncountry, and reduced its opposition largely to a small sections of the northeast and the\nPanjshir valley. (Id.)   \nBolstered by its imposition of an extreme interpretation of Islam on the entire\ncountry, the Taliban committed massive human rights violations (particularly directed at\nwomen and children), and committed serious atrocities against minority populations. \nFrom the mid-1990s, the Taliban provided sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, and provided\na base of operations for his and other terrorist organizations. (Background Note:\nAfghanistan, supra, at 7-8). Bin Laden and his Al-Qaida group are known to have\nprovided financial and political support to the Taliban, and Al-Qaida acknowledged their\nresponsibility for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States.    \nBeginning in October 2001 (following the Taliban\u2019s refusal to expel bin Laden), the\nUnited States and its coalition partners initiated a military campaign, targeting terrorist\nfacilities and Taliban military and political assets within Afghanistan. U.S. military and\nanti-Taliban forces routed the Taliban and caused their rapid disintegration. After the fall\nof Kabul in November 2001, a UN-sponsored conference was created to restore stability\nand governance in Afghanistan. See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 7-8. From\nthis conference emerged a Transitional Authority headed by President Hamid Karzai.\nThis authority (renamed the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan) was charged with\nthe responsibility of drafting a constitution. (Id, at 8)\nA new constitution was drafted and ratified by a constitutional loyal jirga on\nJanuary 4, 2004. See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 8. The Afghan\nconstitution provides for indirect election of the National Assembly\u2019s upper house by the\nprovincial councils and by reserved presidential appointments. On December 4, 2004,\nthe country was renamed the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.  (Id; Country Specific\nInformation: Afghanistan, supra, at 1). Hamid Karzai was sworn in as Afghanistan\u2019s\nPresident on December 7, 2004. He presided over the new government\u2019s first convened\nparliament in late 2005. See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra. \nPresidential and provincial elections in Afghanistan for 2010 were  coordinated by\nthe Afghanistan Independent Election Commission (IEC), with assistance from the UN. \nId. Challenged presidential election results in 2010 have not been widely disseminated. \nSee Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 8-9. \n \nPolitical conditions in Afghanistan\nA new democratic government assumed control of Afghanistan in 2004 following a\npopular election.  While the national government has continued to expand its authority, it\nhas been hampered in its ability to deliver necessary social services and remains\ndependent on U.S.-led assistance. See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra. With its\ninternational community support at work, its ability to secure its borders and maintain\ninternal order is increasing. \n6\n\nAlthough the Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan has lost ground in some\nareas, it remains resilient and capable of challenging U.S. and NATO goals. Today,\nAfghanistan\u2019s local government lags, and corruption remains widespread. See\nAdministrative Notice, supra, at 3; Country Reports on Terrorism 2016, Ch. 5, Terrorist\nSafe Havens at 5, U.S. Department of State (July 2017)\nAfghan insurgency and extremist networks, fueled by Taliban, Al Qaida, and\nHaqqani Network support, continue to assert power and intimidation within the country. \nSee Administrative Notice, supra at 4; Country Reports on Terrorism 2016, Chapter 2 at\n1 U.S. Department of State (July 2017) Safety and security remain key concerns\nbecause these terrorist organizations continue to target U.S. and Afghan interests by\nsuicide operations, bombings, assassinations, car-jackings, assaults, and hostage-\ntaking. See Administrative Notice, supra, at 5; Report on Enhancing Security and\nStability in Afghanistan at 1, U.S. Department of Defense (June 2017).  Risks of terrorist\nactivity remain extremely high at the present time. See Administrative Notice, supra, at 3-\n4.\nHuman rights conditions in Afghanistan remain poor by all reported accounts. \nState Department Reports confirm active insurgent activity in Afghanistan. See Country\nReports on Human Rights Practices for 2016, Afghanistan, U.S. Department of State\n(March 2017). The Department of State\u2019s 2016 Human Rights Report also noted\nwidespread violence, predominantly indiscriminate attacks on civilians, armed insurgents\ngroups\u2019 killing of persons affiliated with the Afghan government, and targeted violence\nagainst women and girls. See Administrative Notice Request, supra, at 5-6; Country\nReports on Human Rights Practices for 2016: Afghanistan, supra.\nNo section of Afghanistan is safe or immune from risks of violence, kidnaping,\nhostage taking, military combat, operations, land-mines, banditry, armed rivalry between\npolitical and tribal groups, militant attacks, direct and indirect fire, suicide bombings, and\ninsurgent attacks. See Wave of Attacks Represent a Successful Urban Terrorism\nCampaign, U.S. Department of State at 1-2 (February 2018). Kabul, in particular, has\nexperienced increased militant attacks in recent years, including rocket attacks, vehicle-\nborne improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and suicide bombings. Id. Foreigners\nthroughout the country continue to be targeted for violent attacks and kidnappings: some\nmotivated by terrorism, and others by common criminal activity. \nTo date, Afghanistan has still encountered difficulties in building effective, honest,\nand loyal provincial and district institutions and lacks a coherent tribal engagement\nstrategy for unifying the country. See Administrative Notice, supra, at 3-4; Report on\nEnhancing Security and Stability in Afghanistan, supra, at 1-2. Economic growth has\nbeen similarly slowed by a lack of investor confidence in the Afghan government and its\nprospects for the future.\nU.S.-Afghanistan relations\nLooking to the future, the United States recognizes the many challenges that the\nunity government of Afghanistan will continue to contend with as their leaders settle their\nown respective responsibilities. See Report on Enhancing Security and Stability in\n7\n\nAfghanistan, supra at 3. Despite these challenges, the fundamental partnership between\nthe U.S.-led coalition and the Afghan government remains strong. (Id.) Afghanistan\nremains an important partner of the United States in its war against terrorism., and the\nUnited States continues to deploy resources to assist Afghanistan improve its security,\ngovernance, institutions, and economy. See Administrative Notice, supra, at 6.\nSince the fall of the Taliban, the United States has supported the creation of a\nbroad-based government in Afghanistan, and has made a long-term commitment to help\nAfghanistan reconstitute and rebuild following years of war and unstable governments. \nThe United States and its coalition partners in the international community currently\nprovide important humanitarian assistance, capacity-building, security protection,\ncounter-narcotic programs, and infrastructure projects. The United States has also\nbrought important political influence to bear on the establishment of durable democratic\nprinciples that recognize and incorporate democratic principles, promote the rule of law\nand encourage transparent and accountable forms of government. See Report on\nEnhancing Security and Stability in Afghanistan, supra.\nIn May 2012, the United States and Afghanistan signed the Enduring Strategic\nPartnership Agreement, demonstrated the United States\u2019 shared commitment to the\ncombating of terrorism and the promoting of democratic values and economic\nopportunity in Afghanistan and the region. See U.S. Relations with Afghanistan Fact\nSheet at 1-2, U.S. Department of State (January 2017). Through new initiatives forged\nbetween Afghanistan and the United States, beginning with the Silk Road Initiative\ncompleted in 2011, as a means of reconstructing infrastructure links in the region, both\ncountries have helped to bolster peace and stability in the region by supporting a\ntransition to trade and the opening of new markets in Central Asia and beyond. See  U.S.\nRelations with Afghanistan Fact Sheet at 1-2.\n  What strategic options the United States ultimately adopts to enhance its\nworking relations with Afghan\u2019s unity government in their joint efforts to limit the\nadvances of an increasingly aggressive Taliban are uncertain at this time. Efforts\nbetween the two countries continue to be exerted to promote economic growth, bolster\nAfghanistan\u2019s business climate, improve the performance of the country\u2019s justice system,\nand help the Afghan government to maintain, and improve upon, the gains the country\nhas made over the last decade in the areas of health, education, and women\u2019s rights.\nSee  U.S. Relations with Afghanistan Fact Sheet, supra, at 2.\nPrior employer terminations\nBetween July 2015 and March 2016, Applicant was twice terminated by\nrespective employers for violations of company policy. In July 2015, he was terminated\nby Company A due to cited policy violations relative to complaints of unwanted sexual\nadvances. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 56-57) At the time of his termination from Company A, he was a\nfull-time deputy jailer with a local detention center in his city of residence. Applicant\nexpressed surprise at the time of his termination and insisted he had done nothing wrong\nto warrant the termination. (GE 2; Tr. 56)\n8\n\nIn March 2016, Applicant was employed by another detention center and was\nterminated for cited reasons of violating company policy in socializing with a company\nvisitor. (GEs 2-3) Applicant insisted he did nothing wrong to warrant his termination by\nthis company. (GE 2; Tr. 57)\nAsked about his terminations in his scheduled interview with an investigator from\nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant acknowledged the terminations,\nwhile expressing surprise. (GE 2) His supervisor employed by the Company A detention\ncenter credited Applicant with honor, integrity, and superb job performance and\nattributed his termination to falling prey \u201cto people in power that wanted him not to work\nthere.\u201d (AE G) The current elected jailer with the Company B detention center could not\nprovide any further explanations of his termination. (AE G) \nBased on the competing versions offered of the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s termination from Company A, inferences are warranted that\nApplicant\u2019s account provides the most detailed and convincing version. Allegations of\npoor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness associated with Applicant\u2019s 2015\ntermination are unsubstantiated. \nAddressing his 2016 termination from Company B at the hearing, Applicant\nattributed his termination to disagreements with the cited deputy who was involved in a\nsexual encounter with a female employee. (Tr. 29-31) Applicant insisted that he had\nnever made any sexual advances on the employee and was falsely accused of doing so\nto divert attention from the guilty deputy. Applicant\u2019s accounts of this cited incident\nappear to be credible and are not controverted by any corroborating evidence to the\ncontrary. Likewise, allegations of poor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness\nassociated with Applicant\u2019s 2016 termination are unsubstantiated. \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nBetween 2013 and 2017, Applicant accumulated 13 delinquent debts exceeding\n$11,500 according to his most recent credit reports. (GEs 4-6 and 7) Applicant attributed\nthese debts to periods of unemployment and not paying enough attention to addressing\nhis creditor obligations in a timely way. (GE 2; Tr. 50-53) With the responsibilities he has\nin caring for his wife and children as a sole provider, he has not been in a position to\naddress his debts. His available income sources have been further attenuated by the\nmonies he has committed to helping his parents in Afghanistan. (Tr. 50-53)\nSince his hearing, Applicant has provided documentation of addressing several of\nhis smaller debts. He provided proof of his unsuccessful contact effort to establish\npayment arrangement with SOR creditor 1.a (who holds a delinquent debt of $3,235).\n(AE H) He provided documented proof, too, of resolving the following debts: SOR debts\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c (with a $130 payment in satisfaction of the reported $1,040 debt); 1.e (with a $100\npayment in satisfaction of $416 debt); 1.h (with a $76 payment); and 1.k (a $211\npayment in satisfaction of $681debt). (AEs H-K) Payment totals for these debts total\n$517 on listed aggregate amounts of $2,213. This still leaves unresolved debts\nexceeding $9,700. Among his remaining debts are two judgments: one entered in June\n9\n\n2014 for $2,009 (SOR debt \u00b6 1.i) and another entered in April 2014 for $1,331 (SOR\ndebt \u00b6 1.j). At this time, he could provide no firm plans for addressing his remaining\ndebts with the income sources currently available to him. (Tr. 33)\nEndorsements and Awards\nApplicant is highly regarded by high-ranking U.S. officials and senior military\ncommanders who worked closely with Applicant during Afghan military operations\nbetween 2002 and 2008. (AEs A and G) Senior U.S. officials credited Applicant with\nexceptional translation work while working in sensitive roles as an Embassy translator.\n(A-D) Senior military members credited Applicant with superb translation services in\npositions requiring high trust while embedded with military commands operating in\nAfghanistan. (AEs E and G) They expressed their appreciation for his extraordinary\nlinguist support that consistently exceeded their expectations. (AEs E and G) Each of the\nArmy commanders he worked closely with in combat missions characterized hm as a\nlinguist with strong character traits that served him well in the performance of his duties.\n(AEs E and G)\nFormer coworkers and family members who know Applicant attest to his strong\nwork ethic and overall good character. (AE M) They credited him with traits of honesty\nand integrity.\nApplicant  earned numerous certificates of merit achievement and appreciation\nfrom the  military commands he worked closely with while assigned to Afghanistan. (AE\nF) These awards express gratitude for Applicant\u2019s commitment and achievements to his\nmilitary commands while working foreign translation assignments. (AE F) \nPolicies\nThe SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the\nconditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied.  Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive\nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in\narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(d) of the AGs,\nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense\ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context\nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period\n10\n\nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the\napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to,\nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a security concern if they result in divided\nallegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create circumstances in\nwhich the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign\ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest\nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is known to\ntarget U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.   See AG \u00b6 6.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or\nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful\nand candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. . .,\nAG \u00b6 15. \nFinancial Considerations\n The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress\ncan also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health\nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of dependence. An individual who is\n11\n\nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise\nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511\n(1995)  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis\nApplicant is a highly regarded former linguist who currently works for a U.S.-\nbased defense contractor in an administrative capacity. He is an Afghan citizen by\nbirth and a naturalized U.S. citizen with permanent residency in the United States.\nForeign influence concerns relate to Applicant\u2019s having immediate and extended\nfamily members who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan, a country with a\nsomewhat checkered history of wars, political instability, and violence. \nAdditional security concerns are raised with respect to Applicant\u2019s previous\nterminations with company A and with Company B. Applicant\u2019s history of problems\nwith managing his finances also raises security concerns.  \n12\n\nForeign influence concerns\nDespite encouraging efforts in the development of strategic partnerships\nbetween Afghanistan and the United States in recent years, Afghanistan remains a\nwar-torn country and one still in the process of establishing a stable democratic\ngovernment that is able to build effective, honest, and loyal provincial and district\ninstitutions, provide effective protections for its constituent groups, and maintain cross-\nborder security. The historically close relationship between Applicant and his\nimmediate family members who reside in Afghanistan makes them potentially\nvulnerable to coercion and non-coercive measures.  \nBecause Taliban, Al Qaida, and Haqqani Network insurgents operating in\nAfghanistan have a history of violating Afghan domestic laws and regulations, as well\nas international laws, they are more likely to use improper and illegal means, or one of\nthe other, to obtain classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control through\nhis family members still residing in Afghanistan. DC \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of\nmethod, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion,\u201d applies.   \nTo date, none of Applicant\u2019s parents, three brothers, and mother-in-law residing\nin Afghanistan have any history of being subjected to any coercion or influence. These\nhistorical antecedents do limit the severity of any potential conflict situation. However,\nthe absence of any past coercive measures taken by Afghan authorities does not\ncompletely absolve Applicant from coercive risks in the future given Afghanistan\u2019s \nconsiderable history of wars, political instability, violence, hostage taking, and abusive\nmeasures taken against its own citizens.  For these reasons, \u00b6 DC 7(b), \u201cconnections\nto a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of\ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information\nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information or technology,\u201d has some application to Applicant and his\nfamily members residing in Afghanistan. \nStill, none of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members have any known current\naffiliations or connections with the Afghan government or their military, or any other\nforeign government. Any potential conflict that might be associated with his sisters\npresents a low risk and not likely to pose any conflicts of interest for Applicant in the\nforeseeable future. \nAs a nation, Afghanistan continues to be a country with emerging strategic\nrelationships with the United States and is a front-line partner in the war on terror. \nBecause of the security dangers that still confront U.S. and Afghanistan forces\noperating in the region, Afghanistan remains a country that presents a heightened risk. \nAfghanistan is also a country that is benefitting from long-term U.S. commitments to\nhelp the Afghan government and its tribal regions reconstitute and rebuild their\ninstitutions and infrastructure in the aftermath of years of war, human rights abuses, \n13\n\nand political and economic mismanagement under Soviet-backed regimes and Taliban\nrule. Given the current geopolitical infrastructure that exists in Afghanistan, the risk of\na pressure or influence situation involving an immediate or extended family member of\nApplicant\u2019s can be characterized as somewhat reduced, commensurate with improved\nsecurity and political conditions on the ground in the country. \nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or\nmandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of\nforeign countries in general. What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one\nforeign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical\nnecessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Afghanistan. The\nAGs take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the United States as\nan important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship\nand residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk.\nApplicant\u2019s situation is a special one for reasons that pertain wholly to his\nunique status and circumstances as a linguist working with diplomatic personnel and\nmilitary commands operating in Afghanistan. Not only has he been careful to avoid\nany frequent contact with his sisters and in-laws in Afghanistan, but he has been\nscrupulous about making certain his family members are not aware of his linguist\nassignments and duties that cover Afghan culture and political conditions. \nIn special circumstances involving linguists who put themselves in harm\u2019s way\nby working in unstable countries where they have family members residing, the\nAppeal Board has been quick to note that such individuals are more likely to\nrecognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or\ninsurgent group at coercion or exploitation. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App.\nBd. Feb. 5, 2008).  Applicant\u2019s strong connections to the United States and to his wife\nand children, his record of distinguished service as a linguist for high U.S. officials and\nmilitary commands operating in Afghanistan make it highly unlikely he would ever\nresolve any potential conflict against his U.S. interests.  \nBased on his case-specific circumstances, MC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United\nStates,\u201d is available to Applicant. Balancing security interests associated with\nApplicant\u2019s Afghanistan-based family members, conclusions warrant that neither\nApplicant nor his immediate or extended family members residing in Afghanistan pose\nany heightened security risks that could subject them to potential pressures and\ninfluence from Afghan  government and military officials. \nOf benefit to Applicant, too, is  MC \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or\nallegiance to the group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has\n14\n\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments\nto the United States are well demonstrated and sufficient under these circumstances\nto neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in his relationships with his\nimmediate and extended family residing in Afghanistan.   \nTwo other mitigating conditions have application to Applicant\u2019s situation.  MC \u00b6\u00b6\n8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d\nand 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property\ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used\neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d are fully applicable.\nApplicant has no current property or other financial interests in Afghanistan, and there\nis an uncertain likelihood of his ever acquiring any inheritance rights in the country that\ncould create any conflicts in the foreseeable future. What is known about his parents\nis that they have modest resources and receive some financial support from Applicant. \nPersonal conduct concerns\nBased on the absence of any corroborating evidence to challenge Applicant\u2019s\naccounts of the facts and circumstances surrounding his terminations from Companies\nA and B in 2015 and 2016, respectively, allegations of misconduct attributed to\nApplicant in both instances are neither corroborated nor substantiated. Applicant\u2019s full\naccounts are accepted as the most credible versions of the events that transpired\nleading up to his terminations. \nFinancial concerns\nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts between 2014 and 2016. Altogether, Applicant accumulated over\n$12,000 in delinquent debts over a three-year period (2014-2016) that he has not\nsufficiently addressed to date to absolve himself of security concerns. Applicant\u2019s debt\ndelinquencies warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts negate the need for any independent\nproof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006).\nEach of Applicant\u2019s admitted debts are fully documented and create some judgment\nissues. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is\nrequired precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance\nthat entitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a\nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to\n15\n\ncoercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax\nfiling lapses and debt delinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing debt delinquencies are critical to an\nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in\nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified\ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App.\nBd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).\nApplicant\u2019s cited extenuating circumstances (i.e., past unemployment and periodic\nremittances to his parents in Afghanistan) are extenuating and entitle Applicant to\npartial mitigation  credit for his inability to address his debt delinquencies. \nMC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has partial application to Applicant\u2019s\nsituation. His failure to more of his debt delinquencies after he returned to full time\nemployment status in December 2016 precludes him, however, from taking more\nadvantage of the \u201cacted responsibly\u201d prong of MC \u00b6 20(b).\nSatisfaction of Applicant\u2019s evidentiary burden of providing probative evidence of\nhis addressing his debt delinquencies requires more documentation of his working\npayment efforts than he has provided in his submissions. While his extenuating\ncircumstances are highly probative, they are not enough to mitigate his major financial\ndelinquencies without more evidence of past and recent efforts to address more of his\ndelinquent debts than he has been able to do with the income sources available to him\nwith his full-time employment. While his post-hearing efforts of addressing several of\nhis smaller creditors are encouraging, they still leave unresolved over 85% of his listed \ncreditors without any documented concrete plans to resolve them.\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of\nfederal and state tax debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, his failures or inability to establish documented payment initiatives \nwith his listed SOR creditors, both before and after the initiation of the security\nclearance process, prelude favorable findings and conclusions with respect to raised\nsecurity concerns over the state of his finances.  \nWhole-person assessment\nTo complete a  whole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence and\nfinancial risks to ascertain whether they are fully compatible with minimum security\nclearance eligibility requirements, Applicant\u2019s substantial civilian contributions to U.S.\nsecurity interests as an Afghan linguist between 2002 and 2008 require careful\nbalancing with the raised security concerns. Applicant\u2019s endorsements and certificates\nof appreciation attest to his valuable contributions to U.S. military and diplomatic\n16\n\nservices operating in Afghanistan. They are impressive and warrant considerable\nappreciation for his contributions to U.S. security interests. \nWhole-person assessment is available also to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to\nconflicts of interests with his Afghan family members. So, in Applicant\u2019s case, the\npotential risk of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought to bear on him, or any\nof his respective family members residing in Afghanistan, is very low and mitigated.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s past contributions to U.S. security interests (impressive as they\nare) are not enough at this time to mitigate security concerns over the state of his\nfinances.  Without more evidence of payment initiatives, it is still too soon to make\nsafe predictions that Applicant can gain control of and consistently manage his\nfinancial affairs in a stable manner.   \nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following\nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):      AGAINST APPLICANT\n     Subparagraphs 1.b-1.d, 1.f-1.g, 1.I -1.j, 1.l-1.m:     Against Applicant\n     \n     Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.k:                     For Applicant     \nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):                    FOR APPLICANT\n     Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:\n                               For Applicant    \n        \nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\n          FOR APPLICANT\n    Subparagraphs 3.a-3.d:                                            For Applicant\n \n Conclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified\ninformation.

Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 10, 2017, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On September 13, \n2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of \ninterrogatories, essentially to verify the accuracy of his Enhanced Subject Interview of \nMarch 28, 2017. On October 23, 2017, he did so, with corrections. On November 7, 2017, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \n01/17/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), \nG (Alcohol Consumption), F (Financial Considerations), and E (Personal Conduct), and \ndetailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor occupying a public trust position to support a contract with the DOD. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on November 17, 2017. In a sworn statement, dated \nDecember 5, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was \nprepared to proceed on January 3, 2018. The case was assigned to me on March 20, \n2018. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 29, 2018, scheduling the hearing for July \n26, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 6 and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE F were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 7, 2018. I kept the record open to \nenable Applicant to supplement it. He failed to take advantage of that opportunity. The \nrecord closed on August 23, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, nearly all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d., \nand 1.f. through 1.j.); and financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. through 3.i., and 3.k. \nthrough 3.q.). He failed to admit or deny the allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption, \nso a denial was registered for him. He denied, with comments, all of the remaining \nallegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving, \nfirst as the manager, web business, and currently as an application systems developer, \nwith his current employer since May 1999. A 1990 high school graduate, Applicant earned \nsome college credits, but no degree. He has never served in the U.S. military. He has \nnever held a security clearance, but has been occupying a position of public trust since \n1999. Applicant was married in 1993. He has three children, born in 1993, 1995, and \n1998, respectively, and is now a grandfather. \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nCriminal Conduct and Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nApplicant starting consuming alcohol when he was 15-years old. He eventually \ngenerally drank 12 12-ounce beers over a three-day weekend, every weekend, or an \nunspecified amount of alcohol every other day, to feel calm and relaxed. He estimated \nthat a half-pint of liquor and a 12-pack of beer would make him feel intoxicated. He \nbecame intoxicated monthly. Applicant acknowledged that he is an alcoholic, but he \ncontends that he stopped drinking alcohol in about June 2016.1 He indicated that after \nthe 2013 incident, described below, he obtained counseling assistance from the \nEmployee Association Program (EAP), and he attended five sessions with a certified \npsychologist. He was referred to Alcohol Anonymous (AA). He claimed that he regularly \nattends Alcohol Anonymous (AA) three times per week, but acknowledged that he has \nnot been to an AA meeting during the three weeks leading up to the hearing; he has an \nAA sponsor; and he attends an unspecified number of church-related Adult Children of \nAlcoholics (ACOA) counseling sessions with a spiritual advisor. ACOA is an organization \nintended to provide a forum for individuals who desire to recover from the effects of \ngrowing up in an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family.  \n \nApplicant stated an intention of never picking up another drink in his life, but if he \nfails in doing so, he believes he has a strong foundation and support network to help him \nget back on the right track.2 Applicant failed to submit any documentation or witnesses to \nsupport his contentions that: (1) he no longer consumes alcohol, and the date he stopped \nconsuming it; (2) he attends AA, or the nature of his participation; or (3) he attends ACOA, \nand the nature and frequency of the meetings and counseling sessions. \n \nThe SOR alleged one incident of criminality by Applicant in 1991, and another \nseven incidents over a period 14 years, commencing in 2001 and continuing until 2015. \nAt least three of those incidents were alcohol-related:  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.): In April 1991, one month shy of his 19th birthday, Applicant was \narrested and charged with Attempt to Commit Robbery, Conspiracy to Commit Robbery, \nand Simple Assault. The two robbery-related charges were dismissed, and Applicant pled \nguilty to Simple Assault. He was placed on probation for two years;3 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.): In July 2001, Applicant was charged with Driving Without a License, \na misdemeanor, as opposed to the charge Driving Under Suspension (DUS). Applicant \ndenied being aware that his operator\u2019s license had been \u201csuspended\u201d; although, he \nsubsequently indicated that because he had a number of tickets, the license from another \n                                                          \n1 GE 2 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated March 28, 2017), at 6; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, \ndated December 5, 2017; Tr. at 45, 65. \n \n2 GE 2, supra note 1, at 6; Tr. at 46-47, 56-57, 63-66. \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4 (Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \nIdentification Record, dated February 2, 2017). \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nstate may have been suspended. He was convicted as charged. The sentence was not \nreported;4  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c.): In August 2006, Applicant was charged with Driving Without a \nLicense, a misdemeanor, once again as opposed to the charge DUS. He again denied \nbeing aware that his operator\u2019s license had been suspended, and he thought it had been \ntransferred to his current state of residence during a \u201cperiod of transition.\u201d The disposition \nof the charge was not reported;5 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.): In December 2006, Applicant was charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence (DUI), Driving Without a License, and Violation ABC Law, all misdemeanors, \nafter losing control of his vehicle on an Interstate highway and striking a guard rail, \nbreaking his neck. Once again, he was not charged with DUS. In this instance, Applicant \nacknowledged that he lost his operator\u2019s license because of excessive parking tickets.6 \nHe also acknowledged that he had consumed four or five 12-ounce beers before he \ndrove.7 Although the disposition of the charges was not reported in the FBI Identification \nRecord,8 Applicant indicated that he was fined;9  \n \n (SOR \u00b6 1.e.): In April 2007, Applicant was charged with Fraudulent Check Under \n$500 \u2013 1st, a misdemeanor. Although Applicant denied that he was ever formally charged \nwith a crime related to the \u201cinadvertently bounced\u201d check, he was, in fact, convicted of the \ncharge and fined $93.73;10 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.): In November 2012, Applicant was charged with DUS, a \nmisdemeanor. He was convicted of the charge and fined $652.50;11 \n                                                          \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; Tr. at 28-29; GE 4, supra note 3. According to the \nstate statute covering the cited charge:  \n \nA person who drives a motor vehicle on a public highway of this State without a driver's \nlicense in violation of [the section] is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction of a first \noffense, must be fined not less than fifty dollars nor more than one hundred dollars or \nimprisoned for thirty days and, upon conviction of a second offense, be fined five hundred \ndollars or imprisoned for forty-five days, or both, and for a third and subsequent offense \nmust be imprisoned for not less than forty-five days nor more than six months. \n \n5 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; Tr. at 30-32; GE 4, supra note 3. \n \n6 Tr. at 34; GE 2, supra note 1, at 5. \n \n7 GE 2, supra note 1, at 5. \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3. \n \n9 GE 2, supra note 1, at 5. \n \n10 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3. \n \n11 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3. According to the state \nstatute covering the cited charge: \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g.): In May 2013, after arguing with his wife and consuming \u201ca couple of \nbeers\u201d with a friend, Applicant was charged with DUI \u2013 1st, Open Container, and DUS, all \nmisdemeanors;12 and he was convicted of Reckless Driving and DUS. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h.): In December 2015, Applicant was charged with Habitual Traffic \nOffender, a felony, DUI \u2013 3rd, a misdemeanor, and DUS \u2013 3rd, a misdemeanor. The DUS \ncharge was nolle prossed, and the disposition of the other charges was not reported. \nApplicant contended that upon his successful completion of a court ordered DUI program, \nlasting four days per week for a period of one year, with random urinalysis, and total \nalcohol abstinence, his DUI would be expunged. He claimed he successfully completed \nthe program in November 2017,13 but he failed to submit any documentation about the \nprogram, his participation in the program, or his successful completion of the program. \n                                                          \n \nA person who drives a motor vehicle on a public highway of this State when the person's \nlicense to drive is canceled, suspended, or revoked must, upon conviction, be punished as \nfollows: \n \n(a) for a first offense, fined three hundred dollars or imprisoned for up to thirty days, or both; \n(b) for a second offense, fined six hundred dollars or imprisoned for up to sixty consecutive \ndays, or both; and (c) for a third or subsequent offense, fined one thousand dollars, and \nimprisoned for up to ninety days or confined to a person's place of residence pursuant to \nthe Home Detention Act for up to ninety days. No portion of a term of imprisonment or \nconfinement under home detention may be suspended by the trial judge except when the \ncourt is suspending a term of imprisonment upon successful completion of the terms and \nconditions of confinement under home detention. For purposes of this item, a person \nsentenced to confinement pursuant to the Home Detention Act is required to pay for the \ncost of such confinement. \n \n(e)(i) A person convicted of a first or second offense of this item, as determined by the \nrecords of the department, and who is employed or enrolled in a college or university at \nany time while the person's driver's license is suspended pursuant to this item, may apply \nfor a route restricted driver's license permitting the person to drive only to and from work \nor the person's place of education and in the course of the person's employment or \neducation during the period of suspension. The department may issue the route restricted \ndriver's license only upon a showing by the person that the person is employed or enrolled \nin a college or university and that the person lives further than one mile from the person's \nplace of employment or place of education. \n \n12 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3. \n \n13 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3; Tr. at 52-54. According to the \nstate statute covering the cited charge: \n \nAn habitual offender shall mean any person whose record as maintained by the \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles shows that he has accumulated the convictions for separate \nand distinct offenses described in subsections (a), (b) and (c) committed during a three-\nyear period; provided, that where more than one included offense shall be committed within \na one-day period such multiple offenses shall be treated for the purposes of this article as \none offense: \n \n(a) Three or more convictions, singularly or in combination of any of the following separate \nand distinct offenses arising out of separate acts: (1) Voluntary manslaughter, involuntary \nmanslaughter or reckless homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle; (2) \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nApplicant claimed that over an extended period of years, especially when his \noperator\u2019s license was suspended, or when he did not actually have a license, he rarely \ndrove his vehicle. He said he got to work as part of a car pool with his wife or others \ndriving, and on other occasions when the children were in the car, also with his wife \ndriving. He noted that on some of occasions, such as when he was stopped by the police, \nor during an emergency situation with a sick child, he was not accompanied by his wife.14 \n \nApplicant also attributed the reasons for the suspensions of his operator\u2019s license \nto the parking issues; tax liens; failure to pay property tax on the vehicle; or the \ncancellation of his automobile insurance.15 During the hearing, Applicant stated that he \ncurrently does not have an operator\u2019s license as it was suspended because of his \ndesignation as a habitual traffic offender.16 \n \nFinancial Considerations17 \n  \nApplicant acknowledged that when he started his family at the age of 21, he did \nnot understand the value of a dollar or what exactly \u201ccredit\u201d meant. That lack of \nunderstanding, coupled with his \u201calcoholism,\u201d left him in a financial hole. He claimed to \nhave hired a credit repair company to assist him in rebuilding his credit, essentially by \ndisputing most of the delinquent accounts listed in his credit reports, as well as financial \nadvisors to help him spend his money wisely.18 He failed to submit documentation to \n                                                          \nOperating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating \nliquor, narcotics or drugs; (3) Driving or operating a motor vehicle in a reckless manner; (4) \nDriving a motor vehicle while his license, permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has \nbeen suspended or revoked, except a conviction for driving under suspension for failure to \nfile proof of financial responsibility; (5) Any offense punishable as a felony under the motor \nvehicle laws of this State or any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used;  \n(6) Failure of the driver of a motor vehicle involved in any accident resulting in the death or \ninjury of any person to stop close to the scene of such accident and report his identity; \n \n(b) Ten or more convictions of separate and distinct offenses involving moving violations \nsingularly or in combination, in the operation of a motor vehicle, which are required to be \nreported to the department for which four or more points are assigned pursuant to [the \nstatute] or which are enumerated in subsection (a) of this section. \n \n(c) The offenses included in subsections (a) and (b) shall be deemed to include offenses \nunder any federal law, any law of another state or any municipal or county ordinance of \nanother state substantially conforming to the above provisions. \n \n14 Tr. at 32, 42-43, 60. \n \n15 Tr. at 39-41. \n \n16 Tr. at 28-29, 58-59. \n \n17 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: GE 2, supra note 1; GE 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit \nReport, dated March 7, 2017); GE 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated October 30, 2017); AE A (Credit Plus \nCredit Report, dated July 12, 2018); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1.   \n  \n18 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nsupport his claims that a credit repair company had been hired; the identity of that \ncompany; what that company had actually done for him or in his behalf; that financial \nadvisors had been hired; the identity of the financial advisors; or what type of guidance \nthey had furnished him. Additionally, aside from Applicant\u2019s lack or financial knowledge, \ncoupled with his alcoholism, it is unclear how or when his financial problems first \nemerged.  \nIn February 2005, Applicant and his wife filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy \nunder Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and in September 2007, that bankruptcy \nwas discharged after the Bankruptcy Trustee had disbursed $36,854.20 to various \ncreditors, including the U.S. Treasury and the state department of revenue.19  \nDespite the bankruptcy discharge and the relative abatement of his financial issues \nassociated with the Bankruptcy Trustee\u2019s rejection of various accounts, within three \nyears, Applicant\u2019s financial problems mushroomed once again. In 2010, the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) notified him that because of errors in his income tax returns he \nowed the IRS between $10,000 and $20,000, and a voluntary repayment plan withdrawal \nwas established, ending in approximately 2014-2015. In 2011 and 2012, several accounts \nbecame delinquent, and over the ensuing years, even more accounts became \ndelinquent.20 In 2014, a number of tax liens were filed against him.21 \nIn addition to the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the SOR identified 16 purportedly \ndelinquent accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off, as generally \nreflected by Applicant\u2019s March 2017 or October 2017 credit reports. Those debts total \napproximately $12,275. The current status of those accounts is as follows: \nThere has been no change in the status of a vast majority of Applicant\u2019s accounts \nthat were placed for collection. While many of them were unsuccessfully disputed for \nreasons not explained, the following accounts remain unaddressed and unresolved, as \nacknowledged by Applicant: various medical accounts with unpaid balances of $90 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b.); $125 (SOR \u00b6 1.c.), $561 (SOR \u00b6 1.d.); $225 (SOR \u00b6 1.e.); $85 (SOR \u00b6 1.k.); $415 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.n.); and $760 (SOR \u00b6 1.o.); and other accounts: two bank-issued credit-card \n                                                          \n \n19 GE 3 (Bankruptcy Petition and Final Report and Account, various dates). \n \n20 GE 2, supra note 1, at 6; GE 5, supra note 17.  \n \n21 GE 5, supra note 17, at 5-7; Tr. at 69-72.

Applicant\u2019s unlisted and unalleged delinquent accounts and tax liens will be considered only for the \nfive purposes listed above.  \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \naccounts with unpaid balances that were charged off in the amounts of $179 (SOR \u00b6 1.l.) \nand $171 (SOR \u00b6 1.m.); a cable-television account with an unpaid balance of $689 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.p.); and a fitness center account with an unpaid balance of $2,090, that Applicant \nintends to start making unspecified payments to in August 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.q.).22     \nThere are also some accounts that Applicant claims he has either made payments \nto, or has paid them off. There are three medical accounts with unpaid balances of $162 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.); $85 (SOR \u00b6 1.g.); and $51 (SOR \u00b6 1.h.).23 Applicant\u2019s most recent credit \nreport reflects seven delinquent medical accounts with the same collection agent. Only \nthree of those accounts are alleged in the SOR. Applicant submitted a May 2018 receipt \nfrom the collection agent, in the amount of $405.66,24 and he contended that the payment \ncovered all of the delinquent accounts with that one collection agent. He submitted three \nletters from the collection agent indicating that ten different accounts, including the three \nlisted in the SOR had been settled in full.25 AE B refers to the three SOR-related accounts. \nThose three accounts have been resolved. \nThe two remaining accounts refer to a lease with an unpaid balance of $6,507 due \nto damage (SOR \u00b6 1.i.) that was placed for collection; and a student loan with an unpaid \nbalance of $80 (SOR \u00b6 1.j.).26 With respect to the former account, Applicant contends that \nhe reached out to the creditor and agreed to a repayment plan under which, starting in \nMarch 2018, he would pay $100 per month.27 Regarding the latter account, he contended \nthat he paid the creditor the outstanding amount in June or July 2018.28 Applicant failed \nto submit documentation to support his contentions that payments had been made to \neither creditor, even though he indicated that he would do so if the record would be kept \nopen. In the absence of such documentation, neither account has been resolved. \nDuring the hearing, Applicant was requested to complete a Personal Financial \nStatement to reflect his monthly net income; monthly expenses; and a monthly remainder \navailable for discretionary saving or spending. He failed to do so. However, during the \nhearing, he acknowledged that his annual salary was about $74,000 and his wife\u2019s annual \nsalary was about $125,000, for a total of approximately $200,000.29 He has less than \n$1,000 in his 401(k), after withdrawing $10,000 in anticipation of closing on his new \n                                                          \n22 GE 5, supra note 17; GE 6, supra note 17; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; Tr. at \n78-80, 93-97. \n \n23 GE 5, supra note 17; GE 6, supra note 17; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1.  \n \n24 AE E (Receipt, dated May 17, 2018). \n \n25 AE B (Letter, dated May 17, 2018); AE C (Letter, dated May 17, 2018); AE D (Letter, dated May \n17, 2018); Tr. at 80-90. \n \n26 GE 5, supra note 17; GE 6, supra note 17; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1. \n \n27 Tr. at 90-92. \n \n28 Tr. at 91-93. \n \n29 Tr. at 101. \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nresidence; and less than $1,000 at the end of each month for discretionary saving or \nspending.30 He purchased a new hybrid sport-utility vehicle (SUV) for his wife in 2016. In \nresponse to a question as to why he failed to make more progress with modest or \nminimum delinquent debts with a combined annual income of $200,000, Applicant could \nnot respond, claiming that because \u201cwe have a ton of bills,\u201d they are trying to adjust their \nfinances. Applicant disputed certain accounts solely because he disagreed with the \namounts reflected. He was unable to explain why his finances went into such disarray \nbefore 2005 as to justify his filing for bankruptcy; and he was unable to explain why his \nfinances deteriorated in 2007 to create his current delinquencies. Although the record \nremained open, he also failed to furnish a requested updated status of his SOR-related \naccounts supported by receipts, checks, or letters related to those debts; and a copy of \nhis repayment plan showing any priority for addressing his delinquent accounts.  \nPersonal Conduct31 \n(SOR \u00b6 4.a.): This allegation cross-references the SOR allegations associated with \nhis criminal conduct and alcohol consumption. \n(SOR \u00b6 4.b.):  On January 10, 2017, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he \nresponded to certain questions pertaining to his police record found in Section 22. Those \nquestions requested certain information regardless of whether the record in his case had \nbeen sealed, expunged, or otherwise stricken from the court record, or the charge was \ndismissed. Certain convictions, not relevant here, did not need to be reported. Those \nquestions were essentially as follows: In the past seven years have you been: a. issued \na summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against you?; b. \narrested by any police officer, sheriff, marshal, or any other type of law enforcement \nofficial?; c. charged, convicted, or sentenced of a crime in any court?; and d. or are you \ncurrently on probation or parole? In addition, are you currently on trial or awaiting a trial \non criminal charges? Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to the combined questions, and he \nreported the incident from 2013 in which he said he was charged with DUI, but reduced \nto Reckless Driving, and ordered to pay a fine.32 He omitted the 2013 DUS charge, the \nNovember 2012 DUS charge; and the December 2015 DUI, DUS, and Felony Habitual \nTraffic Offender charges. He certified that his responses to those questions were \u201ctrue, \ncomplete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, because of his \nomissions, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.  \nApplicant subsequently offered differing explanations for the omissions. He either \ndid not recall the 2012 or 2015 incidents; did not consider traffic incidents to be criminal; \n                                                          \n30 Tr. at 102-107. \n \n31 During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 4.a. by deleting that portion of \nthe allegation that reads \u201cand 3.a. through 3.q.\u201d There being no objection, the motion was granted, and the \nSOR was amended as indicated.

He denied deliberately failing to disclose the omitted information. \n(SOR \u00b6 4.c.): On January 10, 2017, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he also \nresponded to certain questions pertaining to his finances found in Section 26. Those \nquestions asked if, in the past seven years, he had any bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency; or he had any account or credit card suspended or cancelled for failing \nto pay as agreed. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to each of the questions.33 He certified that his \nresponses to those questions were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his \nknowledge and belief, but the responses to those questions were, in fact, false. He \nomitted every one of the 16 delinquent accounts that were eventually alleged in the SOR \nas well as the tax issues that were not alleged; even though those tax liens were not \nresolved until 2014, well within the seven-year period of interest. \nApplicant subsequently offered differing explanations for the omissions. He \nclaimed that at the time he completed his e-QIP, he was unaware that he had any such \ndelinquent accounts; a creditor reached out to him after the e-QIP was completed; he \nthought \u201call that stuff was off [his] credit report;\u201d he thought his medical bills had been \npaid; he did not think that tax liens would show up on his credit report; and he did not \nconsider a voluntary payment to be the same as a garnishment.34 He denied deliberately \nfailing to disclose the omitted information. \nWork Performance \n \nA review of several years\u2019 of Applicant\u2019s annual performance reviews reveals a \nnumber of bonus and incentive payments as well as final overall ratings that generally fall \nwithin the \u201csometimes exceeds expectations\u201d with occasional \u201cmeets expectations\u201d and \none \u201cconsistently exceeds expectations.\u201d35 \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d36 As Commander in Chief, the President \nhas the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d39 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.40  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.41 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including those in the DOD CAF \ncase file, those submitted by Applicant, his testimony, as well as an assessment of \nApplicant=s demeanor and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal \nprecepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in \nthe SOR: \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise trustworthiness \nconcerns: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \nApplicant has established a lengthy pattern of criminality involving felonies and \nmisdemeanors. There is one incident of criminality by Applicant in 1991, and another \nseven incidents over a period 14 years, commencing in 2001 and continuing until 2015. \nThey include a variety of charges, police involvement, court involvement, and sentences. \n                                                          \n41 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nSome charges were dismissed or nolle prossed. With one exception, he admitted the \nallegations, and for that one allegation to which he claimed that he was not formally \ncharged with a crime, the evidence is clear that he was, in fact, convicted of the charge \nand fined $93.73. Applicant\u2019s willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations is \nsuspect, for he routinely ignored the law when he consistently drove a vehicle without a \nlicense, under suspension, or under the influence, for such a lengthy period. That is why \nhe has been identified as a Felony Habitual Traffic Offender \u2013 a designation that still \napplies to him. It appears that such a designation is akin to a probation. Furthermore, \nApplicant admitted that on rare occasions, he operated a vehicle without a valid operator\u2019s \nlicense in emergencies and at other times.  It is troubling that the information pertaining \nto the alleged crimes was offered only through the incomplete FBI information record, \nwithout police reports, or court records. Nevertheless, while the information of criminality \nis of poor quality, it has generally been \u201cadmitted\u201d by Applicant, raising that information to \nthe level of substantial evidence. Accordingly, based on the actions described above, AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(c) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense;  \nand  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. While a substantial period may have \nelapsed since the robbery/assault-related incident occurred in 1991, Applicant\u2019s other \nmore recent criminal behavior commenced in 2001 and continued until at least December \n2015. He is a recidivist, displaying a long pattern of DUS, DUI, and driving without a \nlicense violations, despite periodic police and court involvement. Furthermore, he is still \ndesignated as a Felony Habitual Traffic Offender. Applicant appears to have a good \nemployment record, but without the requested documentation about the DUI program, his \nparticipation in the program, or his successful completion of the program in November \n2017, I am unable to determine if he has actually successfully completed the program.  \n \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, but \nin this instance, the most recent criminal conduct is two years ago. Given his cavalier \nattitude towards laws, rules, and regulations, Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nunder the circumstances, continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is \nset forth in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \n \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is adopted herein. \nEventually, Applicant generally drank 12 12-ounce beers over a three-day weekend, \nevery weekend, or an unspecified amount of alcohol every other day, to feel calm and \nrelaxed. He acknowledged that he became intoxicated monthly. He also acknowledged \nthat he is an alcoholic. His use of alcohol has, directly or indirectly, led to a number of \nincidents that resulted in actions taken by police and court authorities. He was repeatedly \ncharged with some alcohol-related charges \u2013 three DUIs \u2013 as well as more isolated open \ncontainer and violation of ABC law. While some of those charges were reduced or \ndismissed, several charges resulted in convictions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) have been \nestablished, but none of the other conditions have been established. \n \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline also includes several examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that \ncould mitigate trustworthiness concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) partially applies, but none of the remaining conditions apply. Because \nof their relative recency, Applicant\u2019s 2013 and 2015 DUIs are the most significant, as far \nas his trustworthiness review is concerned. Applicant\u2019s behavior, stemming from his \nassociation with alcohol, has not been infrequent, and the circumstances developed do \nnot appear to be unusual. While Applicant now acknowledges his pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, for far too long he seemingly gave lip-service to it. He contends that he has \nbeen abstinent since June 2016. He also claims to have successfully completed various \nalcohol-related programs and that he is currently participating in other alcohol-related \nprograms, but without the requested documentation regarding those programs and his \npurported participation in them, it is impossible to determine what his participation has \nbeen. There is no evidence that he was ever diagnosed by a qualified medical or mental \nhealth professional for alcohol use disorder, and there is no evidence regarding what the \ntreatment recommendations may have been.  \n \nBecause of his lengthy history of maladaptive alcohol use, questions regarding his \nabstinence, and his irregular attendance at AA, there remain significant questions as to \nwhether such maladaptive alcohol use will recur. Nevertheless, Applicant should be \nencouraged to remain abstinent for a much longer period. He has failed to demonstrate \na clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence, and under the \ncircumstances, there remain doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(d) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy \nCode in 2005, and the bankruptcy was discharged in 2007. He claimed that he did not \nunderstand the value of a dollar or what exactly \u201ccredit\u201d meant. That lack of \nunderstanding, coupled with his \u201calcoholism,\u201d left him in a financial hole. Despite the \nbankruptcy discharge and the relative abatement of his financial issues associated with \nthe Bankruptcy Trustee\u2019s rejection of various accounts, within three years, Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems mushroomed once again. In addition to the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, \nthe SOR identified 16 delinquent accounts, totaling approximately $12,275, that had been \nplaced for collection or charged off. There has been no change in the status of a vast \nmajority of Applicant\u2019s accounts that were placed for collection. While many of them were \nunsuccessfully disputed for reasons not explained, nearly all of the accounts remain \nunaddressed and unresolved, as acknowledged by Applicant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(d) have been established. AG \u00b6 19(b) has been partially established because, with a \ncombined annual family income of $200,000, it is unclear why he failed to make more \nprogress with modest or minimum delinquent debts, or if he was simply unwilling to do \nso.  \n\n \n17 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;42 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;43 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) minimally apply, but none of the remaining conditions apply. \nApplicant claimed he hired a credit repair company to assist him in rebuilding his credit, \nessentially by disputing most of the delinquent accounts listed in his credit reports, as well \n                                                          \n42 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n43 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n18 \n                                      \n \nas financial advisors to help him spend his money wisely. As noted above, he failed to \nsubmit documentation to support his claims that a credit repair company had been hired; \nthe identity of that company; what that company had actually done for him or in his behalf; \nthat financial advisors had been hired; the identity of the financial advisors; or what type \nof guidance they had furnished him. Additionally, aside from Applicant\u2019s lack or financial \nknowledge, coupled with his alcoholism, it is unclear how or when his financial problems \nfirst emerged. Although the record remained open, he also failed to furnish a requested \nupdated status of his SOR-related accounts supported by receipts, checks, or letters \nrelated to those debts; and a copy of his repayment plan showing any priority for \naddressing his delinquent accounts.  \nApplicant seemingly took little action to resolve his delinquent SOR-related debts \nuntil after the SOR was issued. He offered no documentation to indicate that he sought \ninformation from his creditors or collection agents,44 or by obtaining financial counseling \nand credit resolution guidance and assistance. He made arrangements with the state tax \nauthority regarding tax liens that were not alleged in the SOR, and there is evidence that \nhe satisfied those liens. But, with a healthy combined annual income, he could not \nmotivate himself to pay off delinquent debts of $80, $85, $90, $125, or $171. The few \nrelatively modest medical accounts were not resolved until six months after the SOR was \nissued and two months before the hearing was conducted. Applicant offered substantial \nevidence to indicate that his combined annual income is excellent, but little evidence to \nindicate that his financial situation is now under better control, especially considering his \ncomment that \u201cwe have a ton of bills.\u201d Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.45 \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, with minor \nexceptions, Applicant\u2019s promises have not transitioned into positive action. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n44 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. \n \n45 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n19 \n                                      \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise trustworthiness \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, alcohol consumption, and \nfinancial considerations are adopted herein. At the time Applicant completed his e-QIP in \nJanuary 2017, he concealed and omitted DUIs from 2012 and 2015; and denied having \nfinancial issues, although there were numerous delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n20 \n                                      \n \ncomments provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions were deliberate \nfalsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or merely inaccurate answers that were the result of \noversight or misunderstanding of the true facts on his part. Proof of incorrect answers, \nstanding alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when \nthe falsification or omission occurred. As an administrative judge, I must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the alleged \nfalsifications or omissions occurred. I have considered the entire record, including \nApplicant\u2019s initial and subsequent comments.46 Applicant\u2019s explanations for his \nsubmissions, in my view, are simply not persuasive evidence of Applicant\u2019s actual intent. \nIn addition, aside from his lack of candor with respect to the QIP, there is Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy history of criminality. As to the deliberate falsifications on the e-QIP regarding the \npolice record and financial record, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (a) and 16(c) have been established. As to \nthe combined criminal conduct and alcohol consumption allegations, AG \u00b6 16 (c) has \nbeen established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nNeither of the conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s lengthy criminal history continued until \nat least December 2015; his pattern of maladaptive alcohol use continued until at least \nJune 2016; and his false responses to the e-QIP inquiries occurred in January 2017. \nApplicant was confronted with the true facts by an investigator in March 2017, but before \nthat interview, he apparently made no efforts to correct the omissions, concealments, or \nfalsifications. Far from being infrequent, Applicant\u2019s maladaptive alcohol use was routine \n                                                          \n46 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden \nof persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). See also ISCR Case No. 08-05637 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010) (noting an applicant\u2019s level of \neducation and other experiences are part of entirety-of-the-record evaluation as to whether a failure to \ndisclose [significant facts] on an application was deliberate).  \n \n\n \n21 \n                                      \n \nfor decades, and his attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations also lasted for a lengthy \nperiod. Furthermore, three DUIs and multiple DUSs and driving without a license, while \nmisdemeanors, are not minor offenses, and his continuing designation as a Felony \nHabitual Traffic Offender, is also not insignificant. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.47 \n \n There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a \n46-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving, first as the manager, web \nbusiness, and currently as an application systems developer, with his current employer \nsince May 1999. He is a high school graduate, with some college credits, but no degree. \nHe has been occupying a position of public trust since 1999. Applicant is married, and \nhas three children. He is a grandfather. Applicant has purportedly made efforts to remove \nhimself from the clutches of alcohol, and he claims that he has been abstinent since June \n2016. \n \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a self-proclaimed alcoholic, and a justice-involved individual whose history of \ncriminal conduct took place with one incident of criminality in 1991, and another seven \nincidents over a period 14 years, commencing in 2001 and continuing until 2015. His \nfinances are in disarray, with one bankruptcy under Chapter 13 discharged in 2007; and \na renewed history of delinquent accounts that still remain unaddressed by him, despite a \n                                                          \n47 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n22 \n                                      \n \ncombined annual income of approximately $200,000. Although he claimed to have taken \ncertain positive actions to address his creditors and delinquent accounts; and attended \ncertain programs associated with his consumption of alcohol, Applicant failed to submit \nrequested documentation to support his various claims and contentions.  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:48 \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a poor track record of debt reduction and elimination \nefforts, essentially failing to address most of his SOR-related debts. Overall, the evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nposition of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe trustworthiness concerns arising from his criminal conduct, alcohol consumption, \nfinancial considerations, and personal conduct.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nHistory of Case\nOn January 31, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The\naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD) 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n03/22/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 10, 2018, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on January 9, 2019, and was scheduled for hearing on\nFebruary 14, 2019. A hearing was convened as scheduled, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no \nexhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 26, 2019.\n     \nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with an updated psychological\nevaluation. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to supplement the\nrecord. Department Counsel was afforded two days to respond. Within the time\npermitted, Applicant submitted an email explanation from his facility security officer\n(FSO) of her understanding of Applicant\u2019s mental health condition, while crediting him\nwith being a true patriot. Applicant\u2019s submission was admitted as AE A without\nobjection.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline I, Applicant allegedly (a) was diagnosed with Bipolar Affective\nDisorder in about February 2010 and failed to follow his prescribed treatment plan by\ndiscontinuing a prescribed medication and (b) was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder,\nsevere, with anxious distress, with mood-congruent psychotic features, in full remission,\nin about January 2018, and with a prognosis considered to be guarded due to a lack of\npersonal insight into his symptoms and his non-compliance with his primary care\nphysician\u2019s recommendation that he reestablish care with a psychiatrist.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\n1.a, but denied the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b. He claimed to have discontinued\nhis treatment in 2010 for two reasons: The medication was making him uncomfortable\nand he lacked confidence in his provider. He claimed that he found another provider,\nwith the help of his primary provider, whom he was closer to and better connected with,\nwho prescribed more soothing medication. He further claimed that this second doctor\nlater shut down his practice due to a lawsuit. \nApplicant claimed in his response that he went back to his primary provider for\nguidance in finding a new psychiatrist, and that he found a new psychiatrist who treated\nhim for one session before moving on. He claimed that he has a new provider\nscheduled that he is scheduled to see in July 2018.\nApplicant acknowledged having some physical ailments from sports, coaching,\nindustry, and construction, and sometimes suffers from lower back pain in the L-5 area.\nHe claimed that when he would cease using prescribed medication for his Bipolar\ndisorder, his nerve inflation would subside. And he claimed that he experienced\ndifficulties connecting with his provider and convincing him of his reported experiences\n2\n\nwith his medications. Applicant reported in his response hat he suffered frm Guillen-\nBarre Syndrome in 1984 that affected his ability to physically function.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 63-year-old janitor floor specialist who seeks a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted allegations are adopted as relevant and material findings. \nAdditional findings follow.\nBackground\nAppellant married in August 1980 and has two adult children from this marriage.\n(GE 1) He attended an accredited college between 1974 and 1978, but did not earn a\ndiploma. While an undergraduate student, he played varsity baseball. Applicant\nreported no military service. \nSince July 2008, Applicant has worked for his current employer. (GE 1) Between\nMarch 2000 and December 2000, he  worked for other employers. He has worked\ncontemporaneously for another employer since May 2011 as an inventory control\nspecialist, and between July 2008 and January 2011, he was self-employed. (GE 1)\nApplicant\u2019s mental health history  \nApplicant presents with a lengthy history of mental health issues. (GEs 2-3) In\nFebruary 2010, he was referred to a mental health provider to assess his mental health\nsymptoms. (GE 2; Tr. 54) After taking personal information from Applicant, Dr. A (a\nlicensed psychiatrist) entered an uncertain diagnosis, but suspected Bipolar Affective\nDisorder. (GE 2) At this time, Dr. A offered Applicant a trial of anti-psychotic medications\n(Lamictol and Lithium in various doses) and scheduled him for a return visit in March\n2010. (GE 2) Dr. A\u2019s notes document that Applicant consulted with him on five\noccasions between February 2010 and April 2011. (GEs 2-3) While Applicant did not\nsee Dr. A after his last visit in April 2011, he continued to take his prescribed\nmedications for several months thereafter before he ceased altogether. (GEs 2-3; Tr.\n32-34) \nWith the help of his primary medical provider, Applicant engaged another mental\nhealth provider, who he was closer to and better connected with. Between Fall 2013\nand January 2015, Applicant consulted with Dr. B (a licensed psychiatrist) on several\noccasions during this time frame. Dr. B prescribed a different medication: Depakote\n(100 mg). (GEs 2-3; Tr. 33-34, 61-62) He ceased seeing Dr. B after learning that Dr. B\nretired after being sued by a patient and losing his license in 2015. (GE 2; Tr. 62)\nThroughout most of 2015, Applicant continued to take his prescribed Depakote\nintermittently with the advice of another recommended mental health provider (Dr. C),\nwhom Applicant consulted with on only one occasion in 2018.  (Tr. 66) For over two\nyears (2016-2018) Applicant did not consult with a mental health provider or take his\nprescribed Depakote or any other medications designed to address any experienced\nBipolar symptoms on more than an intermittent basis. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 62-63, 66-67)  Only\n3\n\nthrough the influence of his daughter did Applicant return to his medications\nintermittently. (Tr. 63-64)\nIn January 2018, Applicant was referred by the DOD CAF to Dr. D (a licensed\npsychiatrist) for a mental health evaluation. (GE 3) After taking psychiatric history from\nApplicant, Dr. D conducted a mental health examination of him. (GE 3) Results of Dr.\nD\u2019s personality assessment revealed that Applicant answered the questions in a\nmanner where he was trying to portray himself in a positive light that was extreme, even\nfor the evaluative nature of the interview. (GE 3; Tr. 38-39, 62-63) According to Dr. D\u2019s\nobservations, Applicant minimized and denied common shortcomings or minor faults in\na way that likely indicated he was in denial of these issues with little awareness of the\nnegative impact that his actions had on himself or others. (GE 3) Because of Applicant\u2019s\nabnormally high level of minimizing and the defensive nature of his responses, Dr. D\ncould not reliably extrapolate from his assessment any further details. (GE 3)\nBased on his observations of Applicant, Dr. D ruled out Applicant experiencing \nany symptoms of mania. (GE 3) He did, however, draw historical diagnostic impressions\nof Applicant\u2019s experiencing manic episodes, amid reported concerns from Applicant\u2019s\ndaughter about Applicant\u2019s disposition to decompensate quickly if he misses a\nmedication dosage or is non-compliant with his medication regimen. (GE 3) Based on\nhis  diagnostic impressions of Applicant, Dr. D diagnosed him with Bipolar I Disorder,\nsevere, with anxious distress, with mood-congruent psychotic features, in full remission. \n(GE 3)\nDr. D, in turn, assigned a prognosis of Applicant that the latter\u2019s viability to hold a\nsecurity clearance is dependent on his ability to be fully compliant and stable on an\neffective medication regimen. (GE 3) Based on Dr. D\u2019s review and understanding of the\navailable medical documentation, collateral information gained, and Applicant\u2019s own\nadmission, it was clear to Dr. D that Applicant did not fully grasp the consequences of\nhis previous episodes and that his compliance is due to family pressure rather than\npersonal insight, awareness building, and a desire to prevent further episodes or the\nconsequences that they cause. (GE 3) \nDr. D Is on record in expressing particular concern about Applicant\u2019s past\nunwillingness to promptly follow up on his primary care provider\u2019s recommendation to\nreconnect with a psychiatrist, which, in Dr. D\u2019s judgment, calls into question his\ncommitment to the treatment plan. Noting few safeguards in place to guarantee or\naccurately predict whether Applicant\u2019s current stability is sustainable, Dr. D determined\nthat Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to safeguard or handle\nclassified information is promising, but only if he is compliant with his medications. (GE\n3) \nSince his submitting to a psychological evaluation in January 2018, it remains to\nbe seen how Applicant has complied with his medication regimen. The information he\nprovided at his hearing is very limited and includes no documented notes or records of\nwhat medications he is currently taking and in what doses. While Applicant has engaged\nanother psychiatrist (Dr. C) in July 2018 to help him manage his medications, to date,\n4\n\nhe has seen this mental health provider only once and has not provided any evidence of\na diagnosis, prescribed medications, or prognosis from Dr. C. that could help to assess\nApplicant\u2019s current condition and adherence to his prescribed medications. In the\nmeantime, Applicant continues to self-medicate with Depakote. (Tr. 47-48)\nCharacter references\nApplicant is well-regarded by his facility security officer (FSO) who considers him\na true patriot. (AE A) She expressed awareness of Applicant\u2019s medical condition and, in\nparticular, two episodes she knows of where he \u201cbecame a little unbalanced and both\ntimes he was put on short term disability by his doctor.\u201d (AE A) His FSO acknowledged\nthat had she known what she knows now, she probably would not have wanted to take\nthe risk and put him in for a security clearance. (AE A) No other character references\nwere furnished by Applicant.\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of\nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns. These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n5\n\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  And because all security clearances must be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the\nApplicant.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein\n     \nPsychological Conditions\nThe Concern. Certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can\nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a\ndisorder is not required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A\nduly qualified mental health professional (e.g., a clinical psychologist or\npsychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S.\nGovernment, should be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying\nand mitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including\nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the\nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental\nhealth counseling.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). As with all\nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n6\n\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  Because all security clearances must be clearly consistent\nwith the national interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the Applicant.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a civilian janitor floor specialist who seeks a security clearance. \nSecurity concerns are raised over his past history of diagnosed Bipolar Affective\nDisorder in 2010 and Bipolar 1 Disorder with anxious distress with mood-congruent\npsychotic features in 2018.\nPsychological condition concerns\nSince 2010, Applicant has undergone several mental health evaluation for\nBipolar-related issues with licensed mental health providers: three self-referred (Drs. A-\nB and D), and one directed by Applicant\u2019s command (Dr. C). Applicant\u2019s evaluators all\nreached similar conclusions with their respective diagnoses and prognoses and are\nfully reconcilable. All three psychiatric evaluators found indicia of Bipolar traits of\nlongstanding duration in their assessments of Applicant.\nIn their coverage of Applicant\u2019s background history, Drs. A-B and D found \nevidence of a defect in judgment and reliability in Appellant\u2019s case history without \nconsidering him unsuitable for holding a security clearance, providing he complied with\nhis medication regimens prescribed by his treating mental health providers. See DSM-\nV. For obvious reasons, any loss of mental grasp and judgment in times of stress\nplaces the affected person at some risk to overreactions to stimuli and consequential\nmisjudgments and cannot be discounted. \nFor Applicant, his potential for relapse of symptoms (e.g., mood swings)\nassociated with his Bipolar Disorder with attendant risks of judgment lapses (even if not\nsufficiently developed along any of the DSM-5 classification categories to warrant\nclearly identifiable and calibrated stressors) can create hypothetical potential in the\nopinion of his evaluators for exposing him to security risks to inadvertently compromise\nclassified materials in his custody or control, consistent with the requirements of the\nDSM-V. Based on the recent assessments of Drs. A-C, two disqualifying conditions\ncovered by the psychological conditions guideline are applicable to Appellant\u2019s\nsituation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may\nindicate an emotional, mental, or personalty condition, including, but not limited to,\nirresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic,\nlying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors\u201d:  28(b), \u201can opinion by a duly qualified\n7\n\nmental health professional that the individual has a condition that may impair judgment,\nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d\nBased on the reconciled assessments of Applicant\u2019s recent evaluators (Drs. A-\nC), Applicant may claim some benefits of one of the potentially available mitigating\nconditions covered by Guideline. MC \u00b6 29(b), \u201cthe individual has voluntarily entered a\ncounseling or treatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the\nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a\nduly qualified mental health professional,\u201d is partially applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nWithout more evidence of follow-up treatment and counseling to ensure\nApplicant\u2019s compliance with the medication regimens prescribed for him by Dr. B, and\npossibly Dr. D, full application of any of the potentially available mitigating conditions is\nreserved pending updates of his mental health evaluations. To date, Applicant has not\nprovided any evaluation updates from Dr. D or any other licensed psychiatrist. Nor has\nhe provided probative reassurances of his continued compliance with prescribed\nmedication regimens. Without confirmation of Applicant\u2019s continuing compliance with\nhis prescribed medication regimen, safe predictions cannot be made about his ability to\nwithstand recurrent Bipolar symptoms that can adversely affect his judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness.  \nWhole-person assessment\nBased on a whole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s current judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness, taking into account all of Applicant\u2019s developed personal\nhistories, diagnostic impressions reach by his professional evaluators, diagnoses,\nassessments, and prognoses compiled by the mental health professionals who\nevaluated Applicant, Applicant cannot be reliably predicted at this time to be able to\nsustain the medication compliance that is required to maintain his diagnosed Bipolar\ncondition in remission. \nApplicant is well regarded by his FSO who characterized him as a true patriot.\nBut despite the high praise she extended to him, she could not state with conviction\nthat his current condition could not affect his judgment reliability, and trustworthiness.\nPsychological condition concerns are not mitigated.\nFormal Findings\n   \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE I (PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:\n              Against Applicant\n8\n\nConclusions\n        In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2000, and took additional college courses from January 2003 until November 2005. He did not receive an additional degree. He married the first time in 1980, had one child, and divorced in 1985. He married again in 1985 and had four children. Applicant and his wife separated briefly a number of times in their marriage and now have been separated since 2015. Applicant and his wife are trying to reconcile. He has four adult children from this marriage. Since separating from his wife, Applicant rented the basement of a town house where he and his special needs son reside.

Davis, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not provide sufficient documentary evidence to mitigate all financial, \nalcohol, and criminal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 18, 2016 (Government Exhibit (GX) 1), and March 29, 2012 (GX 3), to \nobtain a security clearance required for a position with a defense contractor. He was \ngranted access to classified information after submission of the 2012 e-QIP. However, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the affirmative findings required to \ncontinue his eligibility for access to classified information after he submitted his 2016 e-\nQIP. On June 28, 2017, DOD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns for alcohol consumption (Guideline G), criminal conduct (Guideline J), \nand financial considerations (Guideline F). DOD amended the SOR on October 17, \n2017, to more clearly outline the allegations under Guidelines G and J. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n12/17/2018\n\n2 \n \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the Department of \nDefense on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the original SOR on July 19, 2017. He admitted the four \nfinancial allegations under Guideline F. He answered the amended SOR on October 25, \n2018, admitting the two allegations of alcohol consumption under Guideline G and the \none allegation of criminal conduct under Guideline J. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on the original allegations on October 23, 2017, and the case was \nassigned to me April 13, 2018. DOD issued a notice of hearing on September 4, 2018, \nfor a hearing on September 19, 2018. Unfortunately, Applicant\u2019s mother passed away \non the day of the hearing. A new notice of hearing was issued on September 19, 2018, \nfor a hearing on November 1, 2018. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. \nDepartment Counsel introduced 17 documents which were admitted into the record \nwithout objection as Government Exhibits (GX) 1 to 17. Applicant introduced five \ndocuments admitted into the record without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AX) A to E. I \nkept the record open for Applicant to introduce additional documents. Applicant timely \nsubmitted six documents that I admitted without objection as AX F to K. (GX 18, e-mail, \ndated December 3, 2018) DOHA received a copy of the hearing transcript on November \n9, 2018. The record closed on December 3, 2018, upon receipt of all post-hearing \ndocuments.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 62 years old. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2000, and took \nadditional college courses from January 2003 until November 2005. He did not receive \nan additional degree. He married the first time in 1980, had one child, and divorced in \n1985. He married again in 1985 and had four children. Applicant and his wife separated \nbriefly a number of times in their marriage and now have been separated since 2015. \nApplicant and his wife are trying to reconcile. He has four adult children from this \nmarriage. Since separating from his wife, Applicant rented the basement of a town \nhouse where he and his special needs son reside. (Tr. 25-26, 35-38) \n \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the Army from March 1975 until April 1995. He \nretired as a First Sergeant (E-8) with an honorable discharge. After leaving active duty, \nhe served as a minister for three years until approximately 2000. In February 2002, he \nstarted working with his present defense contractor employer as a mechanic. He was \ncontinually promoted and has been a production supervisor for the last ten years. \nApplicant\u2019s employer has been very supportive of him while he undergoes substance \nabuse rehabilitation, to care for his son, and the need to care for and bury his mother. \n(Tr. 26-27; 33-36; GX 1, e-QIP, dated June 18, 2016; GX 3, e-QIP, dated March 29, \n2012) \n \nThe SOR alleges four financial security concerns under Guideline F; a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy filed in November 2016 with debts discharged in March 2017 (SOR 1.a); a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy filed in July 2016 but dismissed in December 2016 (SOR 1.b); \n\n3 \n \nfederal income tax debt of approximately $45,773 for tax years 2009, and 2011 to 2015 \n(SOR 1.c); and a failure to file in a timely fashion federal tax returns for tax years 2009 \nthrough 2015 (SOR 1.d). Delinquent student loans are not alleged in the SOR as \nfinancial security concerns but are noted on credit reports (GX 4, dated May 9, 2017; \nGX 5, dated August 19, 2016; GX 6, dated September 2, 2014; and GX 7, dated April 3, \n2012). \n \nThe SOR alleges under alcohol consumption (Guideline G) that Applicant in \nOctober 2011 discharged a firearm from a moving vehicle after consuming alcohol. He \nwas sentenced to be incarcerated for 180 days with 165 days suspended. (SOR 2.a). \nThe SOR also alleges that after consuming alcohol Applicant was arrested for \nrecklessly handling a firearm, swearing in public and public intoxication. He was \nsentenced to probation for 12 months. (SOR 2.b) These offenses were also cross-\nalleged as criminal conduct. (SOR 3.a) Applicant admitted all allegations. (Answer to \nSOR, dated October 25, 2018) \n \nApplicant lived beyond his means while on active duty. He used credit cards sent \nto him in the mail to bolster his ability to purchase whatever he wanted. After leaving \nactive duty in 1995 and working as a minister, Applicant continued to have financial \nproblems caused by lack of sufficient income and living beyond his means. In 1997, \nApplicant and his second wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in an attempt to save their \nhouse. They were unable to make the required payments to the bankruptcy trustee, so \nthe bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their debts at the time were \ndischarged in the bankruptcy in 1997. His house was foreclosed in 2002. (Tr. 20-21, 35-\n37; GX 8 and 9, Bankruptcy Documents, 1997; GX 10, Foreclosure documents, dated \nMay 3, 2002; GX 11, Applicant\u2019s Statement, dated May 16, 2002) \n \nApplicant and his wife continued to have financial issues. They moved so he \ncould have a better job, but his wife could not find employment to provide sufficient \nincome for the family. He could not afford to buy a house so he rented one. Applicant\u2019s \nwife usually calculated, completed, and filed their tax returns. After a separation in \napproximately 2006 from his wife, Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns for \nsix years from approximately 2009 until 2015 because he knew he would owe about \n$6,000 each year in taxes that he could not afford to pay. His wife continued to file \nseparately. Starting in 2008, Applicant knew he would owe substantial federal taxes. He \nwas overwhelmed by his problems and did not focus on what he needed to do and did \nnot take care of his business. (Tr. 40-41, 73-75) \n \nIn 2012, Applicant went to a tax service and an attorney to resolve his taxes to no \navail. Starting in 2012, Applicant\u2019s pay was garnished by the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS). After the IRS pay garnishment, Applicant\u2019s take-home pay was reduced to \napproximately $600 a month after garnishment. Applicant\u2019s car was repossessed, and \nhe and his family were evicted from the home they rented. Applicant and his wife \nseparated permanently in 2015. In 2016, Applicant was able to have a tax preparer file \nhis past-due tax returns. Applicant has continued to use this attorney to file his taxes. \n(Tr. 41-43) \n\n4 \n \nApplicant also contacted an attorney, and Applicant and his wife filed another \nChapter 13 bankruptcy that was later converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their debts \nwere again discharged in 2017. (Tr. 21-23, 43-45; GX 2, Bankruptcy Documents)   \n \nApplicant was overwhelmed by his financial issues and the need to care for his \nspecial needs son. After the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant worked with a Certified \nPublic Accountant (CPA) to resolve the federal tax debt that remained from the \nbankruptcy discharge. With the help of the CPA, Applicant was able to have his \ndisabled son declared his dependent and his income restructured to minimize his tax \nliability. Instead of owing taxes, he received a tax refund that is applied to his tax debt. \nHis mother, who was located in another state, became sick and Applicant had to travel \nto help care for her. His mother passed away in September 2018. (Tr. 23-25, 35-38) \n \nApplicant filed his past-due federal tax returns in 2016. (AX F, G, and H, IRS Tax \nDocuments). He timely filed his 2016 and 2017 federal tax returns. (AX I and J, IRS Tax \nDocuments) After all of the tax returns were filed, the IRS determined that Applicant \nowed approximately $35,000 in back taxes. In April 2018, Applicant agreed to a \npayment plan of $425 a month with the ISR to pay back taxes. His payment amount will \nincrease in April 2019 to $595. No taxes were owed for tax years 2016 and 2017. He is \ncurrent with the IRS payment plan for past-due taxes for tax years 2010 to 2015. (Tr. \n49-52, 72-74) \n \nApplicant drank alcohol from approximately 1990 to 2000. He started drinking \nbecause he was a young soldier and just wanted to drink alcohol. He stopped drinking \nalcohol in 2000 because he entered the ministry becoming a pastor and did not want to \nbe seen consuming alcohol. He started drinking again in 2003 because he left the \nministry and there was no accountability for behavior, he was still having financial \nproblems, and he had lost his home. In 2010, his consumption of alcohol increased \nsubstantially for no reason except he and his wife were separated; his children had \nmoved back into his house; and he had issues caring for his mother who was in another \nstate. He was consuming from six to nine beers a day. He drank to deal with his \nproblems and his stress. Applicant sought substance abuse counseling. In 2015, he \nstarted to consult with a psychologist who he still periodically sees.  He last consumed \nalcohol on September 22, 2018, the day before his mother\u2019s funeral. The day before the \nhearing, he started a Veteran\u2019s Affairs (VA) Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program \n(SARP) through his employer. He understands he has an issue with alcohol and needs \ntreatment. He stated that he does not intend to consume alcohol in the future. (Tr. 51-\n58, 75-78: AX A through D; VA Hospital staff assignments and schedule) \n \nIn October 2011, Applicant was separated from his wife and dating another \nwoman. He was consuming a few beers before the woman asked him to take her and \nher young daughter to run some errands. Since he had been drinking alcohol, he asked \nthe woman to drive. Applicant brought a handgun with him because the jurisdiction \nwhere they were located allowed the open carrying of handguns. Applicant and the \nwoman argued and Applicant became irritated. As they drove down a road, Applicant \nfired his gun out the window of the moving car. He apologized to the woman and gave \n\n5 \n \nher his gun. But she drove to a store to call the police. Applicant did not consider \nhimself intoxicated but he knew he was over the legal limit to drive. Applicant was \nconvicted of two counts of brandishing a weapon, served seven days in jail, and placed \non probation for six months. He completed the period of probation. He was monitored \nfor substance abuse while on probation. All tests were negative. (Tr. 59-65, 79-8; GX \n12, Police Report; GX 13, Court Record; GX 16, Incident Report; GX 17, Criminal \nHistory Report) \n \nApplicant had another incident with a weapon in 2015. By September 2015, his \nmother, who had been living with him, moved back to her home because Applicant was \nunable to care for her. Applicant also had problems with his special needs son, and the \nIRS was questioning him about his failure to file tax returns. Applicant was angry and \nfrustrated. He went outside and fired his gun into the air three times. On the day of the \nincident, Applicant consumed over a pint of alcohol. He was arrested and charged with \nreckless handling of a firearm and public intoxication. He was convicted and sentenced \nto twelve months of supervised probation. He wore an ankle bracelet from October 2015 \nuntil October 2016. He did not consume alcohol and successfully completed probation. \nHe no longer owes a firearm. However, he has continued to consume moderate \namounts of alcohol since ending his probation in October 2016. (Tr. 65-70, 80-81; GX \n14, Police Report; GX 15, Court Record; GX 16, Incident Report; GX 17, Criminal \nHistory Report)  \n \nApplicant presented a letter from a friend who is a psychologist and has known \nApplicant for over 25 years. The friend provided mentoring and counseling for Applicant. \nApplicant has been candid and transparent about the issues he has encountered \nincluding the death of his mother. He believes Applicant has taken the counseling he \nreceived to heart and is developing positive coping methods. He is resolving his \nfinancial issue and making restitution. He is taking strides to correct his past mistakes \nand entered substance abuse treatment. He is making efforts to reconcile with his wife. \nThe friend recommends that he be granted eligibility for access to classified information.  \n(AX E, Letter, dated October 31, 2018) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the Administrative Guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n6 \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations \nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. An individual \nwho is financially irresponsible, may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in \nhis obligations to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in \none aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects \nof life. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18).  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his or her creditors is a private matter until evidence \nis uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to meet financial obligations. \nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk inconsistent \nwith the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is required to manage his or her \nfinances in such a way as to meet financial obligations.  \n\n7 \n \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy in July 2016 and his debts were discharged in \nMarch 2017. Applicant admits that he has an income tax debt to the United States of \napproximately $35,000 because he did not file income tax returns for six years for tax \nyear 2009 through 2015. This information is sufficient to raise security concerns under \nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19: \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or pay annual Federal., state, or local income taxes as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax debt caused by his failure to timely file federal tax returns exhibits \nan inability and unwillingness to satisfy debts and meet financial obligations. Once the \nGovernment has established the adverse financial issue, the Applicant has the \nresponsibility to refute or mitigate the issue. Based on the information provided by \nApplicant, I considered the following Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible sources, such as a non-profit credit counselling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n\n8 \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions only partially apply. Applicant presented no evidence \nthat he received financial counseling. However, an individual must establish that they \ncompleted a required financial counseling course for debts to be discharged in \nbankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a permissible and legal method of resolving debt, but it does \nnot show for security clearance purposes a good-faith effort to resolve debts. Applicant \nfiled a bankruptcy action in 2016 and his debts were discharged in 2017. The available \nevidence shows that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2016 that was \nconverted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2016. Applicant\u2019s debts were \ndischarged in March 2017. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy action in 2016/2017 does not equate \nto a security concern.  \n \n \nThe information provided by Applicant shows that he has now filed the tax \nreturns and his tax debt is being resolved. However, there is a more fundamental issue \nfor security clearance purposes in not timely filing tax returns. Applicant admits he did \nnot timely file his federal tax returns because he did not have the funds to pay the taxes. \nThe lack of funds to pay taxes does not relieve a person from timely filing tax returns. \nApplicant\u2019s lack of action to file the returns resulted in his financial problems being \nongoing and recent, and not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely.  \n \nApplicant has shown his recent good-faith efforts to meet his tax and financial \nobligations by agreeing to a payment plan with the IRS. Good faith means acting in a \nway that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty and \nobligation. Applicant must act responsibly given his circumstances, and show that he \nhas a reasonable plan to resolve financial problems, and that he has taken significant \naction to implement that plan. Applicant\u2019s plan must show a systematic method of \nhandling financial obligations, and a meaningful track record of filing tax returns and \nresolving debts. A meaningful track record of tax return filing and resolving debt can be \nestablished by evidence of actually filing tax returns and establishing a plan to pay \ndebts. A promise to file tax returns and pay debts is not a substitute for a track record of \nfiling returns in a timely manner and acting in a financially responsible manner.  \n \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence that he filed his federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2009 through 2015 in 2016. All of these tax returns were filed late and not when \ndue. Failure to timely file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. It is well known that \nfederal tax returns for a particular tax year are to be filed by April 15 of the following \nyear. Voluntary compliance with government rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified and sensitive information. A person who fails to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligation to timely file tax returns does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required for a grant of access to classified or sensitive \ninformation. An applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns is a strong indication that the \nindividual may not follow the rules and guidance concerning safeguarding classified and \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nApplicant is now paying his past-due taxes, so AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. Even though \nApplicant has corrected the tax return problem and is paying his past-due taxes, there \n\n9 \n \nmust still be careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in view of his \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility by failing to timely file income tax \nreturns. Applicant did not timely file his tax returns because he did not have the funds to \npay the taxes due. There are procedures available to a taxpayer to file tax returns even \nif they do not have the funds available to pay the taxes. Applicant did not follow the \nestablished government rules and procedures and contact federal tax authorities for \nhelp to understand the actions he must take. He just simply failed to file the tax returns. \nBy failing to timely file federal tax returns for at least six years, Applicant did not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons \ngranted access to classified or sensitive information  \n \n \nIt is a requirement of good citizenship to timely file income tax returns. The fact \nthat he did not timely file returns indicates that Applicant was not acting responsibly and \nreliably. Applicant did not provide sufficient assurance that his tax filing problems are \nresolved, under control, and will not recur in the future. His lack of reasonable and \nresponsible actions towards his tax returns are a strong indication that he may not \nprotect and safeguard classified or sensitive information. Under all these circumstances, \nApplicant failed to mitigate financial security concerns.  \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption is a security concern because it often leads to \nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21)  \n \nApplicant was arrested for two incidents of firing a weapon after consuming \nalcohol in dangerous circumstances within four years. Available evidence shows \nApplicant continues to consume alcohol. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests, and his \ncontinued consumption of alcohol are sufficient to establish the following Alcohol \nConsumption Disqualifying Condition under AG \u00b6 22(a) (Alcohol-related incidents away \nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, \ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder).  \n \n \nI considered the following Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 \n23: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of action taken to overcome this problem, and has \n\n10 \n \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program. \n \nWhile there is no \"bright line\" rule for determining when conduct is recent or \nsufficient time has passed since the incidents, a determination whether past conduct \naffects an individual's present reliability and trustworthiness must be based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of \ntime has passed without evidence of an alcohol issue, there must be an evaluation \nwhether that period of time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto indicate a finding of reform or rehabilitation.  \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of two incidents of criminally firing a weapon after \nconsuming alcohol in 2011 and 2015. Applicant stated that he entered a VA substance \nabuse program the day before the hearing. He also admitted that he continues to \nconsume alcohol.  \n \n \nApplicant has not presented sufficient evidence to establish a pattern of \nabstinence and has not shown sufficient evidence of action taken to overcome his \nalcohol consumption problems. He did not present any evidence of participation in on-\ngoing programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. He admits that he has and continues to \nconsume alcohol. Accordingly, Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence to show \na change of circumstance. He has not established that he can now control his alcohol \nconsumption impulses. The evidence does not show that Applicant has been reformed \nor rehabilitated. I find that Applicant has not mitigated security concerns for alcohol \nconsumption. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations (AG \u00b6 30). Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal \nconvictions were verified by criminal justice reports. Applicant admits that alcohol \nconsumption was a cause of his criminal activity gun offenses. These criminal acts raise \nthe following Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conductions under AG \u00b6 31: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(b) allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether \nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \n \nI considered the following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 32: \n \n\n11 \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has been involved in weapons-\nrelated criminal activity in 2011 and 2015. These offenses did not happen under \nunusual circumstances, and the last offense happened only approximately three years \nago. Since Applicant still is consuming alcohol, the offenses may likely recur. There was \nno pressure to commit any of the offenses, and they appear to be voluntary. The only \nevidence of rehabilitation is the potential passage of a few years and Applicant no \nlonger having a gun. The evidence of criminal conduct adversely affects Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and leads to the conclusion that he cannot or \nwill not comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant has not presented sufficient \ninformation to mitigate criminal conduct security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the opinion of \nApplicant\u2019s friend that Applicant faced many challenges in recent years leading to his \nalcohol issues and financial problems. Applicant admitted his alcohol-related offenses \nand his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s conduct in failing to timely file his income tax \n\n12 \n \nreturns coupled with two criminal incidents of the wrongful discharge of a firearm after \nconsuming alcohol show irresponsible conduct and poor judgment. Overall, these facts \nleave me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and eligibility and suitability for access to classified information. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated alcohol consumption, \ncriminal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In a response signed on September 5, \n2015, and supplemented between September 11, 2015, and September 15, 2015, he \nadmitted four of the five allegations raised. He also requested a determination based on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing. In the interim, Applicant\u2019s employer ceased \nsponsoring Applicant for a security clearance in 2014 due to downsizing, thereby \neliminating this body\u2019s jurisdiction over the matter.  \nIn early 2018, Applicant was rehired by the same entity and again sponsored for \na security clearance, so processing of this case resumed. 1  On February 26, 2018, the \nGovernment issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) with six attachments (\u201cItems\u201d). \nApplicant\u2019s March 26, 2018, response to the FORM was received on April 4, 2018, and \naccepted into the record without objection. The case was assigned to me on May 17, \n2018. A request to introduce supplemental material was made by Applicant. After the \n1 This action was taken was considered under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n04/06/2018\n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nGovernment expressed no objection, a recommendation on Applicant\u2019s behalf was \naccepted into the record on September 6, 2018. The record was then closed. Based on \nmy review of the case file and submissions, I find Applicant failed to mitigate security \nconcerns. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice  \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Afghanistan) and The Russian Federation \n(Russia). With no objection to the inclusion of these materials, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained within those requests. Selected facts from \nthose sources are reflected below.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Findings of Fact \n \nAfghanistan \n \nAfghanistan is an Islamic Republic with a directly elected president, a bicameral \nlegislative branch, and a judicial branch. Afghanistan remains an important partner with \nthe United States against terrorism. Afghanistan works with the U.S. to eliminate the \nremnants of al-Qaeda and its affiliates. The U.S. continues to invest U.S. resources to \nhelp Afghanistan improve its security, governance, institutions and economy. The \nUnited States\u2019 strong bilateral relationship with Afghanistan is guided by the Enduring \nStrategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) between Afghanistan and the United States \nsigned in May 2012, which lays out economic and political commitments, as well as by \nthe 2014 Bilateral Security Agreement, which lays out mutual security understandings. \nIn July 2012, Afghanistan was designated a Major Non-NATO ally.  \n \nThe U.S. has engaged in on-going conflicts in Afghanistan since 2001. While \nthere has been a drawdown in the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, troops now \ntrain Afghan forces. U.S. forces continue to disrupt and degrade al-Qaeda and Islamic \nState activities in Afghanistan through partnered operations with Afghanistan, as well as \nunilateral operations. It is a U.S. priority to rid Afghanistan of terrorism.   \n \nThe U.S. Department of State, however, issued a travel advisory warning U.S. \ncitizens not to travel to Afghanistan because of continued instability and threats by \nterrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. Afghanistan also has significant human \nrights problems to include extrajudicial killings by security forces, ineffective government \ninvestigations of abuse and torture by local security forces, poor prison conditions, \narbitrary arrest and detention, and judicial corruption. Widespread disregard for the rule \nof law poses a serious problem. (Item 5) \n \nRussia  \n \nRussia has a highly centralized, authoritarian political system led by President \nVladimir Putin. Although \u201c[t]he United States has long sought a full and constructive \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nrelationship with Russia,\u201d current relations between the two old war allies appear to \nhave again turned adversarial. Of note, in August 2017, the President signed into U.S. \nlaw sanctions targeting Russia for, in part, Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. \nelections and Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, including its continuing unlawful \nannexation of Crimea. In 2015, the (former) Director of National Intelligence reported to \nCongress that the leading state intelligence threats to the United States will continue to \ncome from two main countries, one of which is Russia.  \n \nA recent human rights report from the U.S. State Department reflects the \ncommission of significant human rights violations in Russia, including restrictions on \npolitical participation and freedom of expression. It also noted the lack of due process in \npolitically motivated cases (Item 6) \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 61-year-old senior linguist. He first worked for his present employer \nin about 2014. After a brief period of unemployment to due to downsizing, he was again \nemployed as a linguist in approximately July 2016. His commander noted that his \nservices within a specialized area have been \u201cindispensible,\u201d and he lauded Applicant\u2019s \nskills. (Supplemental Response to FORM) Applicant is a dedicated and self-sufficient \nworker. He has received a letter of appreciation from a member of the highest ranks for \nhis commendable enthusiasm, unwavering willingness to perform his duties with such \nhigh caliber, and \u201cselfless generosity and commitment.\u201d (SOR Response, attachment) \nSeveral other letters of appreciation, recommendations, and certificates of appreciation \nwere also submitted by Applicant, reflecting his excellent work performance.  \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Afghanistan. There, Applicant earned both a \nbachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree in engineering before starting a career in general \nconstruction. In 1993, due to the upheaval and danger in Afghanistan, Applicant moved \nhis family to Russia as refugees. There, he leased an electronics store and \u201cworked \nvery hard\u201d to raise the funds to emigrate to the United States in 2004. He left Russia \nwhen he was in his late 40s, first returning the business to its landlord. (SOR Response \nat 2) Applicant and his family, including his wife and six adult children, became \nnaturalized U.S. citizens in early 2010. Applicant honors his oath as a U.S. citizen and is \ncommitted to defending this country.  \n \n \nIn Afghanistan, Applicant left a brother who was a citizen and resident of that \ncountry. The brother passed away in November 2016. (FORM Response) The two had \nnot communicated for a few years before the brother died.  \n \nApplicant has one daughter who came to the United States after he did. She  \nremains a citizen of Afghanistan, is currently a registered alien living in the United \nStates, and has applied for U.S. citizenship. In 2014, she began to suspect that her \nhusband, a citizen of Afghanistan, was using her and their marriage to obtain U.S. \nresidency. (SOR Answer at 2) This son-in-law, a citizen of Afghanistan, was last known \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nto be a U.S. resident.2 The couple divorced in late 2015. Neither Applicant nor his family \nmembers maintain contact with this former in-law. Applicant\u2019s daughter, like four of her \nother siblings, lives near or with Applicant and his wife in the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s sixth child, another daughter, has remained a citizen and resident of \nRussia. She and her husband, who is also a citizen and resident of Russia, have three \nyoung children. In March 2012, Applicant\u2019s wife filed a sponsoring petition on behalf of \nthis daughter, son-in-law, and children to immigrate to the United States. (FORM \nResponse) That petition is still being processed. Applicant maintains bi-weekly contact \nwith his daughter through an Internet program. \n \nApplicant\u2019s Russian kin do not know of Applicant\u2019s work and \u201chave no idea that \n[he] worked [in a capacity aiding the United States].\u201d (FORM Response) Only \nApplicant\u2019s wife knows of Applicant\u2019s work and his place of employment. No family \nmember is in fear due to his work. (FORM Response) Applicant emphatically conveyed \nthat his \u201cfamily members do not represent a cause of divided loyalty\u201d for him, nor can \nthey be used to coerce him into assisting a foreign power. (FORM Response) None of \nhis family members are affiliated with any foreign military or organizations. Applicant \nsends no money to his family members abroad because he has \u201chis own family \nmembers . . . in the U.S. and [he is] working hard to support them, and they are [his] \nfirst and last priorities. . . . \u201c (FORM Response) In 2017, Applicant bought a new home \nin a new state, where his wife and all but his Russian-based child now reside. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under the \nAG, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national interest. In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n                                                          \n2 The SOR allegation at 1.c alleges that Applicant has a son-in-law who is a citizen and resident of \nAfghanistan and is employed by the Afghan Foreign Ministry. This son-in-law now lives somewhere in the \nUnited States. His present employer is unknown. \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. Under the Directive, an applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizen to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nApplicant has natural ties of affection with multiple family members who are \ncitizens of either Afghanistan or Russia, and residents of either Afghanistan, Russia, or \nthe United States. These include or have included Applicant\u2019s brother, two daughters, \nand two sons-in-law. It may be assumed he maintains normal familial attachments with \nhis sibling, daughters, and in-laws. Such contacts could compromise Applicant or his \nkin. I find disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a)-(b) potentially apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, \nand \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides three conditions that could possibly mitigate security concerns:   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interests in favor of \nthe U.S. interests; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nThe presence of terrorism in Afghanistan is well established. Russia\u2019s active \npursuit of U.S. protected information is similarly recognized. Consequently, these \ncountries represent zones of high risk in terms of the security of Applicant\u2019s kin and the \npossibility foreign interests could pursue protected information believed to be in the \npossession of Applicant.  \n \nApplicant has clearly set forth that he is a proud U.S. citizen who is committed to \ndefending this country. He arrived in the United States in 2004 and became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen eight years ago. He lives in this country with his wife, and all but \none of his children also live with him in the United States. As a family unit, they trailed \nalong with Applicant when he moved and purchased a new home in a new state in \n2017. There, they are enjoying the benefits of living in the United States of America. \nApplicant is committed to his life in the United States and to providing a secure and \nfinancially stable home base for his domestic kin. Except for two of his daughters, all of \nApplicant\u2019s children are naturalized United States citizens. \n \nApplicant\u2019s recently divorced daughter who lives in the United States, but retains \nAfghan citizenship, resides with Applicant. She is in the process of becoming a U.S. \ncitizen. The family maintains no relationship with her ex-husband. As for Applicant\u2019s \nbrother in Afghanistan, he passed away in 2016 after a period devoid of communication \nwith Applicant. Applicant has no remaining relations in Afghanistan.  \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nRemaining abroad is the daughter of Applicant who resides in Russia with her \nhusband and three children. While Applicant maintains communication with this \ndaughter every two weeks via the Internet, neither she, her husband, nor any of \nApplicant\u2019s family except Applicant\u2019s wife know of his career or where he works. No \nmoney is sent to the couple in Russia, as Applicant focuses on providing for his \nimmediate family residing with or near him in the United States. Applicant\u2019s wife has \ninitiated sponsorship for the Russian kin to immigrate to the United States. Their status \ntoward that goal is presently pending. None of Applicant\u2019s relations have a nexus with a \nforeign government or organization. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a)-(b) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed in the AG. \nThe final determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person \nanalysis based on the written record. In addition to Applicant\u2019s foreign relations, I \nconsidered factors such as his age, profession, education, and employment history.  \n \nThe facts offered with regard to Applicant\u2019s family members with a nexus to \nAfghanistan and Russia were substantially updated in 2018. Applicant\u2019s brother in \nAfghanistan has been deceased for a couple of years after a period of non-\ncommunication. The first of Applicant\u2019s daughters at issue is now a legal resident of the \nUnited States with an application pending for U.S. citizenship; she has divorced her \nAfghan husband and her family no longer has contact with him. \n \nRemaining at issue is Applicant\u2019s daughter and son-in-law in Russia, the country \nin which Applicant and his family resided for several years as refugees from \nAfghanistan. While Applicant maintains contact with this daughter via the Internet \nregularly, she does not know what he does for a living or where he works. Neither she \nnor her husband has a nexus to a foreign government or military. Applicant\u2019s spouse \nhas submitted sponsorship applications to permit this daughter and her family to \nimmigrate to the United States.  \n \nWhile the Russian kin pose some degree of concern, both Applicant\u2019s expressed \nfeelings and track record reflect that he considers the United States to be his family\u2019s \nseat. There is a demonstrated intent to reassemble his large family in his new state of \nresident. He owns a home large enough to accommodate his family. He is devoted to \nhis work. He uses his income for the betterment of his family in the United States only, \nconsidering those individuals to be of his utmost concern. At the same time, Applicant is \nexceptionally lauded for his translating work in a specific field. His recommendations \nand letters of appreciation are impressive. He is clearly an experienced and valuable \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \naddition to his employer\u2019s mission. Considering all these factors, I conclude Applicant\u2019s \nloyalty to the United States outweighs his loyalties for the Russian family now \nattempting to immigrate to the United States.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 54-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance. He is employed as a fabricator for a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since 2002. He serves as the lead of a fabrication shop located on a U.S. military installation. His educational background includes a high school diploma and about two years of college. He has married and divorced twice, with the last divorce in 2005. He has two adult children from his marriages. His employment history include military service in the U.S. Army from 1981 to 1995. (Tr. 42-47) His service included a year-long deployment for Operations Desert Shield and Storm, as known as the Persian Gulf War or the First Gulf War. The SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of failure to timely file state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2002 through 2013. Applicant does not dispute or contest the allegations. He disclosed that he failed to file state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2005, as a result of his second divorce, in his March 2014 security clearance application. (Exhibit 1) He attributed his tax problems to falling behind on his tax obligations, embarrassment, and inaction.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n \n08/01/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Although he is now in compliance with federal and \nstate tax authorities, his tax problems went on for far too many years to justify complete \nmitigation. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non March 17, 2014. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on December 12, 2014, after reviewing the \napplication and the information gathered during a background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent \nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 16, 2015. He admitted all the \nallegations concerning failure to timely file state and federal income tax returns for a \nnumber of tax years. He also requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was initially processed as a non-\nhearing case in about April 2015, but for reasons that are unclear the case was \nmisplaced or not assigned to an administrative judge or both. (Tr. 15-17) The case \nresurfaced in 2018, Department Counsel contacted Applicant, and he indicated that he \nhad changed his mind and wanted a hearing, which he confirmed in writing on July 9, \n2018.   \n \nThe case was assigned to me on July 12, 2018. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on September 20, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered a single documentary exhibit, which was admitted as Exhibit 1. \nApplicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-X. Other \nthan Applicant, no witnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on \nSeptember 27, 2018. \n \nThe record was kept open until October 5, 2018, and then extended by ten days, \nto provide Applicant an opportunity to present additional documentation concerning his \ntax problems. Those matters were timely received on October 11, 2018, and it is \nadmitted without objections as Exhibit Y.     \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance. He is employed as a fabricator for a company in the defense industry. He \nhas been so employed since 2002. He serves as the lead of a fabrication shop located \non a U.S. military installation. His educational background includes a high school \ndiploma and about two years of college. He has married and divorced twice, with the \nlast divorce in 2005. He has two adult children from his marriages. His employment \nhistory include military service in the U.S. Army from 1981 to 1995. (Tr. 42-47) His \nservice included a year-long deployment for Operations Desert Shield and Storm, as \nknown as the Persian Gulf War or the First Gulf War.   \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of failure to timely \nfile state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2002 through 2013. Applicant \ndoes not dispute or contest the allegations. He disclosed that he failed to file state and \nfederal income tax returns for tax year 2005, as a result of his second divorce, in his \nMarch 2014 security clearance application. (Exhibit 1) He attributed his tax problems to \nfalling behind on his tax obligations, embarrassment, and inaction. (Tr. 30, 47-48) He \ndescribed his situation as follows: \n \nWhat happened at the time was I\u2019d gotten behind in my taxes and owed \nalmost $2,000, which I could not afford and simply got behind in my taxes \nand then felt embarrassed to bring it current. And each year, not having a \nprevious tax return, I just hoped it would not surface or anything. (Tr. 30) \n\n \n3 \n \nHe decided to take action to address his problematic tax situation after completing his \nMarch 2014 security clearance application. (Tr. 31-32)  \n \nApplicant is now in compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. Due to \nage, he was unable to file returns before tax year 2009, but he provided documentary \nproof of filing state and federal tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2017. (Exhibits A-\nY). He explained that he filed the returns periodically due to the cost involved using a \ntax preparer and availability of funds. (Tr. 34-35; Exhibit A) Going forward, his plan is to \nstay current with his tax obligations and never get into a similar situation. (Tr. 36) \n \nConcerning the federal income tax returns, Applicant filed returns as follows: (1) \n2009 past due in April 2014; (2) 2010 past due in April 2014; (3) 2011 past due in \nJanuary 2015; (4) 2012 past due in March 2015; (5) 2013 past due in April 2016; (6) \n2014 timely in March 2015; (7) 2015 timely in April 2016; (8) 2016 past due in July \n2018; and (9) 2017 filed past due in July 2018. (Exhibits G-O) IRS account transcripts \nfor tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 show account balances of $0 for those three years. \n(Exhibits C-F)   \n \nConcerning the state income tax returns, Applicant filed returns as follows: (1) \n2009 past due in April 2014; (2) 2011 past due in January 2015; (3) 2012 past due in \nMarch 2015; (4) 2013 past due in April 2016; (5) 2014 timely in March 2015; (6) 2015 \ntimely in April 2016; (7) 2016 past due in July 2018; and (8) 2017 past due in July 2018. \n(Exhibits P-X) He received a $512 refund from the state tax authority for tax year 2017. \n(Exhibit B; Tr. 21) The state tax authority issued Applicant a certificate of \ncompliance/letter of good standing on September 26, 2018. (Exhibit Y)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required; and  \n                                                          \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nApplicant made good progress in resolving the tax matters, and he is now in \ncompliance with both federal and state tax authorities. That means he has filed all tax \nreturns, as required, and he has paid all taxes due, as required. And he did a good job \ndocumenting his compliance.  \n \n \nIn addressing this issue, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns \nand pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the \nfederal government. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who \nfails repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax \nwhen due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017).  \n \n \nHere, I am concerned about the duration of Applicant\u2019s tax problems and the \ntiming of his remedial action. Applicant failed to timely file state and federal income tax \nreturns for more than a decade. He has been in compliance for a relatively brief period \nof time compared with the time of his noncompliance. It is also noted that both his state \nand federal returns for the last two tax years, 2017 and 2018, were filed past the due \ndate. Considering the totality of facts and circumstances, it is far too soon to tell if he will \ncontinue to meet his tax obligations on a timely basis. Accordingly, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(g) applies, but the evidence is not sufficient to justify complete \nmitigation of his long-standing irresponsibility in failing to meet his legal obligations.    \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility denied.  \n \n \n \nMichael H. Leonard \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Hackett, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the personal conduct and alcohol consumption security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline E, personal \nconduct. Applicant responded to the SOR on May 24, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On August 22, 2018, Department Counsel amended the \nSOR to add an additional allegation under Guideline E and allegations under Guideline \nG, alcohol consumption. Applicant responded to the amended SOR on September 20, \n2018. \nThe case was assigned to me on November 1, 2018. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 14, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for January 23, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nThe Government called two witnesses and submitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 14, which were admitted in evidence without objection.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2014. He served in the U.S. military from 1983 until he \nretired with an honorable discharge in 2003.

When he was interviewed for a background investigation \nin 1987, he stated that he was fined more than $100 for one of the DUIs, but he did not \nrecall the amount of the other fine. At his hearing, he initially testified that he could not \nremember being arrested for DUI during that time period. He eventually conceded that \nhe had been arrested as alleged, but he later again stated that he could not recall \nwhether the incidents occurred. Applicant\u2019s testimony and statements about this and \nother incidents were evasive, inconsistent, and not credible.2 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in May 1988 and charged with drunk driving and \nspeeding by going 49 miles per hour (MPH) in a 35 MPH zone. He pleaded guilty to \nreckless driving, and the speeding offense was dismissed. He paid a $200 fine, and his \nlicense was suspended for 30 days.3 \n \n \nApplicant wrote in his response to the SOR that he \u201cstopped at a local bar that \nserved alcohol, and [he] recall[ed] drinking one beer.\u201d He stated that the drunk driving \ncharge was reduced and \u201cwould have been dismissed if it weren\u2019t for the speed.\u201d He \nadmitted at his hearing that he may have had two or more beers. The military police \nreport of the incident indicates that Applicant failed the field sobriety test and his blood \nalcohol content (BAC) was measured at 12% and 13%. He testified that the BAC may \nhave been affected by his dentures.4 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 73-74, 85-88; GE 1; AE D. \n \n2 Tr. at 103-107, 118-119; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 14.

He paid a \n$71 fine, and the charge was subsequently dismissed. Applicant stated that the police \nwere called after an argument with his wife.5 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in June 2013 and charged with driving while intoxicated \n(DWI), first offense. He pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of reckless driving. He was \nsentenced to 60 days in jail, with all time suspended; probation for 12 months; a \nrestricted driver\u2019s license; and a $500 fine.6 \n \n \nApplicant stated that he had no more than three beers at a baseball game, and \nhe did not think his driving would be impaired. He admitted that his BAC was .09% to \n.10%. When he was interviewed for his background investigation in March 2014, he \nstated that the 2013 arrest was an isolated incident and not part of a pattern of alcohol-\nrelated issues. He denied ever being charged with any other alcohol-related offenses.7 \nHe wrote in his response to the SOR: \n \nDuring my court appearance the prosecution agreed to reduce the charge \nto reckless driving because this was my first and only offense in my entire \ndriving history at the time which was considered as mitigating evidence. \nTherefore, I was officially charged with a lesser charge of reckless driving. \nI plead[ed] guilty and paid the applicable fine. I emphasize that this was \nmy first offense, at that time, in my entire driving history. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not intend to be dishonest, and that he said he had \nonly one alcohol-related driving offense because he thought the investigation was \nlimited to the previous seven years. He also stated that he thought that because the \ncharges had been reduced to reckless driving, they did not count.8  \n  \n \nApplicant was charged in 2014 with the misdemeanor offense of reckless driving: \nimproper brakes. He was found guilty of the lesser offense of improper control/driving. \nApplicant stated that he was reaching for a pair of sunglasses when a car cut in front of \nhim and abruptly stopped. He hit the back of the car. Alcohol was not involved.9 \n \n \nApplicant attended and completed alcohol counseling as a requirement of his \nprobation for the 2013 offense. He stated that he has learned from the experience, he \ndoes not drink to excess, there have been no additional driving offenses, and there will \nbe no additional alcohol-related incidents.10   \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 110-111; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 13. \n \n6 Tr. at 111; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4. \n \n7 Tr. at 111; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n8 Tr. at 107-109. \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n10 Tr. at 114-117, 119-120; GE 2. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant was terminated from a job in 2007 after his employer discovered \nmultiple pornographic files on his network drive. Applicant stated that he was leaving the \ncompany, and he brought in a compact disc (CD) from home to copy some personal \nfiles from his work computer. He mistakenly picked up a CD that had pornography on it. \nHe stated that he did not intentionally place the files on the network drive, and that they \nwere accidentally uploaded to the drive while he was copying other files. He stated that \nhe was terminated the next day, \u201con the same day that [he] had planned to resign.\u201d11 \n \n \nApplicant provided a similar, but slightly different, account of the termination \nduring a January 2009 background interview. He stated that he accidently copied the \npornographic material onto his work computer from a memory stick. He was fired about \ntwo weeks later, and he did not mention that he had already planned to resign.12 \n \n \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor from about March 2013 until his \ncontact was terminated as the result of a layoff in October 2013. In April 2013, he \nviolated policy when he downloaded a file from his personal e-mail account, which \ncontained multiple usernames and passwords for DOD accounts and other personal \naccount information. He received a written reprimand in which he was directed to take \nadditional training, with a warning that if his \u201cfuture activities result in additional security \nincidents, disciplinary action, such as a formal performance action plan or involuntary \nseparation, may follow.\u201d Applicant admitted that he had an Excel spreadsheet with \n\u201cnonworking\u201d old passwords that he used to keep track of old passwords, so that he \nwould not use them again.13 \n  \n \nIn about September 2013, Applicant plugged his personal phone into his work \ncomputer to charge the phone. He immediately removed it when he was told that he \nhad violated security rules.14 \n \n \nApplicant was at a work meeting in about October 2013 when he commented to \nthe person next to him to the effect that if he brought his firearm, he could take out the \nentire leadership or a bomb could do the same. Applicant denied making a threat. He \nmeant the comment to be a precaution about the lack of security in the facility.15 \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded, as reported by two witnesses and various \ndocuments. He is praised for his excellent job performance, work ethic, trustworthiness, \nprofessionalism, and integrity.16 \n                                                          \n11 Tr. at 88-91; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3, 11, 14. \n \n12 GE 14. \n \n13 Tr. at 20-21, 28-29, 74, 77-79, 91-93; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 5, 10; AE E.  \n \n14 Tr. at 93-94; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2.  \n \n15 Tr. at 43-45, 79-82, 96-99; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n16 Tr. at 59-71; AE B, C. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder.  \n \nApplicant was arrested on four occasions for DUI, drunk driving, or DWI. He was \ncharged with public swearing/intoxication in 2007. AG \u00b6 22(a) is applicable.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related offense was in 2013. He attended and \ncompleted alcohol counseling as a requirement of his probation. He stated that he has \nlearned from the experience, he does not currently drink to excess, and there will be no \nadditional alcohol-related incidents. However, Applicant\u2019s testimony about his arrests \nwas inconsistent, contradictory, and not worthy of belief. Without candor, I am unable to \nconclude that the conduct is unlikely to recur.   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI find that Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) is not applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and \n23(d) have some applicability, but they are insufficient to overcome concerns about his \nalcohol-related criminal conduct.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal conduct is cross-alleged under Guideline E. \nThat conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s \nconduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct guidelines. However, the general concerns about questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15 and 16(c) are established for the alcohol-related conduct.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges the 2013 DWI. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges all of the alcohol-related \nconduct, including the 2013 DWI. There is no conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.b that is not also \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.b is \nconcluded for Applicant.  \n \nApplicant violated policy and security rules and procedures in 2007 by having \npornographic files on his network drive; in 2013, when he downloaded a file from his \npersonal e-mail account, which contained multiple usernames and passwords for DOD \naccounts and other personal account information; and again in 2013, when he plugged \nhis personal phone into his work computer. He was charged in 2014 with the \nmisdemeanor offense of reckless driving: improper brakes. He was found guilty of the \nlesser offense of improper control/driving. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and \n16(d) are not perfectly applicable because the conduct is sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under other guidelines. However, the general concerns about \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16(c), and 16(d) are established.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant was removed from his position in October 2013 \nprior to his scheduled end date on the contract after he made threatening comments \ntoward the leadership. That allegation is not established by substantial evidence. SOR \u00b6 \n1.e is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n9 \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nAny one or more of the allegations could be mitigated if they were considered on \ntheir own in a piecemeal basis. However, the number of allegations, combined with \nApplicant\u2019s lack of candor, preclude mitigation. Concerns about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment remain. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and G in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and his excellent character evidence. However, he has \nmultiple alcohol-related driving offenses and work problems, and he cannot be trusted \nto tell the truth. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and alcohol consumption security concerns.  \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant started working for federal contractors in 2000, and she has been consistently employed by federal contractors to present, except for two unemployment periods from October 2015 through June 2016 (nine months), and August 2016 through February 2017 (seven months). Applicant was granted a secret clearance in 2002, which was upgraded to a top-secret clearance in 2004. She has continuously held her clearance eligibility since 2002 to present, except for a period during which it was suspended due to a lack of sponsor. There is no evidence showing any additional security concerns, except for those in the current SOR. Applicant\u2019s October 2015 employment termination apparently was due to disciplinary or performance-related issues.",

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and underemployment contributed to or \naggravated her financial problems. Under her circumstances, she has been responsibly \naddressing her delinquent accounts. With her current earnings, she should be able to \npay for her family\u2019s living expenses and current debts. Her financial problems are being \nresolved. Clearance granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 18, \n2012, seeking to continue the clearance required for her position with a federal \ncontractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) on August 15, 2015, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). She requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \nThe Notice of Hearing (NOH) was issued on December 30, 2015, setting a \nhearing for January 25, 2016. That hearing was cancelled on January 14, 2016, after \nApplicant\u2019s employment was terminated and DOHA lost jurisdiction over her case. \n10/30/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant was rehired by a federal contractor on March 1, 2017. (Tr. 11) Her case was \nreopened as a \u201cpriority case,\u201d and DOHA assigned the case to me on June 7, 2018. A \nnew NOH was issued on June 20, 2018, setting the hearing for June 29, 2018. \nApplicant affirmatively waived her right to 15-days advanced notice of her hearing both \non June 11, 2018, and at her hearing. (See Hearing Exhibit 1; Tr. 11-13) \n \nAt the hearing, the Government offered two exhibits (GE 1 and 2). Applicant \ntestified and submitted two exhibits. (AE 1 and 2) All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 11, 2018. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the August 2015 SOR on June 7, 2018. \nThe amendment requested the striking of SOR \u00b6 1.a, and substituting for it four new \nfinancial specifications: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. Applicant did not object and the \namendment was granted as requested. (Tr. 14-15) The motion to amend the SOR, \ndated June 8, 2018, and Applicant\u2019s answers to the amended SOR, dated June 26, \n2018, were made part of the pleadings and are attached to the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant did not specifically admit or deny any of the SOR \nallegations. However, through her comments, explanations, and the documentary \nevidence provided, she indirectly admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.d). Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR and at her hearing are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, including her testimony \nand demeanor while testifying, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She completed an \nassociate\u2019s degree in December 2006, and is currently working on her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. She has never been married. She has three adult children, ages 26, 22, and 20.  \n \nApplicant started working for federal contractors in 2000, and she has been \nconsistently employed by federal contractors to present, except for two unemployment \nperiods from October 2015 through June 2016 (nine months), and August 2016 through \nFebruary 2017 (seven months). Applicant was granted a secret clearance in 2002, \nwhich was upgraded to a top-secret clearance in 2004. She has continuously held her \nclearance eligibility since 2002 to present, except for a period during which it was \nsuspended due to a lack of sponsor. There is no evidence showing any additional \nsecurity concerns, except for those in the current SOR.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s October 2015 employment termination apparently was due to \ndisciplinary or performance-related issues. (Tr. 34-37) Following her termination, \nApplicant was underemployed or unemployed. During her period of unemployment, \nApplicant took temporary jobs, including a job as a driver. She received unemployment \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbenefits, took loans, and used her credit to pay her living expenses and her children\u2019s \ncollege expenses.  \n \nApplicant explained that between October 2015 and July 2017, her income was \ninsufficient to pay her family\u2019s living expenses, assist her children with their college \nexpenses, and pay her debts. An investment property and her home were about to be \nforeclosed and she had numerous delinquent debts. Applicant sold the investment \nproperty and modified the home mortgage, taking it out of foreclosure and bringing the \nmortgage to current.  \n \nIn July 2017, Applicant\u2019s current employer, a federal contractor, hired her as a \nfinancial manager. Her income went from making $25 an hour, to a yearly salary of \n$115,000. Since July 2017, Applicant has been diligently addressing her delinquent \naccounts, many of which were not alleged in the SOR. Applicant was unable to start \npaying her delinquent accounts any sooner because she was the main breadwinner of \nthe family and her income was insufficient to pay all of their financial obligations at the \nsame time. Applicant had three children attending college. She elected to forego taking \nstudent loans for their children. Instead, she provided financial assistance to them to \nenable them to complete college without loans. \n \nIn her 2012 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had financial problems that \nincluded a delinquent mortgage, delinquent student loans, personal loans in default, and \ndelinquent consumer credit accounts. The SOR alleged four delinquent or charged-off \naccounts. Based on Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence (submitted with the SOR \nresponse), the status of the alleged debts is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a (collection for $1,045). Applicant paid this account in May 2018. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b (charged-off debt for $4,080). Applicant paid $1,025 and decreased \nthe balance from $4,080 to $2,629 in April 2018. She anticipated paying off this debt by \nthe end of 2018. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c (charged-off car loan for $19,302). Applicant paid $1,331 in June \n2018. She established a monthly payment plan. The documentary evidence shows that \nshe decreased the balance from $19,302 to $10,647. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d (charged-off loan for $27,238). Applicant established a payment plan \nand has been paying $455 a month. She decreased the balance from $27,238 to \n$21,333. \n \nApplicant acknowledged that she should have been more diligent paying her \ndelinquent accounts. However, she believes she was doing the best she could do under \nher circumstances. She paid as much of her delinquent accounts as she could to \nbalance the payments of her other debts. She understands the seriousness of the \nsecurity concerns raised by her financial problems. She promised to timely pay her \ndebts in the future. Applicant highlighted her 18 years of employment with federal \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontractors while holding a clearance during most of that period without any issues or \nconcerns, except for his financial problems. Applicant credibly promised to continue \npaying her debts and to resolve her financial problems. She believes that with her \ncurrent income, her financial situation is now stable, and she will be able to maintain her \nfinancial responsibility and eligibility for a clearance. Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling, but she is following a budget. (Tr. 50) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n\n \n5 \n \n \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. She \ndeveloped financial problems around 2016, because she was terminated from her \nposition. Because of her periods of unemployment and underemployment, she acquired \nsubstantial debt. AG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \nand \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \n\n \n6 \n \n \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;1 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nAll of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are raised by the \nfacts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nongoing and recent because she is still paying her delinquent debts. However, her \nfinancial problems occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur and they do not cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \n                                            \n1 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems could be attributed to, or were aggravated by, her \nperiods of unemployment or underemployment with the subsequent decrease in family \nearnings. It is not clear whether Applicant losing her job was due to her own \nmisconduct. Nevertheless, I find that Applicant\u2019s actions after losing her job \ndemonstrate financial responsibility. She took part-time jobs to supplement her \nunemployment income and used her savings and credit to pay for some of her \ndelinquent accounts. \n \n \nThe June 2018 credit report in evidence show 34 trade lines, with only the four \naccounts alleged in the SOR being delinquent. After obtaining full-time employment with \nher current employer in March 2017, Applicant started to address her delinquent \naccounts. She paid off one account and has reduced substantially her debt on the \nremaining three accounts. Applicant also identified as factors that prevented her from \npaying her debts more diligently including her mortgage payments, her financial support \nfor three children attending college, and the necessity to pay other debts and living \nexpenses.  \n \n \nApplicant is making a good-faith effort to resolve her debt. Her actions, although \nrecent, show diligence and responsibility in the handling of her financial obligations. \nApplicant has not received financial counseling, but she is following a budget. She is in \nthe process of addressing her financial obligations in a manner consistent with her \nfinancial resources.  \n \n \nI find that the evidence does not support a finding that she was negligent in the \npayment of her financial obligations. She simply was not able to pay all her debts at the \nsame time. She divided her financial resources between her financial obligations and \nher living expenses in order to provide for her children\u2019s education.  \n \nThe AGs do not require an Applicant to immediately resolve or pay each and \nevery debt alleged in the SOR, to be debt free, or to resolve first the debts alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. Applicant has implemented a plan to resolve \nher financial problems and she has made significant progress implementing her plan. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, and including her recent actions, Applicant \ndemonstrated financial responsibility. She disclosed her financial problems in her 2012 \nSCA. Her financial situation is improving and there are clear indications that her \nfinancial problems are being resolved and are under control. She has been paying her \ndelinquent accounts and promised to continue to do so. Her earnings should be \nsufficient to pay for her family\u2019s living expenses and current debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nfederal contractors since 2000. She has held a clearance during most of her \nemployment without any issues or concerns, except for her financial problems. The \nrecord evidence is sufficient to establish that her financial problems are being resolved \nand are under control.  \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Applicant demonstrated a recent track \nrecord of paying her financial obligations. She is fully aware of the security concerns \nraised by her failure to maintain financial responsibility. She promised to maintain her \nfinancial responsibility. The financial considerations security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest of the United States to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance to Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Cohen, Esq. \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nCurry, Marc, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns generated by his contacts and financial \ninterests in the Philippines. The romantic relationship that he had with a Thai woman \nseveral years ago when he was working in Estonia generates no security concern. As \nfor security concerns under the personal conduct guideline, Applicant did not falsify his \n2012 security clearance application, and his acquaintances who are Filipino natives and \nresidents do not generate personal conduct security concerns. In sum, Applicant has \nmitigated all of the security concerns. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 9, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline E (personal conduct). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on \nSeptember 1, 2006. \n01/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nThe SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the \nGovernment, DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. It recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a \ndetermination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 29, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR, denying all of the \nallegations except 1.d and 1.e, and requested a hearing.1 The case was initially \nassigned to another administrative judge on June 13, 2018, before it was transferred to \nme on September 18, 2018. On September 21, 2018, the hearing was scheduled for \nOctober 5, 2018.  \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel submitted five documents for admission that \nI marked as Government Exhibits (GEs) 1 through 5. Counsel for Applicant objected to \nthe admission of GE 4 and GE 5. I sustained the objection, only admitting GEs 1 \nthrough 3 into the record. Upon reconsideration, I have decided to admit GE 4. \n \nCounsel for Applicant proposed 26 exhibits for admission. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) \nA \u2013 AE Z) I admitted all of these exhibits into the record except AE O, which I excluded \nafter considering Department Counsel\u2019s objection. \n \nAt the hearing, I also incorporated Department Counsel\u2019s list of Government \nExhibits (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I), and a copy of Department Counsel\u2019s discovery letter \n(HE II). In addition, Department Counsel submitted a memo (HE III) requesting that I \ntake administrative notice of the facts set forth in four U.S. Department of State \ndocuments regarding the Philippines (HE IV \u2013 HE VIII). Applicant\u2019s counsel objected. I \nstayed my decision on the administrative notice request, leaving the record open \nthrough October 26, 2018 to allow Applicant\u2019s counsel to respond to Department \nCounsel\u2019s request, and to submit administrative notice documents, if desired. Within the \ntime allotted, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted a memo (HE IX) requesting that I take \nadministrative notice of the facts set forth in eight documents (HE X \u2013 XVIII). After \nconsidering all of the facts set forth in the exhibits provided by both parties, I have \ndecided to take administrative notice of all of them except HE XV, Human Rights Watch \n2016\u2014The United States, and HE XVI, Department of Justice Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation: 2016 Crime in the United States.  \n \nWhile my decision was pending, Security Executive Agent Directive 4 was issued \nestablishing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) applicable to all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information \nor eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The AG supersede the adjudicative guidelines \n                                            \n1 There are six allegations under Paragraph 1 and five allegations under Paragraph 2. The Paragraph 1 \nallegations are correctly annotated as subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f. The Paragraph 2 allegations are \nerroneously annotated as 2.g through 2.k rather than 2.a through 2.e. After Department Counsel identified \nthis error at the hearing and discussed it with Applicant\u2019s counsel, the parties suggested that, as a matter \nof judicial economy, I forego amending the SOR,and rule upon the allegations, as written. I concurred. \n(Tr. 7-8) \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nimplemented in September 2006 and are effective for any adjudication made on or after \nJune 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have adjudicated Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility \nunder the new AG. The transcript was received on October 16, 2018. \n \nPreliminary Rulings \n \n \n1. Section 19 of the security clearance application that Applicant completed in \n2012 contains the following question: \n \nDo you have, or have you had, close and/or continuing contact with a \nforeign national within the last seven (7) years with whom you, or your \nspouse, or cohabitant are bound by affection, influence, common \ninterests, and/or obligation? . . .\u201d \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno,\u201d elaborating as follows: \n \nI have several women that I have met in my foreign travels, but none that I \nwould consider to be seriously bound by affection or obligatien [sic] with. \n \nSOR subparagraph 2.h alleges Applicant\u2019s \u201cno\u201d answer constitutes a falsification. \nCounsel for Applicant filed a motion to dismiss this claim, arguing that the allegation, on \nits face, does not state a justiciable claim.  \n \n \nWhether the nature of Applicant\u2019s relationships with these foreign women is as \ncasual as he believes them to be is certainly an issue to be addressed under the \nGuideline B security concerns, as alleged in Paragraph 1. Similarly, the nature and \nappropriateness of these relationships raise a Guideline E issue, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 2.g. However, Applicant\u2019s negative response to Section 19, in conjunction \nwith his disclosure that he has met several women over the years during his foreign \ntravels whom he is not bound by affection or obligation is sufficiently candid and \nforthcoming, so as not to raise any issue of falsification, on its face. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel\u2019s motion to dismiss subparagraph 2.h is granted. (DoD Directive 5220.6, \nE3.1.10) \n \n \n2. Section 20B of the 2012 security clearance application required Applicant to \ndisclose if he had ever provided financial support for any foreign national. His negative \nanswer, together with his detailed elaboration,2 is candid and forthcoming. \nConsequently, subparagraph 2.i, on its face, raises no issue of falsification. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel\u2019s motion to dismiss subparagraph 2.i is granted. (DoD Directive 5220.6, \nE3.1.10) \n \n                                            \n2There have been several foreign women I have given money to via Western Union in the \nPhilippines as gifts to help them, but I would not consider the gifts as long-term financial support. I \ndo not know their addresses to be able to answer the questions properly if I answered \u2018yes.\u2019 \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n3. Section 20A of the 2012 security clearance application required Applicant to \ndisclose whether he had any additional foreign financial interests. Applicant\u2019s negative \nresponse was not followed by any additional explanation. The issue of whether his \nresponse constitutes a falsification, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 2.j, must be \nevaluated through the record evidence developed at the hearing. Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s \nmotion to dismiss subparagraph 2.j is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old single man who was married previously between 1987 \nand 1995. The marriage ended in divorce. He has a high school diploma and has \nearned some college credits. (Tr. 231) After graduating from high school, he enlisted in \nthe U.S. Air Force in 1982, serving through his retirement in 2003. (GE 2 at 13) Per a \nfellow Air Force veteran who served with him, he is an honest, trustworthy man who is \nhardworking and dependable. (AE W)  \n \nAfter retirement, Applicant worked stateside for a defense contractor for a year, \nthrough approximately May 2004. Since then, he has lived and worked for contractors \nalmost exclusively in combat zones. (Tr. 87; AE B) He is a radar technician who is \nresponsible for the installation, upgrade, maintenance, and repair of radars and radios. \n(Tr. 89; AE B) He has held a security clearance since 1982. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s work is extremely dangerous. He lives and works on base, embedded \nwith the soldiers, and he frequently comes under enemy fire. (Tr. 80, 86) He typically \nworks 12 hours per day for seven days a week. (Tr. 89) He shares his living space, a six \nfoot by eight foot converted cargo container, with three roommates. (Tr. 91-92) Per \nApplicant\u2019s employment contract, he is allowed to take vacation leave every six months. \nHe does not always use his leave \u201cbecause the needs of the military come first.\u201d (Tr. \n125) As of the hearing date, he had been working continuously without break for more \nthan 12 months. (Tr. 125)  \n \nPer a coworker, Applicant is \u201cthe go-to guy whenever systems [go] down, and is \none of the most talented technicians with whom he has ever worked.\u201d (AE X). According \nto another coworker, whom Applicant trained, he is a highly talented individual who \nprovided an unmatched level of support for the warfighters. (AE Y) Over the years, \nApplicant has won multiple awards for exceptional performance. (AE B, AE J, AE P; Tr. \n101-102) \n \nApplicant frequently vacations in the Philippines. During the course of his travels, \nhe has become acquainted with many people including women he dated and families he \nhelped financially. As a traveler who has visited and spent significant amounts of time in \ndeveloping countries, Applicant has witnessed abject poverty. Believing that much \nforeign aid, either from the U.S. government or from international charities, is \nsquandered by corrupt officials who govern many of these countries, Applicant finds it \nmore gratifying to assist needy people directly rather than through charitable donations. \n(Tr. 132) He is particularly interested in helping people be more self-sufficient. (Tr. 173) \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nOver the years, he has helped a family in the Philippines restore electric power \nthat had been lost after a typhoon. (Tr. 136) On another occasion, he helped repair a \nhome in the Philippines that had also been damaged in a typhoon. (AE Q at 3; AE T)   \n \nApplicant is equally committed to humanitarian assistance in the United States. \n(AE U, AE V) Several years ago, he gave $1,000 to a charity to help flood victims after a \nhurricane. In addition, on one occasion, he donated $1,000 to a U.S.-based disaster \nrelief charity. (AE U)  \n \n \nIn approximately 2008, during a visit to the Philippines, Applicant, while \nshopping, noticed a teenage girl (Acquaintance (A) 1) who appeared to be \u201cin a really \nbad way.\u201d (Tr. 208)) When he asked her what was wrong, she told him that she had not \neaten in three days. Applicant then took her to a fast-food restaurant. (GE 2 at 17)  After \nApplicant left the Philippines, he corresponded with her approximately two to three \ntimes a year via the internet.  \n \n \nApplicant returned to the Philippines in 2010. He had no contact with A1. In 2011, \nApplicant returned to the Philippines, staying approximately two to three weeks. He \nvisited A1, meeting with her for 20 to 30 minutes. In 2013, when Applicant visited the \nPhilippines, he met A1\u2019s family. Noticing that they had no electricity, and a makeshift \nroof composed of tin and bamboo leaves, Applicant helped them install electric service \nand repair the roof. (Tr. 135) During the trip, Applicant also provided financial assistance \nto A1. He helped send her to sewing school, and he paid her $2,500 in five increments \nto help her start a 7-11 style market. Since 2013, Applicant and A1 have communicated \nsporadically by phone. (GE 2 at 18) He neither had sexual intercourse with A1, nor \npropositioned her for sex. (Tr. 207) \n \n \nWhile on a vacation to the Philippines in early 2010, as referenced in the \nparagraph above, Applicant met A2. She worked at a moped rental shop and cleaned \nhomes for a living. Shortly after meeting, they began dating and became intimately \ninvolved. Applicant saw her three times over the two weeks that he was in the \nPhilippines. (Tr. 211) After leaving the Philippines, Applicant remained in touch with her \ndaily via Skype between 2010 and 2012. (GE 2 at 14)  When Applicant was dating A2, \nhe sent her approximately $300 to help pay for medical expenses. (Tr. 169)  By 2013, \nApplicant\u2019s contact with A2 had become less frequent. He has had no contact with her \nsince March 2016. (Tr. 212) \n \n \nIn either 2010 or 2011, Applicant met A3 while visiting the Philippines. She is a \nwaitress. He dated her for three to four weeks. While dating, he gave her $1,500, \nincluding gifts, money to buy a bicycle, and sewing school tuition. After returning from \nvacation, he stayed in touch with her sporadically, but stopped after realizing that she \nwas using him to get money for her family. (GE 2 at 4)  His last contact with her was in \n2011. (GE 2 at 18) \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nApplicant met A4, a prostitute, while on vacation in the Philippines in October \n2011. (Tr. 209) He paid her to have sex with him. (Tr. 209) Before leaving, he \npurchased her a refrigerator and helped her start a convenience store. (Tr. 168) After \nreturning to work, he stayed in touch with her via Skype once or twice per week. (GE 2 \nat 15; Tr. 207) Their last contact consisted of e-mail correspondence exchanged over \nthe holidays in 2013. (GE 2 at 14) \n \n \nApplicant met A5, a Filipino foreign national, on an airplane in 2011. She is the \nmother of four children and works as a house cleaner. Applicant gave her $1,700 to \nhelp her pay for a contracting agency that places clients, typically from developing \ncountries, in housecleaning jobs in wealthier countries. (Tr. 168) They never had sexual \nintercourse.  \n \n \nApplicant met A6 online. They have never subsequently met in person. (Tr. 216) \nShe has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business. (GE 2 at 17) With Applicant\u2019s help, she \nstarted a pig farming business. He invested $2,500 in the business. A6 paid him back in \nthe amount of $2,800. Three hundred dollars constituted return on investment. Applicant \nentered into this arrangement approximately six to eight months after he completed the \nsecurity clearance application. Their relationship was not intimate. \n \n \nApplicant met A7 while visiting the Philippines in February 2013. They were \nintimately involved. For seven to ten days, he enjoyed his vacation with her, shopping \nand sightseeing. (Tr. 215) He gave her $4,500 to help her start a fried chicken stand. He \ngave her this money incrementally over a period of several months. (Tr. 168) Although \nthey stay in touch periodically, they have not been romantically involved since Applicant \nfirst met her in 2013. His last contact with her was by phone in September 2018. (Tr. \n215) \n \n \nApplicant met A8 on the same trip that he met A7. He stayed in touch with her \ntwice per month electronically after returning from vacation. They have had no contact \nsince the fall of 2013. (GE 2 at 19) Their relationship was not intimate. \n \n \nApplicant met A9 while traveling to the Philippines in April 2013. She is a \nconstruction worker. Their relationship was not sexual. Applicant gave her between \n$800 and $1,600 to help pay for her diabetes treatment. (GE 2 at 17) After he returned \nfrom vacation, they initially stayed in touch several times per week via texting or Skype. \nTheir contact gradually decreased to electronic communication twice per month.  They \nare not currently in touch. \n \n \nApplicant met A10 on the same trip to the Philippines in 2013 that he met A9. \nShe is a restaurant hostess. Applicant had an intimate relationship with her. They spent \nthree days together dining out, shopping, and visiting her at her home. After Applicant \nreturned to base from vacation, they communicated electronically approximately twice a \nmonth through January 2014. (GE 2 at 17) In approximately April 2014, Applicant gave \nher $500 to help her pay her rent. (GE 2 at 17-18) \n \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nIn approximately 2014, Applicant purchased a condo in the Philippines for \n$34,000 USD. (Tr. 116) It is roughly the size of a hotel suite. (AE R) Applicant \npurchased it because, given the frequency that he visits the Philippines, it is cheaper to \nown a condo rather than to pay hotel costs for each trip. (Tr. 123) Also, the Philippines \nis \u201ca great jumping off spot to travel to other locations\u201d around the world. (Tr. 124) The \ncondo\u2019s current value is approximately $8,000 USD. (Tr. 123) Applicant does not rent it \nto anyone when he is not occupying it. (Tr. 125) \n \n \nApplicant has money deposited in seven bank accounts. Five bank accounts are \nin the United States and two of the bank accounts are in the Philippines. (Tr. 107) \nCollectively, he has approximately $8,000 USD deposited in the Philippines accounts. \nHe opened the first account to facilitate the purchase of his condo in 2014. (Tr. 111; AE \nD at 3) He uses it to pay condo fees, utilities, and property taxes. Now, he uses it for his \nvacation expenses. He opened the account, in part, to avoid exorbitant ATM conversion \nfees that his U.S. bank charges for foreign transactions. Applicant opened the second \nbank account in the Philippines to take advantage of a perk in which the bank waives \nthe $100 USD fee that the country charges foreign visitors seeking to apply for visa \nextensions. (Tr. 112) \n \n \nApplicant purchased his primary property in the United States in 2007. Because \nhe is home only once every 18 to 24 months, he generally keeps it boarded. Applicant \nrents his other two U.S. properties.  (Tr. 118) Applicant\u2019s combined annual salary and \nretirement income totals approximately $322,000.  (Tr. 103; AE D at 3) His net worth is \n1.7 million dollars. \n \n \nFor approximately four months in 2012, before taking his current job, and after \nfinishing his previous job in a combat zone, Applicant performed contract work in \nFinland. (Tr. 87) While there, he became romantically involved with a waitress who was \na citizen of Thailand. He had sex with her twice. Their relationship never became close \nbecause of their language barrier. \n \n \nIn the past, Applicant considered settling down, moving to the Philippines and \npursuing a serious relationship with a Filipino woman. Now, he is no longer interested in \nmarrying anyone from the Philippines because of the communication gap that he has \nfound which often exists between him and the women he has dated over the years. He \nno longer visits his ex-girlfriends when he travels to the Philippines. He now \nunderstands that the only reason many of them want to \u201chang out\u201d with him is because \nof the possibility that he may buy them good food and great gifts. (Tr. 140)  As for \nrelocating to the Philippines, Applicant ruled this out because his condo is too small. \nAfter living for years in a cramped, Spartan space while working on base, he prefers to \npurchase a home where he can \u201cspread his legs out.\u201d (Tr. 231) Applicant occasionally \n\u201cget[s] random contacts out of the clear blue, but there\u2019s nothing close to close and \ncontinuing happening\u201d with any of the women he has met while traveling to the \nPhilippines. (Tr. 213) \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nWhile Applicant was working in Finland, he took a ferry boat ride to Estonia and \nstayed there for two to three days. He spent the time in Estonia sightseeing. (Tr. 86, \n177)  \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in September 2012. He \nanswered \u201cno\u201d in response to Section 20B, which required him to disclose foreign \ninterests. (See Preliminary Ruling Section, supra) The SOR alleges that he failed to \ndisclose business consulting and financial support he provided to several women who \nwere citizens and residents of the Philippines. Applicant contends that whatever advice \nhe gave to Filipino women that he helped start businesses was limited to basic \ncommon-sense suggestions such as reminding them not to forget to subtract inventory \ncosts from sales revenue when calculating profit. (Tr. 173) Applicant also testified that \nany profit from their businesses was so small by U.S. standards that if he were to have \nrequested a share, it \u201cwould [have] defeat[ed] the purpose . . . of trying to help them.\u201d \n(Tr. 167)  \n \nApplicant did receive a return on his investment in the pig farming business. \nApplicant helped the Filipino woman with the pig farming venture after he completed the \nsecurity clearance application. He earned $300 from the investment. \n \nIn response to Section 20C of Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, \nregarding whether he had travelled outside of the United States in the past seven years, \nhe answered, \u201cyes.\u201d In the second question under Section 20C, asking whether the \nforeign travel was solely for Government business, Applicant also answered \u201cyes.\u201d (GE \n1 at 28) The Government alleges in SOR subparagraph 2.k that Applicant\u2019s failure to \ndisclose trips to the Philippines in 2010 and 2011, a trip to Estonia in 2012, and a trip to \nFinland in July 2012 constitutes a falsification. Applicant testified that he always \nreported his foreign travel to his supervisor per company policy, and that his facility \nsecurity officer (FSO) told him that he was only required to list travel to adversarial \ncountries. (AE M; AE Q at 2; Tr. 174-175)  \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nThe Philippine government is a multi-party, constitutional republic with a \nbicameral legislature. (HE IV at 1) The relationship between the United States and the \nPhilippines is based on a strong historical and cultural link. (HE XII) The United States \nand the Philippines maintain a robust relationship through several person-to-person \ncultural exchanges sponsored by both governments, as well as non-governmental \norganizations. (Id.) Approximately 220,000 U.S. citizens live in the Philippines. (Id.) \nManila, the capital of the Philippines, is home to the only U.S. Bureau of Veterans \nAffairs office and health care clinic outside of the United States. (HE XI at 1-2) The \nlargest U.S. cemetery outside of the United States is in the Philippines. \n \n \nManila is a high-threat location for crime directed at, or affecting U.S. government \ninterests. (HE VII at 1) The U.S. Department of State advises all U.S. citizens \ncontemplating travel to the Philippines to exercise increased caution due to crime, \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                              \nterrorism, and civil unrest. (HE VIII) Certain regions of the Philippines have been acutely \naffected by Islamic State-sponsored terrorism.  (HE V) The Philippines government has \nconsistently acknowledged the danger from such groups and has welcomed assistance \nfrom the United States. (HE V)  \n \n \nAlthough the Philippines is a democratic republic, its human rights record is poor. \nOver an 18-month period between July 2016 and October 2017, government agents \nand their informal allies arbitrarily and unlawfully killed thousands of people allegedly \nconnected to the distribution of illegal drugs. (HE IV at 2) Other problems include torture \nof prisoners, life-threatening prison conditions, arbitrary jailing of political prisoners, and \nwarrantless arrests by security forces. (HE IV at 1) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 7: \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest.  \n \n  \nThe Philippines is an ally of the United States and is a partner in fighting \nterrorism. However, terrorism and civil unrest is pervasive in parts of the country, crime \nis rampant, and the government has a history of brutally disregarding the human rights \nof its citizens in enforcing the rule of law. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with girlfriends over the years and various other people whom he has \nhelped financially, raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 7(a) applies, and Applicant\u2019s \nproperty interest in the Philippines raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 7(f) applies. \n \n  \nNone of Applicant\u2019s romantic relationships were long-term or serious. Although \nApplicant spent thousands of dollars over the years helping Filipino citizens and \nresidents, buying gifts for his then-girlfriends and helping them financially, this money \nwas minimal in relation to his total net worth. The most recent evidence of a romantic \nrelationship with a citizen and resident of the Philippines occurred approximately five \nyears ago. Any residual contact with ex-girlfriends is casual and infrequent. \nConsequently, the casual, infrequent nature of Applicant\u2019s relationship with his friends \nand acquaintances who are citizens and residents of the Philippines renders the \npossibility of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion \nminimal. AG \u00b6 7(a) does not apply. Assuming for the sake of argument that the \nconcerns about crime, terrorism, and human rights abuses in the Philippines were \nsufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 7(a), it is mitigated by AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d I resolve \nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n  \nThe value of Applicant\u2019s condo and his bank accounts in the Philippines are \nminimal in relation to the value of his properties in the United States and to his total net \nworth. Consequently, the possibility that it could create the potential for coercion, \ninfluence, or exploitation is minimal. AG \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign \nbusiness, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a \nconflict and could not be used to effectively influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual,\u201d applies. I resolve SOR subparagraph 1.d and 1.e in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n  \nA clear and accurate assessment of a country\u2019s geo-political position vis a vis the \nUnited States is crucial in a heightened risk analysis. (ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4, \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                              \nn.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007) The Government presented no such evidence about either \nThailand or Finland. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s past relationship with a \nThai citizen residing in Finland does not generate a security concern. I resolve SOR \nsubparagraph 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n  \nApplicant disclosed that he has met several women during his foreign travels on \nhis 2012 security clearance application. He identified and discussed his relationships \nwith them comprehensively during the investigative process. Consequently, I resolve \nSOR subparagraph 1.f, alleging that he failed to report association with foreign \nnationals, in his favor. In sum, Applicant has mitigated the Guideline B security concern. \n  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes.\u201d (Id.) \n \n  \nThe personal conduct security concern is not applicable to Applicant\u2019s purchase \nof property in the Philippines to use during his occasional visits because it is not \nreflective of dishonesty, untrustworthiness, or bad judgment. Any security concerns \nregarding the property were addressed under the Guideline B section above. \n \n  \nApplicant is a single man who has lived nearly continuously in combat zones for \nthe past 15 years, working seven days per week for his employer under extraordinarily \nstressful and austere conditions. These facts, together with his testimony, lead me to \nconclude that emotional fulfillment was not what Applicant was primarily seeking when \nhe entered into romantic relationships with his various paramours in the Philippines \nduring his brief vacation time over the years. Conversely, he was not intimately involved \nwith every woman he met while vacationing in the Philippines, and he assisted them \nfinancially regardless of whether he was having sexual intercourse with them. Moreover, \nhe has not had an intimate relationship with any citizens and residents of the Philippines \nin approximately five years. Applicant has a history of helping people in need, giving \n$2,000 over the years to U.S. charities to help flood victims. Under these \ncircumstances, the altruism Applicant demonstrated by helping women when visiting the \nPhilippines was not diminished by whether or not he was romantically involved with \nthem. I conclude that SOR subparagraph 2.g generates no security concern. \n \n  \nAs for Applicant\u2019s response to Section 20B of his security clearance application \nregarding foreign interests in the Philippines, Applicant\u2019s help to Philippine foreign \nnationals consisted of financial support to help them start businesses or attend trade \nschool. The advice that he has occasionally provided to them over the years was limited \nto innocuous, common-sense suggestions. Under these circumstances, I conclude that \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant did not falsify Section 20B of his security clearance application, as alleged in \nSOR subparagraph 2.j.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s FSO told him that he was only required to report foreign trips to \nadversarial countries. He always reported his foreign travel to his supervisor in advance \nof his trips. Under these circumstances, I conclude that his failure to disclose two trips to \nthe Philippines, a trip to Finland, and a trip to Estonia,  when he answered \u201cno\u201d to \nQuestion 20C regarding foreign, non-work related travel over the past seven years, did \nnot constitute a falsification, and at worst, constituted a careless, but honest mistake. In \nreaching this conclusion, I considered his explanation, together with his forthcoming \nresponses to the other security clearance application questions, and his good character. \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance for more than 35 years, and he has spent \nnearly his entire adult life serving the country, first as an enlisted Airman, and after \nretirement, as a contractor, working nearly year round in combat zones for the past 15 \nyears. While working abroad, Applicant has largely sacrificed a conventional, \ncomfortable life stateside for an ascetic life with the near-constant threat of physical \nharm. I considered these facts in assessing his credibility, and in my disposition of the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions of the alleged guidelines.  \n \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                              \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 2.g \u2013 2.k:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nMarc Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 59 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He is married, with no children. Applicant was honorably retired from the Air Force as a technical sergeant (E-6) in 2001, and has an Associate of Arts degree. He is seeking to retain national security eligibility for a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13C, 15, 17.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he suffers from an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR with explanations. He also submitted additional documentation to support a finding of national security eligibility. Applicant\u2019s mental health issues were first identified when he attempted to commit suicide on November 14, 2009. He changed his mind, called the police, and was committed to a hospital for observation and mental health treatment. (Government Exhibits 6, 7; Tr. 31.) Applicant was discharged from the hospital on November 25, 2009, with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe, With Psychotic Features.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On December 28, 2017, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline I \n(Psychological Conditions). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudication Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of \nDefense after June 8, 2017. \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on January 22, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on March 1, 2018. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on March \n15, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 25, 2018. The Government \noffered Government Exhibits 1 through 10, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant offered Applicant Exhibits A through C, which were admitted without objection, \nand testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on May 3, \n2018.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He is married, \nwith no children. Applicant was honorably retired from the Air Force as a technical \nsergeant (E-6) in 2001, and has an Associate of Arts degree. He is seeking to retain \nnational security eligibility for a security clearance in connection with his employment. \n(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13C, 15, 17.)  \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he suffers from an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair his \njudgment, reliability or trustworthiness. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR \nwith explanations. He also submitted additional documentation to support a finding of \nnational security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mental health issues were first identified when he attempted to commit \nsuicide on November 14, 2009. He changed his mind, called the police, and was \ncommitted to a hospital for observation and mental health treatment. (Government \nExhibits 6, 7; Tr. 31.) \n \n \nApplicant was discharged from the hospital on November 25, 2009, with a \ndiagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe, With Psychotic Features. \nProgress notes from his hospitalization are found in Government Exhibit 8. The notes are \nreplete with statements by Applicant that he felt he was being covertly observed, even \nwhile he was in the hospital. (See Tr. 33.) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nPertinent excerpts from his Discharge Summary (Government Exhibit 9) are as \nfollows: \n \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50-year-old Caucasian male \nwith no past psychiatric diagnosis. He was brought in by police on a 5150 \nfor danger to self after patient [Applicant] cut both of his wrists superficially \nand was observed to be sitting in warm water in a bathtub. The patient \nstated, \u201cI cut a little more initially, but it didn\u2019t work. I got scared and called \nthe police.\u201d The patient stated that he had been feeling that people were \nfollowing him for the last year and a half. The patient believed they were \nmilitary personnel. The patient was unsure why they were following him, but \nthey were looking at him in the home as well as following him around \nwherever he went. The patient stated he believed he was being monitored, \n\u201cBecause I stare at children too long.\u201d . . . The patient denied auditory or \nvisual hallucinations. The patient however was preoccupied with his \ndelusions to the point of feeling that people were following him even in the \nhospital. The patient reported history of recurrent episodes of depression, \nbut no psychosis in the past. . . The patient stated that he felt that he needed \nto kill himself to save his wife.  \n \n \nThe hospital records further state, under \u201cCOURSE OF HOSPITALIZATION\u201d: \n \nThe patient demonstrated gradual improvement to his symptoms with \ntreatment. . . The patient reported significant decrease in the intensity and \nfrequency of his paranoid delusions. The patient states that he was no \nlonger bothered by them. The patient initially had thoughts of ending his life \nto save his wife. The patient, however, reported resolution of any suicidal or \nhomicidal ideations.  \n \n \nApplicant was prescribed drugs, and also advised to obtain counseling. He \ncontinues on a drug regimen, as well as counseling, as further described below. \n(Applicant Exhibits A and B.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on September 11, 2014. The investigator prepared a Report of \nInvestigation \n(ROI), \nwhich \nstated \nas \nfollows \nconcerning \nApplicant\u2019s \n\u201cPSYCHOLOGICAL/EMOTIONAL HEALTH\u201d: \n \nThe subject\u2019s anxiety stems from the constant feeling that people are \nwatching him, at work, going to the bathroom, at home, when he is driving, \nto \u201csuggest he is doing things he isn\u2019t supposed to do\u201d in order to get rid of \nhim. The subject could not elaborate on what he meant by \u201cthings he isn\u2019t \nsupposed to do.\u201d These feelings first started in about 2003 date not recalled, \nat home, then in about 2005, date not recalled, at work. The subject has \nspoken with his supervisor about his belief that people are watching him to \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nget him on something. The subject\u2019s supervisor has told the subject that no \none is trying to watch him or get things on him. The subject thinks that his \nsupervisor thinks he is \u201ca bit off.\u201d The subject has not had any disciplinary \nactions or confrontations. (See Tr. 26-27.) \n \nThe subject\u2019s counseling and medication have helped him to understand \nthat people are not out to get him, but he still can\u2019t help getting the feeling \nthat people are watching him. (Government Exhibit 2 at 2.)  \n \n \nBased in part on this interview a staff psychologist at the DoD CAF recommended \nthat Applicant receive a medical evaluation. The psychologist stated, \u201cEven in the face of \nthe very limited favorable medical testimony, a concern exists about the subject\u2019s \njudgment and reliability based upon his intrusive thoughts/anxieties he expressed to the \nOPM investigator during his 11 SEP 14 PSI [Personal Subject Interview].\u201d (Government \nExhibit 4.) \n \n \nApplicant received a psychological evaluation from a licensed psychologist/clinical \nneuropsychologist (Evaluator) on November 3 and 10, 2017. (See Tr. 36.) The \nEvaluator\u2019s report is Government Exhibit 3. Pertinent excerpts from this document are as \nfollows: \n \nCOLLATERAL INTERVIEWS (CONDUCTED BY PHONE): \n \n[Applicant] provided a signed authorization for this evaluator to speak with \nhis treating psychiatrist Dr. [A]. On November 8, 2017, Dr. [A] reported that \n[Applicant] is being treated for Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, \nsevere, with psychotic features and Delusional Disorder. He has been \ntreating [Applicant] since December 2009. Dr. [A] first began providing \ntreatment on a monthly basis and reduced it to one time every two months. \n[Applicant] is reported to be consistent with is appointments. The current \nprescribed psychotropic medications are as follows: Risperdal .5 mg, \nWellbutrin 150 mg, Lexapro 20 mg, and Klonopin .5 mg. Dr. [A] is aware of \n[Applicant\u2019s] persecutory/paranoid delusions, and reports Risperdal .5 mg \nis a low dose, but he has been unable to increase the dose due to reported \nside-effects. Dr. [A], reports Risperdal is about the only antipsychotic \nmedication that [Applicant] will tolerate. Some of the paranoid delusions that \nDr. [A] is aware of are as follows: Co-workers are talking about him, playing \ngames with him, his work is trying to fire him, he is being monitored by his \ncomputer and his telephone. Dr. [A] reports that [Applicant] is guarded and \ndoes not go into detail about the paranoid delusions. Dr. [A] reports that he \ndoes not believe that there would be a problem in [Applicant\u2019s] judgment or \nreliability in safeguarding secret/confidential information because of the \nfollowing: He has known [Applicant] for so long, he is able to perform his \njob, has been relatively free of disciplinary actions, has not been fired from \nhis job, and [Applicant] is at baseline/not deteriorating. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nBRIEF HISTORY OF RELEVENT ISSUES:   \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n. \n. \n. \n \n \nAlthough he continues to work as a . . . Assistant Site Manager, and \nhas been with the same company for many years, [Applicant] reports having \nthe following complaints (persecutory/paranoid delusions): His work is \ntrying to fire him because he stares at women too long; co-workers are \ntalking about him, playing games with him; he is being monitored by his \ncomputer and his telephone, \u201cPeople are working on getting me fired; they \ntrack how many times I look at women; security guards on the base can \nread my mind or put things in my mind.\u201d [Applicant] reports ongoing \ntreatment with Dr. [A], psychiatrist, for medication management, and [Dr. B], \nPhD, MFCC, for individual therapy. [Applicant] reports ongoing discussions, \non the above ideations, with both treatment providers. Dr. [A] reports he is \naware of the above delusions.  \n \n \nPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION/TESTING RESULTS:  \n \nMental Status Exam: . . . [Applicant] reported suffering stress due to people \nat his work trying to get him fired . . . No obvious or unusual anxiety \nsymptoms were noticed, beyond closing his eyes when reporting paranoid \nideations. [Applicant\u2019s] thought process was linear; his thought content was \nirrational when discussing paranoid delusions; thought content was relevant \nto the topic being discussed. . . . \n \nPersonality Assessment Inventory (PAI): This evaluator administered the \nPAI to [Applicant], which resulted in a valid profile, validity indices were well \nwithin the normal range, suggesting that he answered in a consistent \nmanner, attended appropriately to the item content, and had an ability to \nidentify positive and negative qualities/attributes about himself. \n \n[Applicant] elevated several of the clinical scales, indicating that he suffers \nfrom significant anxiety, depression, and psychotic symptoms. The most \nsignificantly elevated clinical scales suggest that [Applicant] is hypervigilant \nand overly suspicious; he spends much time monitoring his environment for \nevidence that others are trying to harm or discredit him. He also has \npersecutory beliefs that people are plotting against him in some sort of \nconspiracy (e.g., \u201cPeople want to fire me\u201d). People may view him as odd \nand eccentric, due to his hypervigilance and unconventional ideas. As a \nresult of his paranoid ideations (e.g., \u201cSecurity guards on base can read my \nmind and put things in my mind\u201d) and related anxiety, he socially isolates \nand detaches, which may serve to decrease his social discomfort. \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n. \n. \n. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nAlthough he is not aware that many of his thoughts are delusional in nature, \nhe acknowledges that he has major emotional difficulties and believes he \nneeds help.  \n \n \nBased on the foregoing, under the section \u201cDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS,\u201d the \nEvaluator found the following diagnoses, which are consistent with those of Dr. A, set \nforth above: Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with psychotic features; and, \nDelusional Disorder, Persecutory Type.  \n \n \nThe report concludes: \n \nIMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS \n \nLong-term prognosis is fair if [Applicant] is willing/able to tolerate an \nincrease \nin \nRisperdal \n(or \nanother \nantipsychotic \nmedication \nas \nrecommended by Dr. [A]). In the past, [Applicant] adhered to a higher dose \nof Risperdal, resulting in an improved mental state and stability. However, \nat this time, [Applicant\u2019s] immediate prognosis is poor. He continues to have \nsignificant paranoid delusions, depressed mood, anxiety, and periodic \nsuicide ideation. Insight into his delusions is currently poor. There is \ncurrently significant interpersonal functional impairment in [Applicant\u2019s] life. \nHe also has a history of occupational difficulties (e.g., Unable to work as a \nresult of psychiatric hospitalization in 2009, security clearance was revoked \nin 2009) without mental health treatment. Without an increase in Risperdal \n(or another antipsychotic), his prognosis is likely to remain poor. \n \nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS \n \nAt this time, [Applicant\u2019s] current mental state and functioning impacts his \nability, reliability, judgment, stability and trustworthiness in handling or \nsafeguarding classified information. I agree with Dr. [A] that [Applicant] is \nable to perform his job, and does not have a history of aggression or being \nfired from his place of employment. However, [Applicant] is not in touch with \nreality, at this time, due to his continued paranoid delusions; furthermore, \nhe continues to experience depression and anxiety, and periodic suicide \nideation; this dysregulation of neurotransmitters could affect the frontal \nlobes, and areas involved in decision making and metacognition. As a result \nof his current mental state, and poor insight, there is significant concern that \n[Applicant] could pose a risk of unauthorized disclosure or mishandling of \nclassified information.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. A, provided a written statement dated April 23, \n2018. It is Applicant Exhibit A and reads as follows: \n \nPlease be advised that [Applicant] has been under my psychiatric care since \n12/15/2009 for the medication management of major depression with \npsychotic features and the delusional disorder, persecutory type. He is seen \nevery one to two months for medication management and his current \nmedications are Lexapro 20 mg at bedtime, Zyprexa 2.5 mg at bedtime and \nKlonopin 0.5 mg as needed.2 [Applicant] attends his sessions regularly and \nhas \nbeen \ncompliant \nwith \nthe \nrecommendations \nfor \nmedication \nmanagement.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that his psychiatrist had changed his prescription from Risperdal \nto Zyprexa because of some suicidal thoughts he was having. He also thought that Dr. A \nput him on Zyprexa because of the recommendation from the Evaluator that Applicant\u2019s \nmedication either be changed or increased. (Tr. 37-38.) \n \n \nApplicant also has a treating psychologist, Dr. B, who also submitted a written \nstatement, dated March 22, 2018. He has been seeing Applicant since approximately \n2005. (Tr. 25, 38-39.) The statement is Applicant Exhibit B and reads as follows: \n \nI am writing this letter to confirm that [Applicant] has been in individual \ncounseling with me. [Applicant] has been showing good progress in dealing \nwith his anxiety issues. We have been utilizing Cognitive Behavioral \nTherapy and Solution Focused Therapy as the basis for affecting change in \nhis life. [Applicant] reports improvement in dealing with the stressors of his \nlife. He is a very willing and cooperative client who has an excellent \nprognosis. \n \n \nApplicant testified concerning his issues at some length. He confirmed that his \nissues began in 2004 or 2005 with a constant feeling that people were watching him at \nwork, while going to the bathroom, at home, while he was driving, and suggesting that he \nwas doing things he wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing. Applicant testified that he continued to \nhave these feelings today about his fellow workers. He also believed at the time of the \nhearing that such observation was being done covertly by his management and \ninvestigators, though not as much as during earlier days. (Tr. 24-32.)  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 I take administrative notice of the following facts concerning the drugs that are currently prescribed for \nApplicant. Lexapro is an anti-depressant. (WebMD, Lexapro, https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-\n63990/lexapro-oral/details (accessed December 28, 2018).) Zyprexa is an anti-psychotic. (WebMD, \nZyprexa, https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1699/zyprexa-oral/details (accessed December 28, \n2018).)  Klonopin is used to treat panic disorder and anxiety. (WebMD, Klonopin, https://www.webmd.com/ \ndrugs/2/drug-920-6006/klonopin-oral/clonazepam-oral/details (accessed December 28, 2018).) \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not believe the security guards at work were reading \nhis mind and putting thoughts in his head. He further testified: \n \nThere\u2019s this one Security outfit that has some kind of device or something, \nif you\u2019ve seen on the news and whatnot. They\u2019ve had ways where they can \ngo, where people can go and use hearing \u2013 brain-connecting hearing aids \n\u2013 to brain waves so deaf people can hear and whatnot. So, it\u2019s not really a \nstretch for those same waves to be \u2013 if they have the right frequency \u2013 could \ngo and listen and understand them. (Tr. 46.) \n \n \nHe was asked by me, \u201cAnd you believe this is happening with you?\u201d Applicant \nresponded, \u201cIt happened yes.\u201d I also asked him, \u201cIs it currently happening, or in the past?\u201d \nApplicant stated, \u201cIn the past, yes, Your Honor.\u201d (Ibid.) \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a letter of recommendation from a retired member of the Air \nForce who knows Applicant well. The writer met Applicant at church, believes Applicant \nto be a trustworthy person, and recommends him to receive national security eligibility. \n(Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 39-40.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in \u00a7 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, \u00a7 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions) \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \n \n \nApplicant has been suffering from several diagnosed, severe, mental health \nconditions since at least 2009. He was psychiatrically hospitalized at that time because \nof a suicide attempt. His diagnosed conditions include major depression with psychotic \nfeatures, and a delusional disorder, persecutory type. These delusions are specifically \nrelated to his work, where he believes he is being covertly watched, that his management \nis conspiring against him, and that a security outfit has been able to use a device to read \nhis mind and put ideas into his head. Applicant testified about his delusions, which he \ncontinues to believe. In addition, Government Exhibit 3 is an extensive report from a DoD-\napproved mental health consultant who opined that Applicant\u2019s conditions are not under \ncontrol and may impair his judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nAfter evaluating all the available evidence, I find that none of these mitigating \nconditions apply with force enough to overcome the weight of evidence. First, it must be \nunderstood that there is no allegation that Applicant has ever mishandled classified \ninformation. However, that is not the determining factor in this case. \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \n \nMitigating condition \u00b6 29(a) does not apply because there is little to no evidence \nthat Applicant\u2019s condition is controllable with treatment. He is compliant with the treatment \nplan, but the evidence shows that he is still subject to delusions. \n \n \nMitigating condition \u00b6 29(b) does not supply sufficient mitigation because there is \nlittle evidence that the counseling Applicant is receiving has resulted in a relevant \nfavorable prognosis by either of his mental health professionals. The Government is \nconcerned with Applicant\u2019s diagnosed delusions and depressive psychosis. The letter \nfrom Dr. A merely stated that Applicant is medication compliant. Dr. B\u2019s letter stated that \nApplicant has an \u201cexcellent prognosis.\u201d However, it is noted that the letter also stated that \nApplicant is being treated by Dr. B for \u201canxiety issues,\u201d which are distinct from the \ndepressive, psychotic, and delusional mental health concerns diagnosed by the \npsychiatrist.  \n \n \nMitigating conditions \u00b6 29(c) does not apply because the Evaluator had specific \nconcerns about Applicant, set forth in Government Exhibit 3, which have not been \nanswered. He found that Applicant\u2019s condition is not under control or remission, and that \nthere was a high probability of exacerbation. \n \n \nFinally, mitigating condition \u00b6 29(e) does not apply. Based on the report of the \nEvaluator, and Applicant\u2019s testimony, there is more than sufficient evidence of a current \nproblem. \n \n \nThe simple fact is that Applicant does not currently meet the conditions for a \ngranting of national security eligibility. There is always the possibility that his condition will \nstabilize, and that he will receive a favorable prognosis specifically concerning his \ndiagnoses of major depression with psychotic features, and delusional disorder, \npersecutory type. Until that happens, he is not eligible. Paragraph 1 is found against \nApplicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n \n12 \n \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an application for a public trust position on September 29, \n2014. On September 17, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR), citing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under \nDOD acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 17, 2017, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Applicant was separated from employment on April 19, 2018, \nand processing of the case was terminated for lack of jurisdiction.  \n1 Applicant married after the Statement of Reasons (SOR) was issued. This decision is captioned with her \nmarried name instead of the name reflected in the SOR. \n01/30/2019\n\n2 \n \nApplicant was employed by another defense contractor on November 7, 2018, and \nthe case was reopened and assigned to me on November 15, 2018. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a notice of hearing on November 26, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for December 19, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without \nobjection. I kept the record open until January 11, 2019, to enable her to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. She timely submitted AX B through I, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 4, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f. \nShe did not admit or deny the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Her admissions have \nbeen incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since November 2018. She has never held a security clearance or \neligibility for a public trust position. \n \n \nApplicant attended college from October 2000 to September 2001 and received a \ncertificate of completion for training as a legal office assistant. She attended college from \nJanuary 2006 to August 2007 and October 2009 to September 2011 but did not receive \na degree. She has student loans totaling about $74,000, on which deferment ended in \nDecember 2018. (Tr. 69.) The student loans are not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant married in July 2011. (GX 1 at 6.) Around December 2011, her husband \nleft her. She filed for divorce in 2012, and the divorce was final in May 2014. She has an \n11-year-old daughter from her previous marriage, for whom she receives child-support \npayments of $800 per month. She also has a 15-year-old son from a previous relationship, \nfor whom she receives child support of $147 per month. She remarried in 2017 and has \na 19-month-old daughter from this marriage. (GX 2 at 2-3; Tr. 30-31.) \n \n \nApplicant has worked for federal contractors since at least February 2002 as a \nreceptionist, technical assistant, executive assistant, administrative specialist, human-\nresources specialist, performance-management analyst, and payroll time-and- \nattendance specialist. She was unemployed from June to November 2011, when her \nemployer\u2019s contract ended. Her previous jobs did not offer medical insurance, and she \nincurred debts for medical care. She had a full-time day job and worked at full-time night \njobs at fast-food restaurants during the summer of 2012. She worked part time at a fast-\nfood restaurant for three months in 2012 or 2013. (GX 2 at 2.) In each case, she quit her \nnight job because she was physically unable to work two jobs. \n \n \nApplicant purchased a home in 2005 with an adjustable-rate mortgage. Her \nhusband\u2019s pay was reduced when he was moved from a supervisory position to a lower-\n                                                          \n2 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her application for a public trust position (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n3 \n \npaying non-supervisory position. (Tr. 46.) They filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nSeptember 2007 because they could not afford to pay the mortgage loan and could not \nobtain a loan modification. The bankruptcy also included her then husband\u2019s car loan, \nmedical bills, and her then husband\u2019s credit-card debt. They received a discharge in June \n2009. About $259,000-$280,000 was discharged. (GX 2 at 5; Tr. 32.) \n \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s first husband left her, she remained in the marital home, which \nshe had purchased in July 2010. Her mother, who has since passed away, also was living \nwith and supported by her. Applicant stayed in the marital home for about two months, \nmoved in with a friend, and then sold the marital home in a short sale. The credit report \nfrom April 2017 reflects that the mortgage loan was paid. (GX 4 at 1.) Her friend was \nretired military and employed full time. They agreed to split their living expenses, but \nApplicant found herself paying most of the expenses. She could not afford to move out, \nand so she continued to live with her friend for about two years. (Tr. 37-39.)  \n \nAround 2015, Applicant began living with a co-worker, and they married in 2017. \n(Tr. 30.) Her current husband is retired military and she is entitled to military medical \nbenefits as a military family member. Her current husband has given her financial \nguidance and has joined her in managing the family finances. (Tr. 40-41.) She testified \nthat her husband has prepared a spreadsheet for her, setting out a plan to resolve her \ndelinquent debts. It lists specific creditors and specific payment amounts to each creditor. \nShe did not submit the spreadsheet at the hearing. She promised to submit a copy of it, \nbut it was not included in her post-hearing submission. (Tr. 75-76.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a delinquent car loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b), and five medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g). The bankruptcy and delinquent \ndebts are reflected in credit reports from November 2018 (GX 3), April 2017 (GX 4), and \nOctober 2014 (GX 5.)  \n \nThe allegations of delinquent medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g do not comply with \nthe requirement for specificity in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.3, which requires that the SOR \u201cshall be \nas detailed and comprehensive as the national security permits.\u201d The SOR does not \nidentify the creditors or collection agents and provides no account numbers. The April \n2017 credit report on which they are based lists only the date each account was opened. \nHowever, Applicant was able to track down each of these medical debts. The evidence \nconcerning the delinquent debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: delinquent car loan charged off for $10,375. Applicant testified that \nthis debt was jointly incurred during her previous marriage. (Tr. 47.) The account was \nopened in December 2011, and the debt was charged off in June 2014. (GX 3 at 5; GX 5 \nat 3.) In a personal subject interview (PSI) in November 2014, Applicant told an \ninvestigator that she was negotiating with this creditor. She admitted this debt in her \nanswer to the SOR and stated that she would resolve it after she resolved other smaller \ndebts. At the hearing, she testified that she contacted the creditor and was offered a \nsettlement for $8,000, but she could not afford to accept it. (Tr. 47-48.) She did not provide \nany documentary evidence of the settlement offer. In her post-hearing submission, she \nasserted that this creditor informed her that it would not attempt to collect this debt \n\n4 \n \nbecause it is barred by the statute of limitations. (AX D.) She provided no documentary \nevidence to support her assertion regarding the statute of limitations.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: medical debt for eye surgery, past due for $172. This debt was \nincurred in December 2014, and the last payment was in March 2015. (GX 3 at 6; GX 4 \nat 2.) The total amount due on this debt is $2,826. (GX 4 at 2.) Applicant underwent laser \nsurgery after her vision declined and she began wearing glasses. She decided that the \nsurgery made more financial sense than paying for new glasses whenever her vision \nchanged. (Tr. 51.) Applicant has promised to make biweekly $75 payments beginning on \nJanuary 19, 2019. (AX I.) As of the date the record closed, she had not made any \npayments.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d: medical debt for $651. This debt was incurred when Applicant went \nto an emergency room after an automobile accident in 2013. She testified that she \ndisputed the amount of the debt because she left the emergency room for an unspecified \npersonal emergency before being treated. She settled the debt for a lesser amount on \nNovember 30, 2018, after she received the SOR. (AX A; Tr. 53-54.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: medical debt for $331. This debt was paid in full on September 28, \n2017, after Applicant received the SOR. (AX H.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: medical debt for $156. This debt was paid in full in March 2016. (AX \nG.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: medical debt for $47. This debt was paid in full on January 9, 2017. \n(AX F.) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual pay is about $96,000, which is a substantial increase from her \nprevious job, which paid $65,000 per year. Her take-home pay ranges from about $2,000 \nto $2,300. She has no savings. (Tr. 80.) Her husband is retired military, and his annual \npay is about $104,000. (Tr. 80.) Applicant does not know how much he receives in military \nretired pay. Her husband has four children from his previous marriage and pays child \nsupport for two of them. He also is still jointly liable for the mortgage payments on his \nprevious marital home. (Tr. 88.) Applicant\u2019s rent is $2,700. She pays $1,700, and her \nhusband pays $1,000, plus the utilities. They have a monthly car payment of $554. (Tr. \n67.) She did not provide any other information about her monthly living expenses. \n \n \nApplicant testified that she did not contact the various creditors alleged in the SOR \nuntil recently, because she did not have sufficient income to make payments, and she did \nnot want to make a payment agreement that she would be unable to afford. (Tr. 86.) Her \ncurrent employment contract is for three years, and she is confident that her income will \nnot decrease during the duration of the contract and may increase. (Tr. 83.) \n \nPolicies \n \nADP positions are sensitive positions, and applicants for ADP positions are entitled \nto the procedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \n\n5 \n \ndetermination may be made. The standard for assignment to sensitive duties is that the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.   \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \n\n6 \n \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to \ndo so\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \nrecent, and the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were not incurred under \ncircumstances making them unlikely to recur. The medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-\n1.g are less likely to recur, because Applicant\u2019s recent marriage entitles her to military \nmedical benefits. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy. It was caused by \nher then husband\u2019s pay reduction and upward adjustment in her mortgage-loan \npayments, which were conditions largely beyond her control. Under the circumstances, \nfiling a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition was a prudent decision.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established for the debts incurred after Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. \nHer marital breakup and the resulting income reduction, unemployment from June to \nNovember 2011, unemployment from April to November 2018, and uninsured medical \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g were conditions largely beyond her control. However, \nher medical debt for laser surgery alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was voluntarily incurred. The \n\n7 \n \nrecord does not reflect why her employment was terminated in April 2018, but there is no \nevidence that it was voluntary or due to any misconduct.  \n \nHowever, Applicant has not acted responsibly regarding the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. The car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b was incurred in December 2011, while \nshe was employed, and she acted responsibly for a while by working second jobs in 2012 \nand 2013. However, she stopped making payments in June or July 2014, well before she \nlost her job in April 2018. She has provided no documentary evidence of any efforts to \nresolve the debt, except for her reliance on a statute of limitations. She provided no \nevidence of efforts to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c until after the hearing, and she has \nmade no payments on the debt. She did not resolve the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d and 1.e until after she received the SOR.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Other than the financial counseling required by the \nbankruptcy court in 2008, she presented no evidence of financial counseling, and her \nfinancial situation is not under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, \nwhich Applicant resolved before she received the SOR. She claimed that the creditor \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b told her that it would not attempt to collect the debt because it was \nbarred by the statute of limitations, but she submitted no evidence to support her claim. \nFurthermore, reliance on the non-collectability because of a statute of limitations does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt. ISCR Case No. 11-08274 (App. Bd. May \n2, 2013).  \n \nApplicant submitted a specific plan to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but she \nsubmitted no evidence that the creditor had agreed to the plan and no evidence of any \npayments under the plan. Her resolution of the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and \n1.e after she received the SOR does not amount to a good-faith effort. Evidence of past \nirresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for \na public trust position. An applicant who does not resolve debts until an application for a \npublic trust position is in jeopardy may lack the good judgment expected of those with \naccess to sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) \nciting ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017).  \n \nApplicant has made some progress in attaining financial stability, tracking down \nand resolving several medical debts. However, she has not established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility. She testified that she had a plan to resolve all her debts and that \nthe plan was laid out in a detailed spreadsheet, but she did not submit it at the hearing or \nin her post-hearing submission.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant claimed that she disputed the amount of \nthe medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but she provided no documentation to support her \nclaim. However, she eventually settled the debt. She has not disputed any of the other \ndebts alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public \ntrust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).3  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns \nraised by her delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant her eligibility for a public \ntrust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for a public trust position is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Minster, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 11 November 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the\n2\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 20\nJuly 2017 and I convened a hearing 30 August 2017. DOHA received the transcript 7\nSeptember 2017, and the record closed.\nConsisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-4, and hearing exhibit (HE) I.\n1\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. However, on 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8\nJune 2017. My decision is the same under both guidelines.\n1\n   12/17/2018\n\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 58-year-old industrial security\nspecialist employed by a U.S. defense contractor since June 2016. He has been\nemployed in related positions since February 1999, with periods of unemployment from\nJanuary-June 2011 and January-June 2016. He has previously had favorable\nbackground investigations in June 2002 and July 2009. This is a periodic reinvestigation\nof that clearance (GE 1).\nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits six\ndelinquent debts totaling over $122,000. The debts comprise a $20,619 Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) tax lien filed in May 2010,  and five delinquent education loans\n3\ntotaling $101,629. Applicant obtained the education loans to pay for his children\u2019s\ncollege expenses. Applicant disclosed the fact, but not the amount, of the tax lien on his\nAugust 2014 clearance application (GE 1). He did not disclose any delinquent education\nloans on his clearance application, but discussed them with a Government investigator\nduring a February 2015 interview (GE 2) based on an August 2014 credit report (GE 4).\nApplicant\u2019s July 2016 credit report (GE 3) reflects the education loan amounts alleged in\nthe SOR. Applicant\u2019s January 2017 Answer contains a December 2016 loan account\nstatement showing a $103,546 combined principal balance.  \n4\nApplicant attributed his financial problems to being laid off in January 2011. At\nthe time, he was making $145,000-150,000 annually, and was generally not having any\nproblems keeping up with his financial obligations. He received an unstated amount of\nseverance pay (GE 2). He was unemployed until June 2016, when he obtained\nemployment paying $125,000 annually. In January 2012, he obtained a different job,\nearning $128,000 annually. In January 2016, he resigned that position, and remained\nunemployed until June 2016, when he obtained his current position, earning $124,000\nannually (Tr. 41).\nApplicant did not explain why he had Federal income tax liens filed against him in\n2010, only that his January 2011 layoff made it difficult for him to keep up his payment\nplan, which he otherwise did not document. Similarly, during his February 2015\ninterview, he claimed to have just arranged a repayment plan on his education loans, to\npay $120 monthly. He could not recall the start or payoff dates for his repayment plan\n(GE 2). At hearing, he claimed, without corroboration to be paying $1,000 monthly\nthrough direct withdrawal for about the last six months (Tr. 35-36).\nApplicant had two other tax liens filed in 2010, which were satisfied (GE 4). Also not alleged in the SOR,\n3\nApplicant had state tax garnishments issued against him in March and July 2013, which were satisfied. He\nhad a June 2014 garnishment order for $91,464.12 in delinquent education loans. In June 2014, he had a\n$27,826 IRS levy for tax years 2005-2007 (GE 2). Applicant provided no independent documentation of his\ncurrent tax status.\nThe account statement showed no past-due amounts. The $1,100 January monthly payment included unpaid\n4\nfees, not otherwise specified. \n2\n\nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a\nbudget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence of community\ninvolvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.5\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant failed to fully mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s unresolved May 2010\nIRS tax lien highlights ongoing tax issues which Applicant has neither explained nor\ndocumented any resolution of. These issues appear to predate his January 2011 layoff,\nand the subsequent decline in income explains only the difficulty meeting any\nrepayment obligations undertaken, not the need for a repayment plan. Similarly, the\ndecline in income explains why the education loans fell delinquent, but does not\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n3\n\ndocument any repayment efforts undertaken upon regaining employment, albeit at\nreduced salary.6\nApplicant \nonly \npartially \nmeets \nthe \nmitigating \nconditions \nfor \nfinancial\nconsiderations. The precipitating layoff occurred over six years ago, not recent, and the\ncircumstances are not likely to recur.  However, while the circumstances of that layoff\n7\nwere beyond his control,  he has not documented that he behaved responsibly under\n8\nthe circumstances. As early as February 2015, Applicant claimed to have taken steps to\nresolve his IRS and education loan issues, but aside from a single data point in\nDecember 2016, he has not documented the claimed regular payments on his\neducation loans or documented any actions taken regarding the IRS lien.9\n \nApplicant has neither claimed nor documented any credit or financial counseling,\nand there is a dearth of evidence to show that his financial problems have been\nresolved or are under control.  This failure of evidence precludes a conclusion that\n10\nApplicant has made a good-faith effort to address his debts.  Moreover, he submitted\n11\nno work or character evidence which might support a whole-person assessment to\novercome the security concerns raised by his conduct. I conclude Guideline F against\nApplicant.\n Formal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history\n6\nof not meeting financial obligations; (e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible\nspending . . . ;\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n7\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \nBut not so his January 2016 resignation from his job, the financial impact of which Applicant did not\n8\ndocument.\n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n9\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . .  and there are clear indications\n10\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n11\nresolve debts.\n4\n\nConclusion\nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Clearance denied.  \n                                              \n                                             \nJOHN GRATTAN METZ, JR\nAdministrative Judge\n5\n",

Morris, Esq. \n09/18/2019 \nDecision \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines I (Psychological \nConditions), G (Alcohol Consumption) and E (Personal Conduct). Applicant mitigated \nthe Guideline G and E security concerns, but he has not mitigated the Guideline I \nsecurity concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 1, 2014. \nAfter an extensive background investigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February \n20, 2019, alleging security concerns under Guidelines I, G, and E. The DOD CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n\n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 22, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 19, 2019, \nand the case was assigned to me on April 23, 2019. On May 8, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 12, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 9 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified, presented the testimony of five witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AX) A through R, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on June 20, 2019. \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he could not admit or deny the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and 3.a, because he had not seen the medical \nreports on which the allegations were based. I have treated his answer to these \nallegations as denials. He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.b, 3.b, and 3.d. He \ndenied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.c. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old logistics management specialist employed by a \ndefense contractor since March 2006. He married in 2015, after cohabitating since \n2012. He divorced in 2016. He has a six-year-old child, and he shares custody of the \nchild with his ex-wife. He currently lives with his fianc\u00e9e, who has two children, ages 8 \nand 10. He received a security clearance in August 2009. \n \n \nIn 1997, while Applicant was in high school, he and some friends were at a party, \nand they were mixing liquid drain cleaner with aluminum foil in two-liter plastic bottles. \nThe chemical reaction made the bottles explode. Someone was alarmed by the loud \nnoise and called the police, and Applicant and five others were taken into custody. \nApplicant\u2019s five companions were released to their parents. Because his father was \ntraveling and his mother did not want to drive at night on the highway, Applicant spent \nthe night in juvenile detention. (Tr. 83-84.) \n \n \nApplicant attended college from 1997 to 2001 but did not graduate. He testified \nthat he was very sheltered at home, to the extent that he did not know how to do \nlaundry or balance a checkbook. (Tr. 129.) Around 2000, he began consuming alcohol \ninfrequently, but he quickly increased his consumption to the point of frequent \nintoxication, regularly consuming 7-9 beers at a sitting. (Tr. 84.) \n \n \nOn September 22, 2001, Applicant had been drinking with friends, and he was \nheavily intoxicated. A friend dropped Applicant off at his apartment. While walking to the \napartment, Applicant flicked a lighted cigarette into the bed of a pickup truck parked in a \ncarport and started a fire. The fire spread to the carport and four adjoining residences. \nThe truck and all four residences were destroyed. (GX 9 at 1-2; Tr. 85.) \n \n\n \n \nOn October 10, 2001, after another night of heavy drinking with friends, Applicant \nflicked a cigarette onto the carpet in a hallway of his apartment building and ignited a \nsmall fire that he quickly extinguished. About a week later, he poured hair spray from a \npump bottle into a beer can and ignited it. He stumbled and ignited a fire in the hallway. \nHe was unable to extinguish the fire, and the fire department was summoned. A day \nlater, he dropped a lighted match onto a bed comforter and ignited it. (GX 9 at 2; tr. 85-\n86.)  \n3 \n \n \nIn November 2001, Applicant\u2019s father, who was on active duty at the time, \narranged to have him evaluated by a psychologist in the Navy Addictions Rehabilitation \nDepartment. Applicant told the psychologist that he had been diagnosed with attention \ndeficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a child and treated with medication. He also \ntold the psychologist that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2000 and was \nprescribed medication, but that he stopped taking the medication because he could not \ndrink alcohol while on the medication. He told the psychologist that he had difficulty \ncontrolling anger because of his bipolar disorder. The psychologist did not believe that \nApplicant was open and forthcoming during their interview. He commented that \nApplicant appeared to be seeking help in order to present himself in a positive light in \ncourt. The Navy psychologist diagnosed him with alcohol abuse but did not diagnose \nhim with bipolar disorder. (GX 6.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that he was never \ndiagnosed as bipolar, but he assumed that he was bipolar, because he was given a \nprescription for a drug used to treat bipolar disorder while he was in college. (Tr. 104-\n05, 110.)  \n \nAfter the November 2001 evaluation, Applicant completed a two-week alcohol-\nawareness program, followed by a third week of intensive treatment. (Tr. 89-90.) The \nNavy psychologist recommended that he abstain from alcohol. Applicant testified that \nhe complied with the recommendation. (Tr. 111.) The record does not reflect when he \nresumed drinking or his level of consumption.  He now limits his consumption to one or \ntwo drinks when he and his fianc\u00e9e have a dinner \u201cdate\u201d twice a month. (Tr. 123.) In his \n2014 SCA, he was asked, \u201cHave you EVER received counseling or treatment as a \nresult of your use of alcohol in addition to what you have already listed on this form?\u201d \nHe answered \u201cNo\u201d and did not disclose his treatment in the Navy program. (GX 1 at 35.) \n \nIn September 2002, Applicant was tried for the four fire-related events. He \npleaded guilty to two felony counts of risking a catastrophe, two misdemeanor counts of \nreckless endangerment, and two misdemeanor counts of criminal mischief. Two felony \ncounts of arson were nolle prosequi in accordance with a plea agreement. In October \n2002, he was sentenced to jail for four consecutive sentences of 3-6 months (totaling 12 \nto 24 months) for the two counts of risking a catastrophe and two counts of reckless \nendangerment, and he was sentenced to probation for the two counts of criminal \nmischief. He was in jail until October 2003. (GX 1 at 32-33; GX 7.) \n \nWhile Applicant was awaiting trial, he was employed as a cook in a local tavern. \nThe tavern owner\u2019s son accused Applicant of damaging a restroom. When the owner\u2019s \nson kept questioning Applicant and \u201cgot in his face,\u201d Applicant pushed him away, and an \n\n \n4 \n \naltercation ensued. Applicant had not been drinking because he was at work. Applicant \nwas \u201casked to leave,\u201d but two days later he was rehired. (Tr. 87-88.) No criminal \ncharges were filed. \n \nIn June 2003, while in jail, Applicant completed an alcohol and drug educational \nseminar and a 30-hour wellness-education program presented by the state department \nof corrections. (AX B; AX C.) In May 2011, he received an associate\u2019s degree in \nbusiness management. In November 2012, he was on the dean\u2019s list for the winter term, \nand he was inducted into a national technical honor society. In December 2013, he \nreceived an associate\u2019s degree in information security technology. (AX D-H.) \n \nApplicant started seeking psychotherapy around 2011-2012, after he learned that \nhis ex-wife was pregnant by her ex-husband. (Tr. 97.) He started having panic attacks, \nand his psychotherapist prescribed an anti-anxiety medication. (Tr. 93.) He did not \ndisclose his treatment for anxiety in his 2014 SCA, apparently because it was related to \nhis marital problems. (GX 1 at 29.) \n \nIn May 2014, Applicant was involved in an altercation with a fellow worker that \nwas triggered when his fellow worker played a practical joke by disconnecting all the \ncables from Applicant\u2019s computer. Applicant was convicted of assault and battery. He \nwas fined, placed on administrative leave, and was permanently barred from entering \nthe military installation where he had been working. The permanent bar was later \nreduced to six months. (Tr. 108-09; GX 2; GX 3 at 20. In August 2014, he completed a \n12-week psycho-educational program in anger management. (AX A.) \n \nIn February 2018, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist at \nthe request of the DOD CAF. The psychologist commented that Applicant was not \ntruthful and forthcoming during the evaluation. She noted that he denied ever having \nsymptoms of ADHD, and that he did not disclose his treatment for anxiety in his SCA. \nShe administered a personality assessment inventory but found that the results were \nnot interpretable because the validity scales indicated that he was presenting himself in \nan unrealistically favorable light. She reported that Applicant admitted starting only one \nfire and claimed that he was present at the other fires but did not start them. She \nreviewed his medical records, which reflected that a psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant \nwith bipolar disorder in 2000. She also commented that Applicant\u2019s medical records \nreflect that he frequently admitted that he was diagnosed as bipolar. She stated her \nability to make a definitive diagnosis was limited, because Applicant appeared to have \nwithheld information about his mental health history. She concluded that Applicant \u201chas \nmental, emotional, or personality conditions that could impair judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Her diagnosis was (1) alcohol use disorder, remission status unknown; \n(2) bipolar disorder, most recent episode depressed; and (3) anxiety disorder, \nunspecified. (GX 4.) \n \nA long-time friend and former co-worker describes Applicant as sincere, kind-\nhearted, trustworthy, and hardworking. She describes him as a \u201cdoting father and caring \nfriend.\u201d (AX J.) A deputy sheriff and former classmate considers Applicant trustworthy, \n\n \ncommitted, and hardworking. (AX K.) A friend who has known him for more than 25 \nyears considers him trustworthy, dedicated, hardworking, compassionate, and a \nwonderful father. (AX L.) A friend who has known him for more than 30 years considers \nhim caring, determined, and hardworking. (AX M.) Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e knows him as an \nhonest and hardworking person and a loving father for his daughter as well as her two \nchildren. (AX N.)  \n5 \n \n \nA psychologist, who has known Applicant for about nine years, submitted a letter \nattesting to his positive attitude and integrity through difficult times and his honesty and \nloyalty to family and country. The psychologist\u2019s relationship with Applicant has been \none of friendship rather than professional. (AX O.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, a retired U.S. Navy officer, is a co-owner and vice-president of \nthe company for whom Applicant works. He submitted a statement describing \nApplicant\u2019s discovery that his daughter was molested by her half-brother, his \nsubsequent divorce, and the contentious custody battle that followed the divorce. He \nstates that Applicant was diagnosed as a child with ADHD without hyperactivity. He \nstates that Applicant has never been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder or alcohol \ndependence. He describes Applicant as a loving father, and he describes Applicant\u2019s \nfianc\u00e9e as a \u201cwonderful woman.\u201d (AX P.) \n \nIn November 2018, Applicant was evaluated by a qualified medical health \nprofessional and was administered a substance-abuse subtle-screening inventory \n(SASSI-4) and determined to have a low probability of a substance-abuse disorder. The \nSASSI reflected a \u201cmoderate clinical issue with defensiveness,\u201d but the clinician who \nadministered the SASSI did not observe any remarkable defensiveness during the \nadministration of the SASSI or the biopsychosocial assessment. The evaluator did not \nrecommend substance-abuse treatment. (AX Q.) \n \nApplicant received psychotherapy from three medical professionals between \nNovember 2017 and March 2019. He saw the first therapist 15 times and was \ndiagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), \nand adjustment disorder with anxiety. He was transferred to another therapist after the \nfirst therapist starting seeing his daughter, who had accused her half-brother of sexually \nmolesting her.  \n \nStarting in August 2018, the second therapist saw him six times and diagnosed \nhim with generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, and major depressive disorder, recurrent \nand moderate. This therapist attributed his PTSD in large part to trauma during his \nprevious marriage and the contentious divorce that followed. He is now considered \nemotionally stable, but occasionally is affected by stress and depression, mostly when \nhe and his ex-wife have conflicts in their co-parenting. He continues to receive \npsychotherapy for anger management. He is in the clinical range for anxiety and PTSD, \nbut his aggressive tendencies and anger are in the non-clinical range. He has no \nindication of an alcohol-abuse disorder and is not bipolar. This therapist concludes by \nstating that Applicant\u2019s \u201ccurrent mental health assessments, observations, mental health \n\n \ntreatment, and his personal commitment to change via training place [him] in a \nfavorable light.\u201d She continues to treat Applicant and sees him every two or three weeks \nfor about an hour. (Tr. 19-20.) She has never seen symptoms of a bipolar disorder. She \ngives him a \u201cgood\u201d prognosis. (Tr. 20-23.) \n6 \n \n \nA third therapist evaluated Applicant in December 2018. He diagnosed Applicant \nwith adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct, which was \nconsidered an improvement from the two previous evaluations. (AX R.) \n \nApplicant testified that he takes an anti-anxiety medication every morning. \nAlthough his prescription allows him to take the medication \u201cas needed,\u201d he has not \nneeded to take a second dose during the day. If he feels a sense of conflict, he has \nlearned to walk away, talk to himself, and ask himself how he should handle it. He no \nlonger needs to \u201charbor everything inside anymore.\u201d Instead, he talks to one of his close \nfriends. (Tr. 93-94.) \n \nThe co-owner of the company by whom Applicant is employed has known him \nsince he was first employed in 2006. She owns 51% of the company and Applicant\u2019s \nfather owns 49%. She is aware of the Applicant\u2019s incarceration in 2002 and his \naltercation with a fellow employee in 2014. She believes that the co-worker, a known \ntrouble-maker who is no longer employed by the company, was partly to blame for the \n2014 incident. She believes that Applicant has matured since he was first hired. She \nconsiders him emotionally stable, honest, reliable, and trustworthy. She has seen no \nsigns of alcohol abuse. (Tr. 39-45.)  \n \nA close friend of Applicant, who served on active duty in the Navy with \nApplicant\u2019s father, has known Applicant since 2000. She visited Applicant when he was \nincarcerated. For the past three years, they have had monthly job-related contact and \npersonal contact about every other month. She considers Applicant honest, reliable, \nand hardworking. She believes he has good judgment. She has never observed any \nemotional instability or excessive alcohol consumption. She believes Applicant was \nremorseful about his mistakes and has worked hard to turn his life around. She testified \nshe would hire him \u201cin a minute without hesitation. (Tr. 50-56,) \n \nA co-worker, who is a retired master chief petty officer, has had daily personal \nand professional contact with Applicant since September 2018. They have become \nclose friends. They have discussed Applicant\u2019s past conduct, including the arson \nincidents in 2002, the altercation in 2014, and his current mental health treatment. The \nco-worker testified that he considers Applicant\u2019s reliability \u201cabove reproach,\u201d and he has \ncomplete trust in his judgment. He has no doubts about Applicant\u2019s emotional stability. \n(Tr. 62-72.)  \n \nApplicant has held a second job as a contractor, on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis, for \nabout four years for a company that owns four radio stations. His supervisor has \nprofessional contact with him \u201cevery month at least\u201d and social contact every month or \ntwo. His supervisor browsed the SOR but did not read it carefully. He has never seen \n\n \nApplicant intoxicated. He considers Applicant mature, trustworthy, reliable, \u201chonest to a \nfault,\u201d and a person with good judgment. He testified that Applicant had \u201csome issues\u201d \nduring his divorce proceedings, but he is usually \u201cvery even-keeled.\u201d (Tr. 73-81.) \n7 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n\n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n8 \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that, in January 2018, Applicant was evaluated and diagnosed \nwith alcohol use disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also \nalleges that, in around 2001, Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol abuse and bipolar \ndisorder (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Both allegations are established by the evidence submitted at the \nhearing. \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not \nrequired for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. . . .  \n \n \nI have considered the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other \nguideline and that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality \ncondition, including, but not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, \nsuicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, \nexploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; and \n \n\n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 28(d): failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a \ndiagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure \nto take prescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling \nsessions. \n \nAG \u00b6 28(a) is not applicable because it applies only to behavior \u201cnot covered \nunder any other guideline.\u201d Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct was not alleged under \nGuideline J, but it was alleged under Guideline E and is addressed below under that \nguideline. AG \u00b6 28(b) is established by the multiple mental-health evaluations reflected \nin the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing. AG \u00b6 28(d) is established for \nApplicant\u2019s discontinuance of his medication for bipolar disorder, and his decision to \nresume alcohol consumption after being advised in 2001 to abstain from alcohol. This \ndisqualifying condition is not established for Applicant\u2019s mental-health issues after they \nwere identified in 2011 and thereafter, because the evidence indicates that Applicant \ncomplied with all treatment recommendations.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \n \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or \ntreatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the \nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional; \n \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, \nthe situation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(b) are established by the testimony and documentary \nevidence provided by Applicant\u2019s current therapists. AG \u00b6 29(c) is not \nestablished, because the health professional employed by the U.S. Government \nprovided an unfavorable diagnosis. This unfavorable diagnosis is not overcome \nby the generally favorable testimony of Applicant\u2019s therapists. His therapists \nattribute his ongoing PTSD and depression to emotional trauma during his \n\n \n10 \n \nprevious marriage and continuing conflicts with his ex-wife about co-parenting \nissues. \n \nApplicant\u2019s lack of candor with the U.S. Government psychologist raises a \nquestion whether he has been candid with his own therapists. Furthermore, to \nthe extent that there is doubt about the low probability of recurrence, the doubt \nmust be resolved in favor of national security. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n29(d) and 29(e) are not established, because Applicant continues to deal with \nPTSD, anxiety, depression, and anger management. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the diagnoses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). It also alleges that Applicant had been consuming alcohol at the time of the \ncriminal incidents alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.b (SOR \u00b6 2.b). These allegations are supported by \nthe evidence submitted at the hearing. He admitted SOR \u00b6 2.b in his answer to the \nSOR. \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(b): alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or \nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or \njeopardizing the welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(e): the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(f): alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \n\n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are established. Applicant was heavily intoxicated when \nthe various fire-related incidents occurred in September 2001. \n11 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(b) is not established. Applicant was at work but had not been drinking \nwhen the 2001 altercation in the tavern occurred. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d) is established. Applicant was diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder \nby the Navy psychologist in 2001 and during the DOD CAF mental status evaluation in \nFebruary 2018. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) and 22(f) are established by the Navy psychologist\u2019s \nrecommendation in 2001 that Applicant abstain from consuming alcohol. The \npsychologist who conducted DOD CAF evaluation diagnosed Applicant with an \u201calcohol \nuse disorder, remission status unknown,\u201d but she made no treatment recommendations. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment \nprogram along with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident was in October \n2001, and there is no evidence of recurrence. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) are established. Applicant acknowledged his excessive \ndrinking in college and completed the Navy rehabilitation program. He followed the \ntreatment recommendation for abstinence for a time. The record does not reflect when \nhe resumed his consumption of alcohol, but it does reflect that he is now an occasional \nand moderate drinker. The DOD CAF evaluation includes a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, \nbut the only evidence in the record suggesting that Applicant is alcohol dependent is the \nNavy psychologist\u2019s recommendation in November 2001 that he abstain from alcohol. \nHis conduct since November 2001 does not reflect alcohol dependence. \n \n\n \n12 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2 under this guideline (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and \n3.b). It SOR further alleges that Applicant was terminated from employment in 2002 for \nengaging in an altercation with another employee and for destruction of property (SOR \n\u00b6 3.c). Finally, the SOR alleges that in May 2014, Applicant was charged with simple \nassault and battery following a physical altercation with a co-worker, that he pleaded \nguilty, that he was ordered to pay a fine, and that he was removed from working on a \ncontract and barred from the military base on which he had been working (SOR \u00b6 3.d). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \n\n \n13 \n \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) \nany disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; [and] (3) a pattern \nof dishonesty or rule violations . . . . ; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \n \nThe February 2018 evaluation by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed the U.S. Government included a conclusion that Applicant withheld \ninformation, provided false information, and intentionally invalidated the personality \nassessment inventory. This evidence ordinarily would raise the concerns in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15(a), 15(b), and 16(a), but Applicant\u2019s lack of candor with the Government psychologist \nwas not alleged in the SOR and may not be an independent basis for denying a \nclearance. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an \napplicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; \nto evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-\nperson analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s lack of candor with the Government psychologist for these \nlimited purposes.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct in 2001 and 2014 raises the concerns in AG 16(c), \n16(d), and 16(e). The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \n\n \n14 \n \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are established for the three fire-related incidents in \nSeptember-October 2001. These incidents cased serious property damage and, \nendangered others. They resulted in felony convictions and a year in jail. However, they \noccurred 18 years ago. They were the product of Applicant\u2019s heavy alcoholic \nintoxication, and he has significantly modified his alcohol consumption since his release \nfrom jail.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are established for Applicant\u2019s barroom affray in 2002, \nwhich was minor and mitigated by the passage of time without recurrence. They also \nare established for the altercation with a co-worker in 2014, which occurred more than \nfive years ago, was instigated in large part by the coworker, and has not recurred. \nApplicant is now working in a supportive environment for a company co-owned by his \nfather and a close friend, and he is surrounded by friendly and supportive co-workers, \nmaking further workplace violence unlikely. AG \u00b6 17(e) is established by Applicant\u2019s full \ndisclosure of his criminal conduct.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines I, G, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines I, G, and E, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \n\n \nsecurity concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and personal conduct, but he has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his psychological conditions. \n15 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I (Psychological Conditions): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 38 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005, and a master\u2019s degree in 2007. Applicant was married in 2003 and divorced in 2009. He remarried in 2009. He has a daughter, age 12, and an adult stepdaughter, age 21. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in March 2003. He was on active duty until December 2005, when he received an honorable discharge due to hardship. He joined the Navy Reserve in February 2010, and in October 2012, he resigned his commission due to a pending Federal investigation. While serving as a government contracting officer in Iraq, Applicant had been accused of setting up a sham company, bribery, and receiving monetary kickbacks for awarding contacts to companies involved in the scheme.

National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n Statement of the Case \nOn August 26, 2014, and August 3, 2017, Applicant submitted security clearance \napplications (SCA). On March 6, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 23, 2018, and he provided four documents \nwith his response. He admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.f, and denied \u00b6 1.a.   \nApplicant obtained counsel and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel provided discovery and an amendment to the SOR to Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n2 \n \n \nCounsel by letter dated November 5, 2018. The amendment included SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - 1.n; \nall falsification allegations cited under Guideline E. On November 30, 2018, Applicant \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - 1.n. On December 31, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for January 17, 2019. \nOn January 4, 2019, the case was assigned to me. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibit (GE) 1-14, \nbut only GE 1-10 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s Counsel \nobjected to GE 11-14, as noted under Procedural Matters addressed below. In addition, \nCounsel offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) B, C, E, F, G, and L,1 which I admitted into \nevidence without objection. (Tr. 26-32) Applicant called his wife to testify on his behalf. I \nheld the record open until February 17, 2019, in the event either party wanted to submit \nadditional documentation. On January 22, 2019, Applicant\u2019s counsel provided two \nadditional documents. I admitted AE M and N into evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 28, 2019, and the record was closed on \nFebruary 17, 2019. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel objected to GE 11-14, which are reports of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground interviews during various security clearance investigations. Applicant\u2019s \nCounsel believed the reports of subject interview were incomplete reports, and claimed \nthe falsification allegations were taken out of context. Department Counsel stated that \nthe subject interview reports were complete summary reports, but Applicant\u2019s Counsel\u2019s \nclaim of \u201cstatements taken out of context\u201d was due to him not receiving Applicant\u2019s \nentire report of investigation. (ROI) She correctly noted that DOHA is not authorized to \nprovide the entire ROI since it is the property of Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM). I reviewed GE 11-14, and I determined that the summary of Applicant\u2019s \ninterview was complete in all four documents. The summary covered the beginning, \nmiddle, and the end of Applicant\u2019s interview, without any missing pages. Of course, the \ninterviews are summaries and are not verbatim. They do not provide complete \ninformation from the interviews. I also advised Applicant\u2019s Counsel to clearly state \nduring Applicant\u2019s testimony if there were any discrepancies in the summary of the \nbackground interviews, which I would take into consideration. (Tr. 20-25) \n \n \nThe subject interview summary is an investigative report produced by OPM, a \nFederal government agency. OPM is required to complete subject interviews in the \nDOD security clearance investigations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are of a party opponent \nand according to Federal Rule of Evidence (Fed. R. Evid.) 801(d)(2), they are not \nhearsay. In the alternative, the summary is admissible as a record of a regularly \nrecurring activity\u2013in this case a security clearance investigation under Fed. R. Evid. \n803(6). ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2019). [Except OPM \ninvestigative records. See n. 3.] Thus, I overruled Counsel\u2019s objection to the four subject \n                                                          \n1 Some tabs from Applicant\u2019s notebook of exhibits were removed prior to the hearing. The notebook \ncontained a table of contents, but not all of the tabs listed in the table of contents were included in the \nnotebook that was provided to me at the hearing. \n\n \n3 \n \n \ninterview summaries of Applicant. I admitted GE 11-14 into evidence, and I have \naccorded the facts therein the appropriate weight given the record as a whole.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  Applicant is 38 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005, and \na master\u2019s degree in 2007. Applicant was married in 2003 and divorced in 2009. He \nremarried in 2009. He has a daughter, age 12, and an adult stepdaughter, age 21. \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in March 2003. He was on active duty until \nDecember 2005, when he received an honorable discharge due to hardship. He joined \nthe Navy Reserve in February 2010, and in October 2012, he resigned his commission \ndue to a pending Federal investigation. While serving as a government contracting \nofficer in Iraq, Applicant had been accused of setting up a sham company, bribery, and \nreceiving monetary kickbacks for awarding contacts to companies involved in the \nscheme. He could not be promoted in the Navy Reserves while a Federal investigation \nwas on-going, and he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 12-14, 33, 38, 42, 46-48, \n77-78, 119, 121-122; GE 1, GE 3-6; AE M, AE N) \n \nSince 2012, Applicant is the chief executive officer and 51% service disabled \nveteran owner of a federal consulting company that has 150 employees and does $10 \nmillion in business annually. He manages many different operations in the company. \nApplicant does not currently possess a DOD security clearance, but he previously held \na DOD security clearance and a DOD facility clearance until 2015. Applicant is \nrequesting that he be granted a personal DOD security clearance, and as Key \nManagement Personnel, his company could then be granted a DOD facility clearance. \n(Tr. 12-14, 33, 38, 46-49, 77-78; GE 1) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.a alleges that in 2009, while Applicant was working as a U.S. \nGovernment Contracting Officer in Iraq, he was investigated for bribery and conspiracy \nto commit bribery. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied this allegation, and also \nnoted that this adverse information occurred a decade ago. On May 18, 2015, Applicant \nreceived notice via certified mail from the U.S. Army Procurement Fraud Division that \nafter completion of a Federal investigation, Applicant and his company were being \nconsidered for debarment from future contracting with any agency in the Executive \nbranch of the U.S. Government. (AE M) He denied receiving any notice from the \nGovernment. He found out about the proposed debarment from his business partner, \nwho had checked the website listing debarred federal contractors and individuals. (Tr. \n97-98) Applicant obtained counsel, disputed the findings of the investigation, and \nargued that debarment was not appropriate in this matter. (AE N) On February 25, \n2016, the U.S. Army Procurement Fraud Division agreed to establish an administrative \ncompliance agreement, and required Applicant to take a business ethics course. (SOR \nresponse attachment 2)  A Memorandum from the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI), dated August 6, 2012, stated that although there was not \nenough corroboration obtained during the investigation to charge Applicant with bribery, \nand attempted bribery, the case agents from FBI, Defense Criminal Investigative \n\n \n4 \n \n \nServices, Army Criminal Investigation Command, and Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction believe that Applicant was involved in criminal activity. (Tr. 95-102; GE \n3-7; AE C, AE M, AE N)  \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.b alleges that in 2011, while Applicant was employed as an \nemployee of the United States Peace Corps, he accessed pornographic websites on his \nassigned government computer. Applicant admitted this allegation in his response to the \nSOR. He stated that he had just filed a complaint with the Office of Inspector General \n(OIG) against his supervisor for selling illegal drugs to Peace Corps employees, \nnepotism, and possible contract fraud. She also discriminated against military members. \nApplicant testified that his supervisor asked him directly if he wanted to be part of a \ncontract bribery scam. After hearing her offer, Applicant admitted to being \nunprofessional, and he said some curse words to his supervisor. He claimed his \nsupervisor then placed him on a performance improvement plan. (PIP) About three \nweeks after he filed an OIG complaint against his supervisor, a computer check \nrevealed that Applicant had been visiting pornography websites on his work computer. \nThere were also allegations of him reporting to work late and leaving work early. \nApplicant was called into an office with an OIG representative, and he signed the \npaperwork that was provided to him. He said the paper included an admission of guilt, \nwhich he agreed to sign since he was guilty of accessing pornographic websites on his \nwork computer. Applicant noted that he signed the paperwork without the benefit of \nhaving legal representation. (Tr. 60-70)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his employment with \nthe U.S. Peace Corps when he completed his 2014 SCA. Applicant denied this \nallegation, and believes the omission was either a computer glitch, the result of a \u201cgag \norder\u201d he thought was in effect, or just oversite. SOR \u00b6 1.m alleges that during his \nbackground interview in September 2014, Applicant volunteered information about his \nemployment with the U.S. Peace Corps. When initially asked by the investigator \nwhether he had any difficulties with this employment, Applicant denied any difficulties, \nand said no one from the Peace Corps would question his conduct or behavior at this \nemployment. He did not violate any oral, written or otherwise recorded agreements \nmade with this employer. He admitted to the investigator that he clicked on links \nprovided by his father which, unbeknownst to him, turned out to be pornographic \nwebsites. At the hearing, Applicant accepted full responsibility for intentionally visiting \npornographic websites on his government computer. He did not disclose on his SCA \nthat he was terminated for accessing pornography on his government computer. (Tr. 70-\n73, 102-103, 107-108, 124-127; 136-137, 139; GE 2, GE 11; AE L) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n alleges that Applicant intentionally lied to the investigator during his \nbackground interview in September 2014 when he told the investigator that he had been \nemployed by the Peace Corps, but he was under a gag order and could no longer \ndiscuss his employment with the Peace Corps during his interview. Applicant stated that \nhe believed the gag order was valid, and he was required to keep his \u201cmouth shut.\u201d (Tr. \n70-73, 102-103,109,136; GE 2, GE 11; AE L)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges that Applicant falsified his 2017 SCA when he answered \u201cno\u201d \nto the question if within the last seven years, had he ever received a written warning, \nbeen officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace. \nApplicant denied this allegation. He believed he was under a \u201cgag order\u201d and could not \ndisclose any information about his misconduct while employed by the U.S. Peace \nCorps. He claimed paragraph 3, of an unsigned settlement agreement, (AE L) was the \ndriving force in this matter. Applicant said he also knew this adverse information was \nreadily available during his investigation, so he was not attempting to hide this \ninformation. Later during the hearing, Applicant stated that he did not know the exact \ntime period, and going back 7 years, he should have listed his misconduct for viewing \npornography while employed by the Peace Corps, but he mistakenly missed the seven-\nyear cut-off by \u201cdays.\u201d Applicant did not list his termination from the Peace Corps for \nviewing pornography on the SCA. He stated he was not trying to hide the information. \nAfter reading Paragraph 3 of AE L, I find that it does not contain any language which \nwould prevent Applicant from discussing his Peace Corps employment misconduct \nduring the course of his background investigation. (Tr. 60-73, 104, 129, 140-14; GE 1, \nGE 2; AE L, paragraph 3)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges Applicant falsified material facts during a December 2011 \nsubject interview when he told the investigator that he was under a gag order as a result \nof a lawsuit he filed against the Peace Corps. He had filed a complaint against the \nPeace Corps and the matter was settled out of court. He could not provide additional \ninformation, due to a gag order issued by the presiding judge. (GE 14) In addition, \nApplicant deliberately withheld the circumstances that led to him being placed on paid \nadministrative leave, due to viewing pornographic websites on his government \ncomputer. Applicant testified that he has always admitted his misconduct of viewing \npornography whenever questioned, and also admitted he lost his employment position \ndue to viewing pornography. Later in the hearing, Applicant said he was not forthcoming \nwith his pornography misconduct due to the gag order, and he recommended the \ninvestigator obtain his employment history directly from the Peace Corps. (Tr. 73-75, \n105, 113) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.l alleges that Applicant gave conflicting accounts during his \nbackground interviews concerning the circumstances of viewing pornography on his \nwork computer. During his March 2012 interview, Applicant told the investigator that he \nhad looked at pornographic sites on his Government computer when he was on his \npersonal e-mail account. The websites were sent to him by his military friends. He did \nnot consider viewing pornographic websites from his personal e-mail a problem or in \nviolation of any policy. During his September 2014 background interview, Applicant said \nhe clicked on links provided by his father, which he did not know contained \npornographic as well as shopping websites. (Tr. 106-107; GE 11, GE 13) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant was counseled while employed with \nU.S. General Services Administration (GSA) for misuse of his Government credit card. \nIn 2012, his employment with GSA was terminated. Applicant admitted this allegation in \nresponse to the SOR. He denied that the misuse of his Government credit card was \n\n \n6 \n \n \nintentional. His wife inadvertently pulled this credit card out of a stack of personal credit \ncards Applicant kept at home. When GSA notified him of the fraudulent activity, he \nimmediately paid the balance billed to his Government credit card. He claimed to have \nself-reported the misuse of his Government credit card to his supervisor. His supervisor \ntold Applicant that this incident was a minor issue. Applicant was later called into an \noffice with his supervisor and the chief of staff, approximately six weeks before the \nexpiration of his employment probationary period. They asked him to commit contract \nfraud, which he immediately refused. The chief of staff slipped a piece of paper to him, \nand he discovered that he was being placed on a PIP for insubordination, and misuse of \na Government credit card. Applicant stated he turned over the PIP document and wrote \nthat he immediately resigned his position with GSA. Before he walked out of the room, \nhe was told that he could not resign from a government job. It was his understanding \nthat he resigned from GSA. Upon further question at the hearing, Applicant was asked \nwhy he had denied being fired from GSA, as he indicated that he thought he was simply \nlet go during his probationary period. Applicant said this statement was correct, as he \nwas unsure of his status when he left employment with GSA. (Tr. 76-77, 83-93, 146; AE \nE) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.h alleges that Applicant falsified his 2014 SCA when he listed \nthat he left employment with GSA to start his own business. SOR \u00b6 1.i alleges Applicant \nfalsified information on the same SCA when he denied he was fired, quit after being told \nhe would be fired, or left employment by mutual agreement for misconduct or \nunsatisfactory performance. (GE 2) Applicant denied these allegations. He did start his \ncompany after leaving GSA, and he had resigned from his position. (Tr. 93-95, 103-104, \n127-128) \n \nDuring the hearing, his attorney asked Applicant:  \n \nCounsel: \u201cAnd it was your understanding that you resigned and they \n(GSA) said no, you can\u2019t resign.\u201d \n \nApplicant: \u201cThat is correct.\u201d \n \nCounsel: \u201cAnd they fired you.\u201d \n \nApplicant: \u201cThat is correct.\u201d \n \nCounsel: \u201cBut you weren\u2019t aware of that?\u201d \n \nApplicant: \u201cNo I wasn\u2019t. Once again I didn\u2019t hire legal counsel. Once \nagain [I] walked out of the building the same day.\u201d (Tr. 93) \n \n\u2026and later during the hearing:  \n \nCounsel: \u201cAnd it says when in fact you were terminated from that \n(GSA) position. Did you understand you were terminated?\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant: \u201cNo, not at that time I did not know I was terminated.\u201d (Tr. \n103) \n \nOn the 2017 SCA completed by Applicant, he listed his reason for leaving \nGSA as follows: \n \nI was terminated for insubordination. I was asked by my entire team \nof executives to illegally award several contracts, valued in the $100s \nof millions of dollars, to companies of their choosing. I told them that \nit was illegal, and that I respectfully refused. When I did that, I was \nstill under my \u20181 year probationary\u2019 period, and was terminated from \nmy employment.\u201d (GE 1 pg. 14) [ \n \nOn page 15 of his 2017 SCA, Applicant said, \u201c\u2026When I refused, respectfully, I was \nissued termination papers, and left the same day. If I had to do it again, I would do \nit EXACTLY the same way. No questions.\u201d \n \nDuring the hearing Applicant was questioned about his contradictory statements. \nHe stated that he learned much later that he had been terminated by GSA in 2012. \nWhen he filled out the SCA in 2014, he reflected that termination information he just \nonly recently discovered. When asked how he found out about his termination from \nGSA, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t remember. There\u2019s somehow I did find out. I don\u2019t remember. I \ndon\u2019t recall.\u201d (Tr. 147-149) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant was arrested in May 2012 for assault \nof a family member (wife). Applicant testified that during this time he was having \ndifficulty with his wife. He claimed she was addicted to illegal drugs. He admitted during \nthe hearing to being arrested in state A for having an open container in public, but he \ndenied ever being arrested in May 2012 or convicted of domestic assault. (Tr. 49-52) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview in January 2013, he told the investigator that \nhis neighbors called the police whenever he and his wife got into a loud argument. The \npolice were called three times to their apartment, and his wife was arrested on all three \noccasions. Applicant stated he was never arrested or charged with domestic \ndisturbance on any of those occasions. (GE 12) State A criminal record and an FBI \nidentification record both show that Applicant was arrested in May 2012 for assault of a \nfamily member. Two months later, in July 2012, the charge was nolle prossed. (GE 9-\n10) Applicant did not disclose his May 2012 arrest for assault of a family member on his \n2014 or 2017 SCA. (GE 1-2) It is important to note that during his interview in \nSeptember 2014, Applicant provided a different account of the incident. He stated the \npolice were called to their apartment in May 2012 due a loud argument, and the policy \nof State A police is that one of the individuals involved in the domestic disturbance must \nbe arrested if the police are called to investigate. In May 2012, Applicant volunteered \n(emphasis added) to go with the police because his wife already had several criminal \nconvictions. He spent about eight hours in jail, he met with a magistrate, paid a fine, and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwas then released. Applicant did not list the arrest on the SCA as he was unaware that \nhe had been charged with any criminal offense. (GE 11)  \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant was arrested in December 2015 for \nassault of a family member (wife). As indicated previously, Applicant claimed the \nneighbors called the police on multiple occasions whenever he and his wife got into a \nloud argument. On this particular night, he and his wife were having a loud verbal \nargument. He left the residence and stayed overnight in a hotel. The next morning, \nApplicant was arrested by the police for assault after leaving his hotel room. Since it \nwas a holiday weekend, he was held in jail for three days before he could see a judge. \n(Tr. 52-54; GE 9; AE G) \n \nWhile sitting in jail, Applicant realized he had a company payroll cycle that \nneeded attention, but he did not have his business partner\u2019s telephone number \nmemorized. The only phone number he had memorized was his wife\u2019s phone number. \nApplicant claimed he did not realize that a protective order had been issued, so he \ncalled his wife from jail. They had a cordial conversation, and he asked her to call his \nbusiness partner to handle the company payroll. Applicant was then rearrested for \nviolation of a protection order. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) The protective order remained valid for a \nperiod of five months. Applicant had to move into his own apartment. Applicant \naccepted a deferred sentence agreement which required him to successfully complete \n24 weeks of an anger management program, and successfully complete two years of \nprobation without further violations. The violation of a protective order was nolle prossed \nin March 2016. Applicant successfully completed the anger management program in \nSeptember 2016, and the assault of a family member charge was dismissed in March \n2018. (Tr. 54-58; GE 9; AE G) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n\n \n9 \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable under the established facts \nin this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n10 \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official,\u2026 in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, and  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to: \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified SCAs and background interviews concerning his \nemployment and termination history with the Peace Corps and GSA. He intentionally \nfailed to fully disclose the circumstances of his workplace misconduct, and he provided \ncontradictory and inconsistent statements throughout multiple security clearance \ninvestigations. While serving as a government contracting officer in Iraq, Applicant was \naccused of setting up a sham company, bribery, and receiving monetary kickbacks for \nawarding contacts to companies involved in the scheme. He was arrested on more than \none occasion for assault on a family member, and he was arrested for violation of a \nprotection order. As recently as 2018, the court dismissed an assault charge against \nApplicant after his completion of anger management classes and two years of \nprobation. Applicant did not disclose his full criminal history on the SCAs, and he \nprovided contradictory statements about his May 2012 assault arrest during two \nbackground interviews. Applicant admitted to intentionally accessing pornography on a \ngovernment computer, but his previous accounts of how he accessed these websites, \nand whether he did so intentionally, were also inconsistent. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible. He has not made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct omissions or \nfalsifications provided during the course of several security clearance investigations. His \nclaim that either a judge\u2019s ruling, or a company settlement agreement, preventing him \nfrom disclosing his workplace misconduct pursuant to a \u201cgag order\u201d is self-serving and \nunconvincing. He demonstrates a pattern of dishonesty, which casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. Many of his statements and \nexplanations were uncorroborated. After reviewing his history of misconduct and deceit, \nI find that it is probable Applicant\u2019s inappropriate behavior is likely to recur. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n12 \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. This SOR highlights serious offenses that \nprovides insight to Applicant\u2019s character and integrity. Applicant is not remorseful for his \nmisconduct or deceit. His explanations are self-serving and insincere. I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated security concerns raised by his personal conduct. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n      Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 6, 2015. \nOn October 13, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons \n(SOR), \nalleging \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The DOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on November 30, 2017, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nFebruary 21, 2018, and the case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 22, \n2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \n04/10/2019\n\n2 \n \nhearing was scheduled for June 7, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which \nwas admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 12, 2018. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant appeared at the hearing with a personal representative. However, both \nApplicant and the personal representative were unfamiliar with the hearing process. It \nwas Applicant\u2019s intention for the personal representative to testify on Applicant\u2019s behalf. \nWe resolved this issue as follows: Both parties waived opening statements and the \npersonal representative testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf, and then acted as Applicant\u2019s \npersonal representative. \n \n \nAt the start of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR \nallegations, and further stated that he might make an additional motion at the end of the \nhearing. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion and Applicant was initially uncertain as \nto whether or not he was prepared to proceed with the hearing. I stated that I would leave \nthe record open for 30 days in order to permit Applicant to more fully respond to the \namended allegations and to submit additional documentation. Under these conditions, \nApplicant determined that he was prepared to proceed with the hearing. Department \nCounsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence, and I granted his motion \nwithout objection. The record remained open until July 9, 2018. Applicant timely submitted \nAX B through H, which included a statement addressing the SOR amendments. I admitted \nthe additional evidence without objection. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, 56, is a senior software systems engineer currently employed by a \ndefense contractor since April 2008. He was previously employed in the same position by \ndefense contractors since at least 2002. Applicant worked as a Federal employee from \n1988 until 1997. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1985. He and \nhis wife married in 1982 and have three adult children. He was granted his first security \nclearance in 1988. (GX 1.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR as amended alleges that Applicant failed to timely file \nhis state and federal tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2016. Applicant admits the \nSOR allegations. The delinquent tax filings are documented in Applicant\u2019s responses to \ninterrogatories, Answer, and documentary submissions. His admissions are incorporated \nin my findings of fact. \n \nApplicant does not have any formal training in tax preparation. He prepares and \nfiles his own tax returns using tax-preparation software, due in large measure to his \nconcern that accountants and tax preparers are likely targets of hacking. For many years, \nApplicant erroneously believed that if he was entitled to a refund from the IRS, he was \nnot required to file his tax return on the annual deadline, but was instead required to file \n\n3 \n \nwithin three years of the annual deadline or he would forfeit his refund. (GX 2; Tr. 37-38; \nAnswer.) Applicant also stated that his state of residence withholds refunds after two \nyears, so he historically tried to file his Federal and state taxes within two years of the \ndeadline. (Tr. 37-38.) \n \nApplicant attributes his late tax filings primarily to the complexity of his taxes, his \nmisconception about filing requirements, and his efforts to maintain balance in his family \nand work lives. (Answer.) The issues and events that Applicant identifies as having made \nhis tax accounting and preparation complex, and his filings and payments delinquent, are \ndiscussed more fully below. \n \nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s wife was in a serious car accident in which she was gravely \ninjured. She suffered from ongoing health issues for many years that required frequent \nmedical attention. Applicant incurred significant medical costs, and itemized these on his \ntax returns. (GX 2; Tr. 50.) Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s health deteriorated in 2012 and 2013, and \nshe underwent surgery in 2014 as a result of the injuries she received in the accident. \nThrough the years, Applicant prioritized his wife\u2019s medical care and concern over her \nhealth over preparing his tax returns. (Answer.) \n \nIn approximately 2008, Applicant started a two-pronged business venture. He \npurchased a used recreational vehicle (RV) with the intention of refurbishing it and \nreselling it. He also bought an online subscription service that was theoretically designed \nto permit Applicant to purchase deeply discounted vacation packages to resell. A \ncomponent of the vacation-sale business was to recruit other people to purchase and sell \nthe packages, and Applicant would receive a percentage of their sales. Applicant did not \ngenerate any reportable income from either part of the business, nor did he ever obtain a \nbusiness license. (GX 2; Answer.) However, the business did generate expenses that \nApplicant itemized on his tax returns. Applicant did not keep business records in real time \nand this complicated his ability to gather information in order to timely file his tax returns. \n(Tr. 53-58.) Applicant officially closed the business in June 2016. (Answer.) \n \nIn tax year 2011, Applicant\u2019s then-employer issued stock options to its employees, \nincluding Applicant. Because of the way the employer issued the stock options, the value \nof the options was imputed to the employees as income, which necessarily increased \ntheir tax obligations. The employer sent Applicant an IRS Schedule K-1 that was incorrect. \nApplicant contacted the employer, which in turn contacted the IRS to amend the Schedule \nK-1s. It took several years for this issue to be corrected, and Applicant did not file his tax \nreturns while the issue was pending. (GX 2.) It is unclear when the schedule K-1 was \namended. Applicant sold the stocks in April 2017 and received his last Schedule K-1 in \nMarch 2017. (Tr. 63-65.) \n \nIt took Applicant approximately 440 hours to do the accounting and tax preparation \nfor tax year 2014. Despite this large investment of time, Applicant miscalculated his tax \nobligation and owed approximately $90. He filed the 2014 Federal return in July 2017, \nand paid the amount due in September 2017. (GX 2; Tr. 45-46; Answer.) \n \n\n4 \n \nApplicant spoke extensively about his delinquent tax filings during his personal \nsubject interview (PSI) in May 2015. Applicant identified tax year 2011 as the year he \nbegan having difficulty in his tax accounting and preparation in both his e-QIP and his \nPSI. He stated because of his difficulties filing his 2011 tax returns, he was unable to \ntimely file 2012, 2013, and 2014. He filed his 2011 Federal return on April 21, 2015. He \nanticipated filing his 2013 and 2014 tax returns soon. Additionally, the IRS sent inquiries \nto Applicant for non-filing of tax returns in at least 2012, 2013, and 2016. (GX 2; Answer.) \n \nApplicant signed his responses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories on October 4, 2017. The \ninterrogatories required Applicant to submit IRS account transcripts for tax years 2011 \nthrough 2016. Applicant stated that his 2016 state and Federal tax returns remained \nunfiled. However, his 2015 state and Federal returns were also unfiled. He filed his 2015 \nFederal return on October 10, 2017. Applicant filed for an extension for his 2016 Federal \nreturn. However, he missed the October 15, 2017, deadline and filed the return on \nNovember 24, 2017. (GX 2; Tr. 43-45; Answer.). \n \nThe instructions section of IRS Form 1040, updated annually, specifically sets forth \nthe filing requirements for that tax year. For example, in 2011 married couples filing jointly \nwith both spouses under the age of 65 with a gross income of at least $20,600 were \nrequired to file a Federal return by April 18, 2016.1 Applicant\u2019s income has exceeded the \nannual minimum gross income for tax years 2011 through 2016.2 (Answer.) Applicant was \ngenerally entitled to receive refunds from the IRS. However, he forfeited his 2011 refund \nby filing the return more than three years after the filing deadline on April 21, 2015. \nApplicant filed automatic extensions for several tax years, but did not meet the October \n15 deadlines. (GX 2; Tr. 40-43; Answer.)  \n \nApplicant filed an extension for his 2017 Federal tax return, which moved his \ndeadline to October 15, 2018. However, Applicant\u2019s accounting and tax preparation \nresulted in Applicant\u2019s owing Federal tax for 2017. He was required by Federal law to \nsubmit his payment by the April 2018 filing deadline. On May 31, 2018, Applicant filed the \nreturn with a check for $2,500 for tax payment. (AX A.) Further, this submission occurred \none week after Applicant acknowledged receipt of the Notice of Hearing.3 Regarding his \n2017 return, Applicant stated: \n \nIt is interesting that my 2017 \"Application for Automatic Extension of Time \nto File\" projects us receiving a $300 refund while my actual tax filing shows \nus owing additional taxes. In other words, we made yet another mistake. It \nis a humbling lesson learned for me going forward that estimates (just like \n2014) can be wrong. (AX B.) \n \n                                            \n1 The relevant pages from 2011 1040 instructions from www.irs.gov are appended to the record as Administrative \nExhibit (AD EX) IV. \n \n2 See www.irs.gov. \n \n3 The email acknowledging receipt of the Notice of Hearing is appended to the file as AD EX II. Appellant\u2019s sheet of \ncorrections of the transcript is amended to the file as AD EX III. \n\n5 \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant realized he was required to file by the IRS deadlines \nregardless of whether or not he was entitled to a refund, but it was at some point prior to \nfiling his Answer on November 30, 2017. However, Applicant also stated in his Answer \nthat his \u201cprevious security investigations revealed this same issue since [his] wife\u2019s wreck \nin 2001 and since the start of [his] business in 2008.\u201d Upon receiving the SOR, he realized \nthat his practice of delinquently filing his tax returns could have a negative impact on his \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 67-70.)  \n \nApplicant does not owe any balance for his 2014 state tax. However, as of \nSeptember 28, 2017, Applicant had not filed his 2015 and 2016 state tax returns. \n(Answer.) Applicant filed his 2017 state tax return on May 31, 2018. (AX A.) \n \nApplicant thinks filing his tax returns will be simplified now that he no longer has to \nwait for a Schedule K-1 or incorporate the information from it into his tax calculations, but \ninstead receives a standard employee W-2. (Tr. 66.) Applicant stated that because he \nwas operating under the misconception that he had three years to file if he was owed a \nrefund from the IRS, he did not think he was violating any laws. (Tr. 70.) Applicant stated \nseveral times that he remains circumspect about hiring a tax preparer or accountant out \nof concern that Applicant\u2019s personal information will be hacked. His current intention is to \ncontinue preparing his own tax returns. (Tr. 64-73.) Applicant does not have any \ndelinquent accounts or other financial issues. (AX C-AX H.) Now that Applicant is aware \nof the negative impact his delinquent filing of his Federal and state tax returns could have \non his security eligibility, he intends to timely file all future tax returns. (Tr. 70-71.) \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s witness, a security specialist who has worked with Applicant for more \nthan 11 years, holds a security clearance. She is aware of the SOR allegations. She \ntestified that Applicant is trustworthy and reliable, stating that he has identified and helped \nto rectify several data spillages that were potentially damaging, and that he has never \ncaused a security-related incident. (Tr. 28-31.) Applicant provided character references \nfrom his supervisor since 2003, a friend of over 30 years, a coworker since 2008, and a \nformer coworker and friend of 28 years. Each is aware of the SOR allegations. \nCollectively, they stated that Applicant is a person of integrity who is skilled in his \nprofession. Given Applicant\u2019s character and trustworthiness, they highly recommend \nApplicant for continued access to classified information. (Answer.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \n\n6 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying condition: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant did not timely file his Federal and state tax returns for 2011 through 2016, \ndespite receiving extensions for many years. He did not timely pay his 2014 and 2017 tax \nobligations. The 2011 inaccurate tax reporting by Applicant\u2019s employer and Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s medical expenses were conditions that were beyond Applicant\u2019s control. These \n\n8 \n \nconditions added complexity to Applicant\u2019s accounting and tax preparation, which \ncontributed to his inability to timely file his tax returns. It is understandable that Applicant \nwanted to maintain balance with his personal and professional lives and to prioritize his \nwife\u2019s care. Further, it is not unreasonable for Applicant to be concerned that his personal \ninformation could be at risk through hacking. Nevertheless, Applicant did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. There are a myriad of options that Applicant could \nhave employed to protect his personal information when using the services of a tax \nprofessional. For example, Applicant could ensure that the tax professional computed \nApplicant\u2019s taxes without entering his personal information. The computed tax information \ncould then be entered by Applicant and submitted to the taxing authority. \n \n \nApplicant also attributes his pattern of failing to timely file his tax returns to his \nmisconception about his filing requirements. Applicant is college educated and has \nworked as a software systems engineer since at least 2002. The 1040 instructions clearly \nset forth the filing requirements and these requirements have applied to Applicant for all \ntax years in question. It is unclear exactly when Applicant fully understood that he is \nrequired to file his Federal tax return annually by the IRS deadlines established by the \nIRS. \n  \n \nFurther, Applicant has been given notice that the government is concerned about \ntimely filing of taxes by the questions asked on his 2015 e-QIP, and likely during his \nprevious background investigations. Applicant was also questioned extensively about his \nfailure to timely file his taxes during his May 2015 PSI. Applicant had to have understood \nthe security concern raised by his pattern of delinquently filing his tax returns when he \nreceived DOHA\u2019s interrogatories in September 2017. The fact that Applicant filed his 2015 \ntax return the day after he completed his responses to interrogatories underscores the \nfact that Applicant understood that his failure to timely file his tax returns had security \nclearance implications.  \n \n \nHowever, despite having received the SOR in October 2017, Applicant did not file \nhis 2016 Federal tax return until November 24, 2017, well after the extension deadline. \nHe did not timely pay his 2018 Federal tax obligation. Applicant filed his 2017 return, the \nfirst return filed within an extension period, and paid his tax obligation only after receiving \nthe hearing notice. Applicant asserted that he will timely file his future tax returns now that \nhe is aware of the security clearance implications. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s overarching motivation for his last-minute efforts to comply with his tax-\nfiling obligations, as well as his future promise of compliance, is protecting his security \nclearance. The appeal board has regularly held that \u201capplicants who only begin to address \ntheir security-significant conduct when their personal interests are at stake may be lacking \nin judgment and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, \n2017.)  \n \n \nIn specifically addressing mitigating condition 20(g) in ISCR Case No. 17-01807 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018), the appeal board observed: \n \n\n9 \n \nThe mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a payment \nagreement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to \nissue a favorable decision. As with the application of any mitigating \ncondition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide whether \nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. \nThe timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the judge to \nconsider in the application of [this mitigating condition]. pp 3-4. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of failing to timely file his Federal and state tax returns is recent \nand raises concerns about his willingness to abide by rules and regulations, and his \ncurrent reliability and judgment. While many factors contributed to Applicant\u2019s failure to \ntimely file his Federal and state tax returns for many years, he did not act reasonably \nunder those circumstances. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2 were addressed under that guideline, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1988. His supervisor, coworkers, and \nfriends highly recommend Applicant for a continued security clearance. He is a skilled \nprofessional. However, through his failure to timely file and pay his taxes, Applicant has \nnot demonstrated the judgment and reliability required of individuals granted access to \nclassified information. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his failure to timely file his tax returns taxes \nas required. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him continued eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Sykstus, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his 2012 arrest for felony \naggravated child abuse. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on May 21, 2013. On \nDecember 23, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline J. The DOD acted under Executive \nOrder (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.  \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 22, 2017, and the case \nwas assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 21, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for June 6, 2018. \n03/14/2019\n\n2 \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AX) A through Q, which were admitted without objection, and called four witnesses. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2018. \n \nThe SOR was issued under the AG implemented on September 1, 2006. The DOD \nimplemented the amended AG on June 8, 2017, while this decision was pending. This \ndecision will be decided based on the amended AG effective June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old engineering manager currently employed by a defense \ncontractor since October 2015, and employed in the defense industry since 1993. He has \nheld a clearance since 1996. He earned a bachelor of science degree in mathematics in \n1993. He and his current wife married in 2004. They have a blended family with three \nchildren ages 19, 18, and 11. (GX 1.)  \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline J that Applicant was arrested in October 2012 \nand charged with felony aggravated child abuse. The arrest was based on accusations \nmade by Applicant\u2019s oldest son and Applicant\u2019s ex-wife. Applicant admits that he was \narrested, but denies that he committed any criminal act. \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife married in 1996 and divorced in November 2004. At the \ntime of the divorce, Applicant and his ex-wife had a 5-year-old son. Following the divorce, \nApplicant and his ex-wife have repeatedly returned to court over issues of custody and \nchild support. Their relationship is contentious, at best. (AX A - AX E.) \n \nIn October 2012, Applicant and his ex-wife had joint custody of their 12-year-old \nson. At the request of his ex-wife, Applicant went to her house to discipline their son. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife met Applicant in the driveway and showed him marks on her wrists \nwhere their son had grabbed her while she was trying to punish him for failing math. \nApplicant entered the house and confronted his son. Applicant, in the presence of his ex-\nwife, removed his belt and hit his son three times with it for being disrespectful to his \nmother. Applicant further told his son that he would not be permitted to participate in any \nextracurricular activities until his math grade improved. (Tr. 28-31.) \n \nThe following week, Applicant had custody of his son. Applicant learned from a \nfriend of his daughter\u2019s that Applicant\u2019s son had posted, \u201cI hate my f-ing dad\u2019s guts\u201d on a \nsocial media account. Applicant was distressed by the post, but was also distressed \nbecause he did not allow his children to have social media accounts. (Tr. 32-33.) \n \nApplicant logged in to the site and pulled up his son\u2019s post. Applicant showed the \npost to his son and demanded that his son read the post aloud. His son was clearly afraid, \nand refused to read the post. Applicant \u201cpopped\u201d his son in the back of the head and \nagain demanded that his son read the post aloud. His son refused. Applicant grabbed his \nson by the front of the shirt and catching his son\u2019s leather necklace, a scuffle ensued, and \n\n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s son ended up on the kitchen floor, screaming and crying. Applicant told his \nson to calm down and go to bed. (Tr. 32-36.) \n \nThe next morning, Applicant\u2019s son wore a shirt buttoned to the neck to school. In \nthe early afternoon, Applicant got a telephone call informing him that he needed to go to \nthe county\u2019s child advocacy center for some issues with his son. When Applicant arrived, \nhis ex-wife\u2019s car was already there. Applicant was met by county officers who wanted to \ndiscuss aggravated child abuse charges with Applicant. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife had told the \nofficers about the incident the night before, as well as the spanking incident the previous \nweek, which combined, rose to the level of felony aggravated child abuse. (Tr. 36-40.) \n \nApplicant was shown photographs of his son\u2019s neck which had multiple red marks \non it. Applicant did not see any marks on his son\u2019s neck following the scuffle or the next \nmorning because of his son\u2019s fully buttoned shirt, but believes they were possibly caused \nin part by the leather necklace, but were primarily self-inflicted by his son. (Tr. 90-91; GX \n2; Tr. 61-63.) \n \nApplicant was indicted by a grand jury, arrested, and charged with felony \naggravated child abuse. (GX 4.) He properly reported the arrest to his facility security \nofficer who instructed Applicant to keep the security office informed. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife \nimmediately filed for child support and sole custody of their son. Following the indictment, \nthe contract on which Applicant was working went to another contractor and Applicant \nwas laid off. Despite submitting hundreds of job applications, Applicant was unemployed \nfor approximately 11 months. (Tr. 38-41.)   \n \nAfter approximately two years, in September 2014, on the advice of his attorney, \nApplicant pled guilty to third-degree assault, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to one \nyear in prison, which was suspended for two years; two years\u2019 supervised probation; a \n$500 fine; $250 restitution; and 40 hours community service. Applicant was also required \nto complete: a domestic violence program; a parenting program; an anger management \nprogram; and undergo an assessment for drug or alcohol abuse. A protective order in \nApplicant\u2019s son\u2019s favor was entered against Applicant which required him to have no \ncontact with his son. (GX 4.) Applicant completed restitution in March 2016, all other court \nrequirements between 2013 and 2015, and was released from probation without violation \nin October 2015. (AX F - AX J.) Applicant has not had any contact with his son since \n2012. (Tr. 40-41.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, who was present during the incident with Applicant\u2019s son, \nrecounted the events in accord with Applicant. The following day, she met Applicant at \nthe child advocacy center, and was interviewed and gave a written statement to the police \nwherein she emphatically stated that Applicant had not abused his son. Applicant\u2019s wife \nwas shown pictures of the marks on Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s neck, and was shocked. She \ntestified that there were no markings or injuries on Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s neck when he went \nto bed after the incident. (Tr. 77-85.) She further testified to the strength of character of \nApplicant, and stated that Applicant is a devoted father to all of their children and would \nnever abuse any of them. (Tr. 75-76.)  \n\n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother testified that Applicant has never been an overly strict \ndisciplinarian, and has been a very involved father for all of his children. (Tr. 100-102.) \nApplicant\u2019s friend, who is also a pastor, stated that Applicant discussed the situation with \nhis son with him, and that Applicant was deeply affected by the situation. (Tr. 107.) \nApplicant\u2019s friend of over 13 years, who is a public school nurse and was previously an \nemergency room nurse, has witnessed victims of child abuse. She has observed \nApplicant and his wife around all of their children and has never witnessed any type or \npattern of abuse in their household. (Tr. 112 \u2013 113.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was credible and remorseful. The summary of Applicant\u2019s \npersonal subject interview (PSI) and his Answer are consistent with his testimony and his \nwife\u2019s testimony. Applicant has never been accused of any other abuse. Applicant wrote \na letter to his son at the time of the incident stating \u201cI\u2019m here for you.\u201d He has maintained \nthe same cell phone numbers and hopes and prays that someday his son will contact \nhim. (Tr. 66.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \n\n5 \n \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe concern under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe following disqualifying condition applies under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or \nconvicted. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n\n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant was indicted for felony aggravated child abuse. He later pled guilty to \nthird-degree assault, a misdemeanor. He has not had any contact with his son since 2012. \nHe completed all court-ordered requirements and was released from probation without \nviolation in 2015. Applicant admits that he spanked him on one occasion and that he \nsmacked the back of his son\u2019s head and grabbed him up out of the chair by the front of \nhis shirt on another occasion. There is no history of reported abuse prior to these two \nincidents that occurred in 2012, nor are there any more recent allegations of any type of \nabuse of Applicant\u2019s other two children. These two incidents with Applicant\u2019s son occurred \nmore than six years ago under circumstances that are not likely to recur. The incidents \ndo not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nSince 2012, Applicant paid restitution, successfully completed all requirements of \nprobation, has regained employment with a defense contractor, and continues to be a \nyouth-sports coach in his community. He regrets the loss of his relationship with his son \nand hopes he will contact him in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1996. He properly reported his arrest \nto his employer. Applicant is remorseful for his past conduct. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline J, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his arrest. Accordingly, I conclude he has \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

The record in this case closed 25\nMarch 2017, when Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due. Applicant provided no\nadditional documents. DOHA assigned the case to me 1 October 2017.\nConsisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-8 .\n1\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. On 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed Security\nExecutive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8 June 2017. \n1\n   12/11/2018\n\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old configuration manager employed by a U.S. defense\ncontractor since October 2013. She has served previously in similar positions with a\nseries of defense contractors since May 1992. She has had small gaps in employment\nas her currently employer lost its bid on the renewal contract, only to have herself be\nhired by the successor contractor. The longest such gap was from December 2005 to\nJune 2006. She seeks to retain the clearance she was issued in July 2007 (Item 5, 6).\nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (Items 6-8) establish,12 delinquent\ndebts totaling nearly $12,000, and a May 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition which was\ndischarged in June 2005. Applicant admitted some debts, and the bankruptcy; claimed\nthat some debts had been included in her bankruptcy; and claimed to have been\nunaware of some other debts. She listed no delinquent debts on her December 2014\nclearance application (Item 5), but was confronted with them during an April 2015\ninterview with a Government investigator (Item 6) based on a January 2015 credit report\n(Item 7). She similarly failed to disclose a handful of criminal arrests/citations (SOR 2.a-\n2.f), but was confronted with them during her interview.3\nApplicant documented no efforts to address her debts, either after her interview or\nafter she received the SOR. She attributed her 2005 bankruptcy filing to her August 1997\ndivorce, but it is difficult to see this as anything but attenuated. She provided no budget\nor financial statement. She has not documented any financial or credit counseling. She\nprovided no work or character references, or any evidence of community involvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the\nrelevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant claimed that she thought the felony question (SOR 2.f) referred to the last seven years, and in any\n3\nevent, she had discussed the offense during her 2007 background investigation. She provided no\ncorroboration for this latter claim, but given the age of the offense (nearly 25 years at the time of her clearance\napplication) I find the allegation to hold little security significance. Regarding her omissions of her more-recent\ncriminal history and financial problems, she variously claimed to have forgotten them or to have listed them\non her clearance application. These explanations are less credible.\n2\n\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of\nfinancial difficulties for which she did not provide any documentation of efforts to resolve\nher debts.5\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. \nShe has not clearly documented any efforts to resolve them.  Applicant did not document\n6\nthat her financial problems were due to circumstances beyond her control, and she\ndocumented no efforts to resolve them, either after her subject interview or after she\nreceived the SOR or FORM.  Applicant has had no credit or financial counseling, and\n7\nthere is no evidence any of the debts are being resolved.  Her lack of effort does not\n8\nconstitute a good-faith effort to address her debts.  In addition, Applicant has not\n9\ndemonstrated a track record of living within her means. Furthermore, Applicant provided\nno \u201cwhole-person\u201d evidence to mitigate the security concerns raised by her inaction on\nthe debts. Accordingly, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n19(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history\n5\nof not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n8\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n9\n3\n\n \nIn similar fashion, the Government established cases for disqualification under\nGuidelines J and E. At a minimum, the circumstances of her criminal conduct and her\nclearance application omissions bespeak an inattentiveness to detail which is\ninconsistent with access to classified information. Her response to the SOR is largely a\nplea to save her job, but without a more thorough explanation of her criminal conduct\nand the clearance application omissions, she cannot mitigate the security concerns\nraised by these allegations. Accordingly, I conclude Guidelines J and E against\nApplicant.\n Formal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-m:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3. Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-b, d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Clearance denied.\n                                              \n                                             \nJOHN GRATTAN METZ, JR\nAdministrative Judge\n4\n",

Edmunds, Esq. \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated foreign influence and foreign preference security concerns \nrelating to his connections to Iraq. His father and sister live in Kurdistan, a region of \nIraq. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nHistory of the Case \nOn February 12, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On September 22, 2016, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.   \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n01/08/2019\n\n \n2                                                                                                                                             \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the foreign influence and \nforeign preference guidelines.  \n \nOn October 30, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 3) On March 22, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed. On May 2, 2018, the case was assigned to another administrative judge. On \nAugust 14, 2018, the case was transferred to me. On November 8, 2018, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing \nfor December 13, 2018. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits; Applicant \nprovided eight exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 13-17, 33-36; Government Exhibits (GE) 1-3; \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A-I) On January 2, 2019, I received the transcript of the hearing.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence and foreign preference security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to Iraq. Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice of facts \nconcerning Iraq, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 9) Department \nCounsel and Applicant indicated they had no objection to me taking administrative \nnotice of facts from the U.S. Department of State website concerning Iraq.1 (Tr. 9-10) \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. \nBd.

Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). \nUsually administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either \nwell known or from government reports.

(Tr. 10; HE \n3) He also provided mitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old linguist, and DOD contractors have employed him \nsince April 2015 in Iraq. (Tr. 23) Shortly after his hearing, he returned to Iraq to continue \nhis linguist duties. (Tr. 26) His annual salary as a linguist is $80,000.

(AE A) In \n1989, he married, and his children are ages 24, 27, and 28. (Tr. 18-20) His spouse is 56 \nyears old. (Tr. 22) His children are citizens and residents of the United States. (Tr. 19-\n21) His father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of the United States, \nand in 2006, they arranged for Applicant, his spouse, and their children\u2019s immigration to \nthe United States from Iraq. (Tr. 21-22, 53) In 2012, Applicant and his spouse were \nnaturalized as U.S. citizens. (Tr. 52) He has property in the United States including a \nhome and about $22,000 in his U.S. bank account. (Tr. 24; AE F) \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has three relatives living in Iraq. His father and \none sister are citizens and residents of Kurdistan, a region of Iraq. (Tr. 26; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b; GE 1) His father and sister live together. (Tr. 27) His father is 84 years old and \nsuffers from cancer and high blood pressure. (Tr. 38) His mother is deceased. (Tr. 40) \nHis most recent visit with his father was in 2012, and he most recently communicated \nwith his father or sister two or three years ago. (Tr. 27-28) He does not send money to \nhis father or sister in Iraq. (Tr. 28) He does not own property or bank accounts in Iraq. \n(Tr. 28-29) When his father dies, he does not plan to go to Iraq for his father\u2019s funeral, \nand his father\u2019s property in Iraq will go to his sister in Iraq. (Tr. 39-41) His only visits to \nIraq after 2012 were on behalf of his employer. (Tr. 41) \n \nApplicant has a sister who lived in Iraq and is a citizen of Iraq. She currently \nresides in Germany with her husband. (Tr. 29; SOR \u00b6 1.c) He communicates with his \nsister in Germany, who provides information to Applicant about his family in Iraq. (Tr. \n39) \n \n                                            \n2 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant\u2019s and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information. \n \n3 In accordance with \u201cwell established DoD policy [Applicant and his family\u2019s] religious affiliation \nplay[ed] no part\u201d in this decision.

May 25, 2012). \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \nForeign Preference \n \nApplicant is not fluent in English. He admitted twice that he voted in an Iraqi \nelection in 2014. (Tr. 30; SOR response; Officer of Personnel Management (OPM) \npersonal subject interview (PSI); GE 2) In his OPM PSI, which is the investigator\u2019s \nsummary of his statement, he said he voted because he wanted to help Iraq become a \nbetter democratic country like the United States. (Tr. 44; GE 2) He may have simply \nagreed with the OPM investigator\u2019s statements about voting. Applicant explained in \nbroken English, \u201cIt\u2019s not a vote. There was misunderstood for me in that question, \nbecause they, did you practice or did you exercise this election. I said yes. Yeah I work \non it. I\u2019m not vote in it.\u201d (Tr. 31) He said he did not understand English \u201cvery good,\u201d and \u201cI \nwork there. It\u2019s not vote.\u201d (Tr. 44) \u201cI see a lot of Iraqis they come to vote. That one they \nvote in Iraq and they vote. For that I say it\u2019s allowed to Iraqis to vote who\u2019s living in the \nU.S. . . . So for that I say they allowed to me. But I\u2019m not voted on.\u201d (Tr. 45-46) He was \nunable to clarify the content of the summary in his OPM PSI, possibly because he could \nnot understand the questions about it; however, he insisted that he did not vote in the \nIraqi election. (Tr. 49) \n \nIn 2010 and 2014, Applicant worked as a volunteer while living in the United \nStates to help expatriate Iraqis living in the United States vote in Iraqi elections. (Tr. 31-\n32, 47) He was paid in 2014; however, he was unsure if he was paid in 2010 for this \nwork. (Tr. 31-32; 42-43) He did not say whether or not the Iraqi or U.S. government or \nsome other entity paid him in 2014. \n \nApplicant did not believe he continued to have Iraqi citizenship, and in any event, \nhe was willing to renounce his Iraqi citizenship. (Tr. 50)4 In 2012, he took the \nNaturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America (AE H) which states: \n \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and \nabjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will \nbear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf \nof the United States when required by the law; that I will perform \nnoncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when \nrequired by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under \ncivilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation \nfreely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me \nGod.5 \n                                            \n4 The Iraqi Council of the Presidency issued Article 10(I), which states, \u201cAn Iraqi who acquires a \nforeign nationality shall retain his Iraqi nationality, unless he has declared in writing renunciation of his \nIraqi nationality.\u201d Iraqi Official Gazette Issue 4019 dated March 7, 2006, No. 26, https://www.refworld.org/ \npdfid/4b1e364c2.pdf.  \n \n5 The language of the current Oath of Allegiance is found in the Code of Federal Regulations \nSection 337.1 and is closely based upon the statutory elements in Section 337(a) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act.

(Tr. 25) He goes on \npatrols outside his base with soldiers, and he wears a helmet and vest outside his base. \n(Tr. 25; AE I) He is not permitted to carry a weapon. (Tr. 26) He does not visit his family \nin Iraq. (Tr. 26) He is not authorized to leave the Army base or to have visitors at the \nArmy base. (Tr. 26) He provided photographs of Army personnel he served with in Iraq. \n(Tr. 32-36; AE I) He was present in camp when an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL) \nvehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED) exploded and caused damage to his \ncamp. (Tr. 36-37; AE I) ISIL or some other terrorists fired at his patrol three times when \nhe was in Iraq; however, he was not injured. (Tr. 51) \n \nOn April 19, 2018, an Army colonel and Task Force commander, who served \nwith Applicant in Iraq from August 2017 to April 2018, wrote: \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] dedication, professionalism and positive demeanor positively \nimpacted the Task Force\u2019s ability to communicate, coordinate and execute \noperations in close partnership with Iraqi senior leaders. [Applicant] could \nalways be counted upon to assist with requirements, going above and \nbeyond to accomplish the mission. His superb knowledge of the language \nand culture directly impacted the unit\u2019s ability to achieve mission success \nand he was an indispensable member of the team. \n \n(AE B).

(AE C) They described his diligent, \nprofessional, and honorable service as a linguist. (AE C) \n \nIraq \n \nThe U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership with \nIraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq marked \na milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, stable, and \nself-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the United States in the region as well \nas a voice of moderation and democracy in the Middle East. Iraq has functioning \ngovernment institutions including an active legislature, is playing an increasingly \nconstructive role in the region, and has a bright economic future as oil revenues surpass \npre-Saddam production levels with continued rapid growth to come. The United States \nmaintains vigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, \nand security issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement. \n \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nThe Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) between Iraq and the United States \nprovides the basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship. It covers the range of bilateral \nissues including political relations and diplomacy, defense and security, trade and \nfinance, energy, judicial and law enforcement issues, services, science, culture, \neducation, and environment. Efforts to implement the SFA are overseen by the Higher \nCoordinating Committee and several Joint Coordination Committees, which meet \nperiodically. \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping, and advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq. The current \ntravel advisory level is Level 4: Do not travel.  \n \nThe ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens \noutside Baghdad is limited given the security environment. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and \nattacks by IEDs occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Methods of \nattack have included explosively formed penetrators (EFPs), magnetic IEDs placed on \nvehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed on or concealed near roads, \nmortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire weapons. Such attacks may \ntake place in public venues such as cafes and markets.  \n \nIraq witnessed continued terrorist activity in 2016, primarily as a result of the \nactions of ISIL. In 2016, ISIL remained the greatest terrorist threat globally, maintaining a \nformidable force in Syria, including a large number of foreign terrorist fighters. ISIL\u2019s \ncapacity and territorial control in Iraq has dramatically eroded in the past two years. \nAccording to estimates from the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq, acts of terrorism and \nviolence killed more than 7,000 civilians and injured more than 12,000 in 2016. By the \nend of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory from ISIL, drastically \nreducing ISIL\u2019s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. Human rights violations continue \nto be a problem with allegations of unlawful killings and other abuses being made \nagainst the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces.  \n \nIn its annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported that \nsevere human rights problems were widespread. Sectarian hostility, widespread \ncorruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society weakened \nthe government's authority and worsened effective human rights protections. Iraqi \nSecurity Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed some \nhuman rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization Forces \nkilling, torturing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. ISIL committed the overwhelming \nmajority of serious human rights abuses, including attacks against: civilians, (particularly \nShia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL); members of other religious and ethnic \nminorities; women; and children. \n \nObservers also reported other significant human rights-related problems: harsh \nand life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; arbitrary arrest and \nlengthy pretrial detention, denial of fair public trial; insufficient judicial institutional \ncapacity; ineffective implementation of civil judicial procedures and remedies; arbitrary \ninterference with privacy and homes; child soldiers; limits on freedom of expression, \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nincluding press freedoms; violence against and harassment of journalists; undue \ncensorship; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \nlimits on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom due \nto violence by extremist groups; restrictions on freedom of movement; refugee and \ninternally displaced persons (IDP) abuse; both forced IDP returns and preventing IDPs \nfrom returning home; discrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, \nreligious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; trafficking \nin persons; societal discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due process; and \nlimitations on worker rights. \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Iraq is balanced against the \ninherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents and the Iraqi \ngovernment\u2019s problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top national \nsecurity goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and \nsupport of the Iraqi Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant admitted that his father and sister are citizens and residents of \nKurdistan, a region of Iraq. One of his sisters is a citizen of Iraq residing in Germany.   \n \nApplicant does not have frequent or recent direct contact with his family living in \nIraq. Applicant, his spouse, and three children were born in Kurdistan, a region of Iraq. \nApplicant maintains his relationships with his father and sister in Iraq through his sister \nliving in Germany. He did not establish an absence of care and concern for relatives \nliving in Iraq.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Iraq primarily \nbecause of terrorists and insurgents. Applicant has voluntarily shared in those dangers \non behalf of the DOD, and he is willing to do so in the future. Numerous linguists, \nsupporting U.S. forces, have family living in Iraq. Hundreds of United States and \ncoalition armed forces and civilian contractors serving in Iraq are targets of terrorists, \nalong with Iraqi civilians and soldiers who support the Iraqi government and cooperate \nwith coalition forces.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Iraq is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or her \nspouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another significant consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Iraq with the United States, and the situation in that country places a \nsignificant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship with \nany family member living in or visiting that country does not pose a trustworthiness or \nsecurity risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in or \nvisiting Iraq.6  \n \nGuideline B security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMay 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \n                                            \n6 The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 n. 18 (App. \nBd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security significance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family members in \na foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on their prominence or personal \nsituation. Rather, the issue is whether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an \napplicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance [or public trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Iraq seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Iraq has a significant problem with \nterrorism. Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes \nto the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would \nattempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, \n2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Iraq or visiting that \ncountry create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on \nhis family in Iraq in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. \nThese relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced substantial \nevidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with family in Iraq and has raised the issue of \npotential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply, \nand further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) and 8(c) apply. Applicant has \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has resided in the United States since 2006, except \nwhen he was in Iraq.7 Applicant, his spouse, and his three children are citizens and \nresidents of the United States. He and his spouse swore an oath of allegiance to the \nUnited States as part of the citizenship process. He has property in the United States \nincluding a home and a substantial bank account. Most importantly, he served as a \nlinguist in Iraq supporting U.S. goals in that country.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Iraq as a linguist and cultural advisor, including \nthe dangers that service entailed, weigh towards mitigating security concerns. Applicant \nseeks a security clearance to enable him to continue serving in Iraq, providing critical \nassistance to U.S. Armed Forces in a dangerous combat environment. He has offered \nto continue to risk his life to support the United States\u2019 goals in Iraq. He has shown his \n                                            \n7 ISCR Case No. 17-00629 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018) the Appeal Board discussed a translator\u2019s \nmultiple tours on behalf of the United States in Iraq, limited time as a resident in the United States, and \nconnections to family living in Iraq. The Appeal Board stated: \n     \nIn general, an applicant\u2019s deployment to a combat zone in support of U.S. forces is not a \nfactor that weighs against his or her national security eligibility. On the contrary, such \ndeployments tend to establish various mitigating conditions such as [Directive] \u00b6 8(b) \n(\u201cthere is no conflict of interest . . . because . . . the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d); [Directive] \u00b6 8(d) (\u201cthe foreign . . . \nactivities are on U.S. Government business\u201d); and [Directive] \u00b6 8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine \nnature of the foreign business . . . is such that [it is] unlikely to result in a conflict of \ninterest and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.\u201d) \n \nId. at 3 (internal footnotes omitted) (remanding administrative judge\u2019s denial of security clearance). \n\n \n13                                                                                                                                           \npatriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his support to DOD while \nserving in Iraq.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of \ndangerous high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant \ncontribution to national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

He does not have direct contact with \nhis family in Iraq. His travel to Iraq after 2012 was on behalf of the U.S. Government \nand not for personal reasons. He does not have property in Iraq. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Iraq. His father and sister reside in Kurdistan, a region of Iraq. Like \nevery other resident of Iraq, they are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights \nviolations of the Iraqi government. \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in Iraq, and Applicant has supported U.S. goals and objectives in \nIraq. Applicant and his family living in Iraq are potential targets of terrorists, and \nApplicant\u2019s potential access to classified information could theoretically add risk to his \nrelatives living in that country from lawless elements in Iraq.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Iraq continue but are \nattenuated as they are through his sister living in Germany. His connections to the \nUnited States taken together, including his support of U.S. goals in a combat \nenvironment, are sufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns under \nGuideline B.  \n \nForeign Preference \n \nAG \u00b6 9 articulates the security concern for foreign preference: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \n\n \n14                                                                                                                                           \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 lists six foreign preference conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case including: \n \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \n \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued by \nany country other than the United States; \n \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military organization; \nand \n \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in any way that conflicts with U.S. national \nsecurity interests; \n \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country in violation of U.S. law; and \n \n(f) an act of expatriation from the United States such as declaration of \nintent to renounce U.S. citizenship, whether through words or actions.  \n \n \nIn July 2012, Applicant was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. He erroneously stated \nthat he voted in an Iraqi election in 2014.8 Applicant credibly stated that he did not vote \nin the Iraqi election. His statement to the OPM investigator and his response to the SOR \nabout voting in the Iraqi election were caused by Applicant\u2019s misunderstanding of and \n                                            \n8 When the SOR was written, the previous version of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (Aug. 30, \n2006) was in effect, and AG \u00b6 10(a)(7) stated, \u201c(7) voting in a foreign election\u201d was a disqualifying \ncondition. The Department of Defense eliminated that disqualifying condition and did not replace it with a \nsimilar specific disqualifying security concern relating to voting. Currently, voting in a foreign election does \nnot, in and of itself, raise a security concern. See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., \n547 U.S. 47, 57-58 (2006) (\u201cWe refuse to interpret the Solomon Amendment in a way that negates its \nrecent revision, and indeed would render it a largely meaningless exercise.\u201d); Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, \n397 (1995). Voting in an Iraqi election by itself does not necessarily \u201cconflict[] with U.S. national security \ninterests.\u201d \n\n \n15                                                                                                                                           \nconfusion about the English language. He did not intend to mislead security officials \nabout his connections and preferences concerning Iraq.    \n \nIn April 2014, Applicant assisted Iraqis citizens living in the United States for \nabout three days who were interested in voting in an Iraqi election. It is unclear what \nentity funded this employment. It might have been funded by the Iraqi Government. \nApplicant\u2019s involvement in the Iraqi election while living in the United States shows \nenough of a preference or interest in Iraqi politics to raise a foreign preference security \nconcern. See AG \u00b6 10(d). \n \nOne foreign preference mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 11 applies in this case, \n\u201c(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign citizenship that is \nin conflict with U.S. national security interests.\u201d Applicant stated that he is willing to or \nhas renounced his Iraqi citizenship. Foreign preference security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and C are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old linguist, and DOD contractors have employed him \nsince April 2015 in Iraq. Shortly after his hearing, he returned to Iraq to continue his \nlinguist duties. His annual salary as a linguist is $80,000. In 2006, he and his family \nmoved to the United States. In 2012, he and his spouse became U.S. citizens, and they \ntook the oath of allegiance to the United States. His employment and assets are located \nin the United States.  \n \n\n \n16                                                                                                                                           \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iraq must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers there.9 Iraq is a dangerous place because of violence \nfrom terrorists, and the Iraqi government does not respect the full spectrum of human \nrights. Terrorists continue to threaten the Iraqi government, the interests of the United \nStates, U.S. Armed Forces, and those who cooperate and assist the United States. The \nUnited States and Iraqi governments are allies in the war on terrorism. \n \nApplicant has indirect contact through his sister in Germany with his father and \nsister in Iraq. Contacts with family in foreign countries are a manifestation of one\u2019s care \nand concern for relatives living in those foreign countries. His relationships with \nresidents of Iraq raise important foreign influence security concerns. In 2014, he worked \nfor three days to help Iraqi citizens vote in an Iraqi election, raising an important foreign \npreference security concern. The foreign preference security concern is mitigated by his \noffer to renounce his Iraqi citizenship and his oath of allegiance to the United States. \n \nApplicant served as a linguist, translator, or cultural advisor in Iraq. He made \ncontributions at personal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Iraq. All these \ncircumstances increase the probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report \nany attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit \nhim. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). One colonel, one \nlieutenant colonel, and one major wrote letters lauding his professionalism, diligence, \nand honorable service to the United States in a combat zone. His base was bombed, \nand his patrol was fired upon three times. He received five certificates of appreciation \nfrom units in Iraq praising him for his contributions to mission accomplishment. His past \nhonorable service as a linguist and intention to continue that service weighs heavily \ntowards mitigation of foreign influence security concerns. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (affirming grant of security clearance and commenting \n\u201cApplicant has served as a translator and as a cultural liaison between Americans and \nAfghan citizens, diffusing tensions and facilitating transactions between the two groups. \n. . . Applicant put his life in danger on at least one occasion to protect American lives \nand interests in Afghanistan.\u201d). \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole \nperson. I conclude foreign influence and foreign preference security concerns are \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n                                            \n9 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd.

Ranish, Esq.  \n04/20/2018\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. He failed to present sufficient evidence to explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concern stemming from his history failing to file income \ntax returns. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 19, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that \nhis circumstances raised security concerns under the financial considerations   guideline.1 \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 12, 2017, and requested a hearing to establish \nhis eligibility for continued access to classified information. \nOn March 26, 2018, a date mutually agreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. \nApplicant testified at the hearing. The Government offered two exhibits, which were \n1 The DOD CAF took this action under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  \n\n2 \n \nmarked for identification as GE 1 and 2 and were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A and B were admitted without objection. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \nwas received on April 4, 2018. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nOn December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD-\n4), establishing a \u201csingle, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position.\u201d2 The National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (hereinafter \u201cnew \nadjudicative guidelines\u201d or \u201cAG\u201d), which are found in Appendix A to SEAD-4, are to be \nused in all security clearance cases decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.3 In light of \nthis explicit direction (and absent lawful authority to the contrary), I have applied the new \nadjudicative guidelines. ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003) (security \nclearance decisions must be based on current DoD policy and standards).4 DOD CAF \nadjudicators reviewed this case using the previous version of the adjudicative guidelines, \ndated September 1, 2006, which were in effect at the time. My decision and formal \nfindings under the revised Guideline F would not be different under the 2006 Guideline F.  \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to delete the \nallegations of failure to timely file federal and state returns from 2006 to 2015, so that the \nSOR would allege only that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state returns from \n2010 to 2015. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not object, and I granted the motion to amend.5 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 38 years old, a college graduate, unmarried, and with no children. \nSince March 2010, he has worked for a defense contractor.6 \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income \ntax returns for the tax years 2006 through 2015.7 Applicant answered that he filed his \n                                                          \n2 SEAD-4, \u00b6 B, Purpose.  \n \n3 SEAD-4, \u00b6 C, Applicability.  \n \n4 See also ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant admitted with \nexplanations that he did not timely file his federal and state for 2010 through 2015.8  \n \nApplicant testified that in September 2016 he suffered a life-threatening medical \ncondition and had to be resuscitated. The experience made him appreciate his family and \nhis friends at work. He did not, however, attribute that experience or any other medical \nreasons or other explanations for failing to timely file his 2010 to 2015 tax returns.9 \n \nInstead, Applicant blamed those failures to file timely on his opening of an online \ninvestment account in about 2009 or 2010. He was trying to buy some stock online. \nApplicant got locked out of his account and was told by the investment firm that he needed \nto verify his identity. So, he went to his credit union, which gave him a notarized document \nbut said it would not prove to the investment account that he was who he claimed to be. \nThe investment account told him he needed to go to a lawyer. At about this time, he \nwanted to prepare his tax returns and tried to log in to his investment account to get the \nproper forms for the IRS and state taxing authorities. Since taxes were routinely withheld \nfrom his paychecks, he did not anticipate owing any taxes. He did not believe, however, \nthat he could file his returns without having the forms from the investment account. And \nhe was not able to access those forms.10 \n \nApplicant testified about his background interview with the OPM investigator in \nApril 2016. Applicant discussed his tax filing problem, and the investigator asked if \nApplicant had funded the investment account.  Applicant said he had not, and he was told \nby the investigator that in that event, he did not need any forms from the investment \naccount to file his tax returns. Applicant did not realize that, and within a few months of \nthat interview, he had filed all late returns. He owed less than $1,000 in taxes.11 \n \nOn cross-examination, Applicant was asked that since he was an IT specialist, why \ncould he not access his investment account? He answered that because he was not an \nIT administrator for that account; only the investment firm\u2019s IT administrators could access \nhis account. Applicant was asked whether he sought help from a tax professional or a tax \npreparer. He answered that he did not, even though he knew his tax returns were due on \nApril 15 each year. He also said that lack of finances did not prevent him from seeking \nprofessional help with his taxes. Before opening the investment account, Applicant had \nalways timely filed his tax returns since 1998.12 \n                                                          \n8 Answer. \n \n9 Tr. 12, 31.  \n \n10 Tr. 13-15.  \n \n11 Tr. 15-18. Applicant also testified than he attended a FDIC Lending Smart Course regarding finances \nand taxes, and that going forward, will file all his tax returns on time. Id. 18. The record does not show \nwhen Applicant attended the FDIC course, before or after he filed his late returns. The most credible \ninference is that Applicant attended this course sometime after his OPM interview.  \n  \n12 Tr. 24-26, 30-31.  \n \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant was examined on why he failed to disclose on his security clearance \napplication in June 2016 that he had unfiled tax returns.13 He said that he was under \nstress from filling out the security clearance application and from the job-related stress of \nproviding IT support for over 200 individuals in his department.14  \n \nApplicant\u2019s attention was called to the summary report of his background interview \nin April 2016 when he told the investigator that he had been \u201clazy\u201d and could not get the \ntax documents from his investment account.15 Applicant testified that he did not like the \nword \u201clazy,\u201d that he was tired \u201cafter work,\u201d with a work day from 4:00 AM until after 5:00 \nPM (including commute).16  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to authorize \nsuch access. E.O. 10865 \u00a7 2; SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, \nconsidering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial \ndecision. SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(c), 2(d). \n \nDepartment Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.

ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). \n                                                          \n \n \n13 Counsel for Applicant objected to this questioning, because it was not alleged in the SOR. I overruled \nthat objection, on the grounds that it went to the whole-person concept and to Applicant\u2019s credibility. Tr. \n28. Even though not alleged in the SOR, such matters may be considered on the issue of Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility. See ISCR Case No. 08-09232 at 3 (Sep. 9, 2010).  \n \n14 Tr. 33-34.  \n \n15 GE 2.  \n \n16 Tr. 34-35.  \n\n5 \n \nIn resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility, \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(b). See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has a number of delinquent debts, which \npurportedly raise a security concern under Guideline F. The financial considerations \nsecurity concern is explained at AG \u00b6 18, which in pertinent part, states: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  \n \n Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial \nissues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality \nto pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to \ndelinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person\u2019s \nself-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.17 \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f):   failure to file\u2026annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \n. . . as required; \n \n                                                          \n17 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).  \n \n\n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c):  the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g):    the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection or tax enforcement \nprocess. Rather, an administrative judge examines the way an applicant handles   \npersonal financial obligations to assess how they may handle their security obligations.18 \n\u201cFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with \nwell-established government rules and systems.\u201d19 Here, Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility was called into question by his history of failing to timely file his income tax \nreturns. I conclude that disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f) applies. The next inquiry is \nwhether any mitigating conditions apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file began with his obligation to file his 2010 tax returns in \n2011. That failure continued annually until after his background interview in April 2016, \nwhen he was told that he did not need any investment account forms to file his returns. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was not infrequent, nor did it occur that long ago. Therefore, AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. \n \n Applicant claimed that he failed to file, because he could not access his \ninvestment account for forms he believed necessary to file his returns. Even if I credit that \nas a circumstance largely beyond his control, the next inquiry is whether Applicant acted \nresponsibly under those circumstances.20 Confronted with this problem, however, he did \nnothing further to solve it. He did not seek professional help from a tax preparer or a tax \n                                                          \n18 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016). \n \n19 ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002).  \n \n20 That Applicant may have been \u201ctired after work\u201d is not a circumstance largely beyond his control.  Millions \nof taxpayers, many of whom may also be tired after work, are expected to comply with their annual income \ntax obligations. This is especially true of individuals who seek access to classified information.  \n\n7 \n \nadvisor. And Applicant admitted that his financial situation did not prevent him from \nseeking such assistance. Applicant knew that his tax returns were due on April 15 of each \nyear. He simply let each tax filing deadline go by, until he completed his security clearance \napplication and was interviewed by an OPM investigator. This is not responsible conduct. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant attended an FDIC Lending Smart Course regarding finances and taxes. \nOn this record it appears, however, that he did so after his background interview. \nNonetheless, I give him partial, but not complete, mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). \n \nThe record shows that once Applicant was alerted by the OPM investigator that he \ncould file his back returns, Applicant did so, and that he owed less than $1,000 in back \ntaxes. Even if I credit Applicant with bringing his tax obligations up to date under AG \u00b6 \n20(g), his history of late filing of federal and state income tax returns is not fully mitigated. \nApplicant \u201cdid not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required \nof persons granted access to classified information.\u201d21 \n \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.22 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      Against Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \n \n \n    Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n21 ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). \n \n22 AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  \n \n\n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to classified information.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPhilip J.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct, personal conduct, and financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 18, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline J (criminal \nconduct) and Guideline E (personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG).1 \n1 I considered this case under the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. I also considered it under \nthe previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using either set \nof AG. \n04/11/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 31, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2018. The \ncase was closed due to loss of jurisdiction on January 23, 2018, as Applicant was \nseparated by his sponsor employer, a DOD contractor, in August 2017. The case was \nreopened and assigned to me on October 22, 2018, when Applicant was re-sponsored \nby another DOD contractor.  \n \nOn November 2, 2018, the Government amended the SOR pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 \nof the Directive, to add allegations under Guideline F (financial considerations), \nnumbered \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.m. Applicant responded to the amended SOR on November 9, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \n(NOH) on November 13, 2018, scheduling the hearing for November 27, 2018. \nApplicant waived the 15-day notice requirement. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 3 through 13 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection to the admission of GE 2, consisting of \nunauthenticated reports of investigation for background interviews conducted on \nFebruary 18 and March 24, 2016, and it was not admitted in evidence. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F, which I admitted in \nevidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until January \n4, 2019, for additional evidence. By that date, Applicant submitted additional \ndocumentation, which I marked collectively as AE G and admitted in evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 6, 2018.2                                        \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d-1.f, 3.a-3.m, and he denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 2.a. He is 29 years old, single, and he has one child, a minor.3 \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2007. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2011 and a master\u2019s degree in 2015. As of the date of the hearing, he was enrolling to \nearn a second master\u2019s degree. He worked for previous DOD contractors from \napproximately 2015 to 2017. He received an offer of employment from a DOD \ncontractor in September 2018, contingent on obtaining a security clearance. He has \nnever held a clearance, and his interim clearance from November 2016 was suspended \nafter the issuance of the SOR.4  \n \n \nIn September 2012, Applicant was charged with driving with a suspended \nlicense; he denied that he was arrested (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a). He was pulled over by a \npolice officer for driving with a suspended license, which stemmed from an unpaid \ntraffic-related ticket. As instructed by the officer, he left his car parked and a friend \n                                                     \n2 Tr. at 21-22, 27-31, 114-116. \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 8, 15, 37, 61-62, 107-110; GE 1. \n \n4 Tr. at 8-12, 44, 50, 72-78, 104-107; GE 1; AE B. \n\n \n3 \n \npicked him up. He immediately called the state motor vehicle administration, paid the \n$100 ticket, and returned to retrieve his car the next day.5  \n \n \nIn May 2014, Applicant was charged with negligent driving in a careless and \nimprudent manner, endangering property, life, and person, and driving under the \ninfluence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 2.a). He was on a date with his child\u2019s mother at a sushi \nrestaurant. He drank sake for the first time. He did not feel intoxicated so he drove \nhome. As he approached his home, the road that he lived on was flooded. He \nunknowingly drove his car on top of a submerged tree, then called the police for \nassistance. The responding officer asked him if he had been drinking, and he said \u201cYes\u201d \nand disclosed that he had consumed a \u201ccouple of sak[e]s.\u201d The officer looked into his \neyes with a flashlight and administered a walk-and-turn sobriety test. The officer then \nplaced him in the front seat of the officer\u2019s car, without handcuffs, and drove him to the \nprecinct. There, he was administered a breathalyzer test and tested under the legal \nlimit. He received 18 months of probation before judgment, a $140 fine, and he was \nordered to attend alcohol-education counseling. He completed probation, paid the fine, \nand attended alcohol counseling; he did not receive an alcohol-related diagnosis. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.a).6 \n \n \nIn July 2015, Applicant was charged with second-degree assault (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n2.a). This was his first domestic-violence-related charge. He was living with his child\u2019s \nmother and they got into a verbal argument. She called the police and reported that he \nhit her on her leg, which he denied. The case was placed on a stet docket. In August \n2015, the case was taken out of the stet docket when he was again charged with \nsecond-degree assault (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.a). He testified that he and his child\u2019s mother got \ninto another argument, after she hit him on his head with a remote. He denied hitting \nher. He stated that \u201cShe was coming at me in an aggressive way,\u201d so he threw her \npurse at her, and the buckle of the purse scratched her forehead and caused her to \nbleed. When the police arrived, they immediately arrested him upon seeing the blood on \nher forehead. At trial, his child\u2019s mother admitted that she lied about the July incident \nand he was consequently found not guilty of that charge. He received 24 months of \nprobation before judgment for the August charge, and he was ordered to attend \ndomestic-violence counseling. He completed counseling in 2016 and probation in 2017. \nHe has since returned to the counseling program on invitation to share his experiences \nwith other attendees.7 \n \n \nIn June 2018, Applicant was charged with second-degree assault for the third \ntime (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 2.a). He testified that he told his child\u2019s mother that he no longer \nwanted her living with him. He then went to his weekly church group and returned to a \nvandalized home. He told her to take what she wanted but leave their son with him, \nsince he was the sole breadwinner. He grabbed her keys and got into a tug-of-war with \nher over her cell phone, which he wanted to keep because he paid for it. When he let go \n                                                     \n5 Tr. at 35-37; GE 4. \n \n6 Tr. at 37-43, 53-56; GE 1, 3, 5-8. \n \n7 Tr. at 43-56, 64-65; GE 1, 3, 9, 10. \n\n \n4 \n \nof the phone, he fell backwards onto the floor, and as he was standing up, she said \u201cyou \njust hit me, I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d He gathered his belongings and went to a friend\u2019s \nhouse to spend the night. In the morning, he reported to the police station to try to \nprovide his statement to any report that she might have filed the previous night. He was \ngiven the name and number of the reporting officer, because the officer was not at the \nstation, and he left the officer a voicemail. He returned to the station when the officer did \nnot return his call, and another officer was sent to his home later that day. That officer \ntold him that there was no police report filed and he was not charged. He was thus \nsurprised when he received a court summons reflecting that he had, in fact, been \ncharged with second-degree assault. His child\u2019s mother claimed in a police report that \nhe hit her and placed her in a headlock. He hired an attorney and intends to fight the \ncharge. The case was scheduled for a pre-trial hearing in December 2018.8 \n \n \nApplicant testified that the relationship between him and his child\u2019s mother ended \nin December 2017. As her name is still on the lease, she has continued to reside in their \nhome approximately two to three days out of the week. He unsuccessfully attempted to \nremove her name from the lease. He has known her since elementary school. They \ndated briefly in high school but fell out of touch when their families moved. They \nreconnected and began dating again in May 2014. He testified that he did not take the \ntime to get to know her, and he learned throughout the course of their relationship that \nshe has a criminal background, to include domestic-violence-related charges from \nprevious relationships. He also learned that \u201cthe way that she communicates is through \nviolence. And she\u2019s clever. I have to give that to her because she calls the police.\u201d He \ntestified that he never initiated any violence, as he is not a violent person. He has not \nbrought domestic-violence-related charges against her because she is his child\u2019s \nmother and does not want her to get into trouble.9  \n \n \nIn the future, Applicant intends to be more pragmatic in how he assesses and \nresponds to situations involving his child\u2019s mother, and to call the police if necessary. \nHe no longer intends to protect her at his expense. He does not have any other \ncriminal-related incidents. He testified that his employer was aware of his 2014 and \n2015 charges, but he had not yet reported his 2018 charge. While he was concerned \nabout the impact on his employment that the outcome of his 2018 charge would have, \nhe was not concerned about his employer finding out about it.10  \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges the following delinquent accounts: a medical debt of $478 \n(SOR \u00b6 3.a); eight student loans totaling $118,656 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.i); and four consumer \naccounts totaling $1,602 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.j-3.m). The debts are established by a 2018 credit \nbureau report. Applicant also disclosed his debts in his 2015 security clearance \napplication (SCA).11  \n                                                     \n8 Tr. at 56-63, 66-68, 72, 108-109; GE 11, 13. \n \n9 Tr. at 53-56, 60-62, 64-69, 78-83, 104-105, 107-109, 123-128; GE 1; AE G. \n \n10 Tr. at 53-56, 60-62, 64-69, 78-83, 104-105, 107-109, 123-128; GE 1; AE G. \n \n11 GE 1, 12; AE Q. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to being the primary provider from \napproximately 2014 to 2018 for his child, his child\u2019s mother, and her 10-year-old child \nfrom a previous relationship. He was also involved in a no-fault car accident in which his \ncar was totaled. He received $4,000 from the accident, but he had to apply it towards \nthe expense of obtaining another car. He attributed his minor medical debt to his \ninvoluntary termination.12 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a is for a $478 medical debt. Applicant testified that he believed he had \nhealth insurance after his involuntary termination from a previous employer. He \nindicated that he did not receive a bill for his visit to an urgent care center for strep \nthroat, and he was unaware of this debt until he received the SOR. He researched the \ndebt and intended to resolve it with his tax refund.13  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b through 3.i are for Applicant\u2019s eight defaulted student loans from his \nbachelor\u2019s degree, totaling approximately $118,656. He testified that he first learned \nthat his loans were in default when he began working with the credit-repair company \nLexington Law in May 2018 to resolve his delinquent accounts, as he did not receive \nany delinquent notices. He contacted the U.S. Department of Education after he \nreceived the amended SOR in November 2018, and he set up an income-based \npayment plan of $5 monthly for nine months to get his loans out of default. As of the \ndate of the hearing, he paid a total of $10 towards that plan; he also made a $10 \npayment in December 2018. He intended to continue to abide by the payment plan, and \nonce his loans were out of default, he intended to make timely monthly payments \ntowards his student loans.14 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.j and 3.k are for two credit cards in collection for a total of $827. \nApplicant testified that he cosigned the credit cards for his child\u2019s mother in \napproximately 2015. He intended to resolve them with his tax refund.15 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.l is for a charged-off credit-card account for $238. Applicant testified that \nhe was a victim of identity theft or hacking, so he closed his account with the creditor in \n2015. He testified that he is a claimant to a pending federal lawsuit against the creditor, \nand he believed the account would be resolved through the lawsuit. He testified that he \ndisputed the debt through Lexington Law. Since he canceled his subscription with \nLexington Law, he intended to dispute the debt directly with the credit bureaus.16 \n \n                                                     \n12 Tr. at 83-105, 108-113. \n \n13 Tr. at 83-85, 91-92; GE 12. \n \n14 Tr. at 92-99, 110-111; GE 12; AE D, E, F, G. \n \n15 Tr. at 102; GE 12. \n \n16 Tr. at 102-104; GE 12. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.m is for another charged-off credit-card account for $537. Applicant \ntestified that this debt is for his credit card, which he forgot about. He intended to \nresolve it with his tax refund.17 \n \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant worked as a financial analyst for his \ncurrent employer. He was promoted in October 2018. His annual income was $61,200. \nHe testified that he received financial counseling from three credit-repair companies, \nCredit Karma in 2016, and Credit Sesame and Lexington Law in 2018. He canceled his \nsubscription to Lexington Law because he did not find them helpful; however, he was \ncontinuing to monitor his credit through Credit Sesame. He has also received budget \ntraining at work, and he has a budget. He is current on his rent of $1,225 monthly and \nhis car payment of $360 monthly. He continues to be primarily responsible for his child\u2019s \nexpenses, as his child\u2019s mother does not contribute. After expenses, his monthly net \nremainder is approximately $500. He has a savings account with a balance of $140. He \nhas a retirement account with an unknown balance. He testified that \u201cI\u2019m just now \nstarting to really take control of my finances,\u201d whereas in the past five years, he focused \non his immediate, day-to-day expenses.18 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s previous supervisor described Applicant as an \u201cexceptional member \nof our team,\u201d and stated that he had \u201cfull confidence in [Applicant\u2019s] ability to maintain [a \nsecurity clearance].\u201d Applicant\u2019s pastor of ten years described Applicant as a highly \nprofessional and trustworthy individual. A friend of ten years described Applicant to be \nan \u201cupstanding, centered, and skilled gentleman.\u201d19 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n                                                     \n17 Tr. at 104; GE 12.  \n \n18 Tr. at 66-67, 69-72, 76-79, 83-92, 98-102; AE E, F. \n \n19 AE A, B, C. \n\n \n7 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 31. The following is potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 charge for driving with a suspended license is a traffic-related \noffense. He was found not guilty of his July 2015 assault charge, after his child's mother \nadmitted that she lied about the underlying incident. I find that AG \u00b6 31(b) does not \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d and I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2014 alcohol-related charges occurred after he admitted to an officer \nthat he had consumed alcohol prior to driving his car over a tree submerged under \nwater. He acknowledged that he was arrested and charged with assault in August 2015 \nafter the officers saw blood on his child\u2019s mother\u2019s forehead. He acknowledged that he \nthrew her purse at her and the buckle of the purse scratched her forehead causing her \nto bleed. His 2018 assault charge is pending. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \n1.e, and 1.f. \nThe potentially relevant mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are as follows:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant resolved his one-time alcohol-related charges in 2014 through \nprobation before judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c and I \nfind SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nThough Applicant resolved the August 2015 assault charge through probation \nbefore judgment, his 2018 assault charge is pending. I am thus unable to find that such \nconduct is unlikely to recur, that he did not commit the offenses, that there is evidence \nof successful rehabilitation, or that so much time has elapsed and it does not cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32(c), and 32(d) are \nnot established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n\n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) do not apply to the 2012 \ntraffic-related offense or the July 2015 assault charge in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d. For the \nreasons set forth above, AG \u00b6 16(c) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f, and AG \u00b6 \n16(e)(1) also applies to SOR \u00b6 1.f. While Applicant testified that he reported his 2014 \nand 2015 charges to his employer, and he was not concerned about his employer \nfinding out about his 2018 assault charge, he had not yet reported it to his employer. He \nwas concerned about the impact that the outcome of his 2018 charge would have on his \nemployment.   \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline J analysis, AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), \n17(d), and 17(e) are established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and \n17(e), and 17(f) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, and thus Applicant has \nnot established mitigation for SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n11 \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he believed SOR \u00b6 3.l would be resolved through \na pending federal lawsuit in which he is a claimant, as the debt was incurred because \nhe was a victim of identity theft or hacking. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to SOR \u00b6 3.l and I find \nSOR \u00b6 3.l in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his \ncircumstances. He sought and received credit counseling, and he was continuing to \nmonitor his credit as of the date of the hearing. However, while he learned that his \nstudent loans were in default in May 2018, he did not contact the U.S. Department of \nEducation until after he received the amended SOR in November 2018. As of the date \nof the hearing, he had just started his nine-month rehabilitation plan and his student \nloans remained in default. He had not yet done anything to resolve his remaining debts, \nas he intended to do so with his tax refund. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and \n20(d) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.k and 3.m. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n\n \n12 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude he has not mitigated the criminal conduct, personal \nconduct, and financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.m:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 30-year-old project manager employed by a defense contractor since July 2005, when he graduated high school. He married in September 2015, and he and his wife have a son, born November 2016. He seeks to retain the clearance he was issued in November 2005. Applicant used alcohol under questionable circumstances from June 2008 to July 2012, resulting in three incidents indicative of poor judgment. In June 2008, he was charged with operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol (SOR 1.a). He received and completed probation before judgment, and the charge was dismissed. In August 2011, he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, when he had a .12% blood alcohol content (SOR 1.c). He was otherwise satisfactorily completing the terms of his sentence when he was again charged with driving under the influence (.12% blood alcohol content), and speeding, in May 2012 (SOR 1.d). Because of this second arrest, Applicant was found to be in violation of the terms of his probation for the August 2011 arrest, and received additional punishment (SOR 1.e). Applicant ultimately completed the sentencing requirements of these arrests, and has been off probation for over three years (Tr. 39, AE A).

O\u2019Connell, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case.  I grant Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 27 September 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal\nConduct, Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a\n2\nhearing before the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned\nConsisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE ) 1-8, and Applicant exhibit (AE) A.\n1\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on\n1 September 2006. On 10 December 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) signed Security\nExecutive Agent Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8 June 2017.\nThis decision is issued under the original AG, but I have examined the new AG to ensure that I would not\nreach a different result if I issued this decision under the new AG. I would not rule differently under either set\nof AG.\n1\n12/20/2018\n\nthe case to me 14 August 2017, and I convened a hearing on 28 September 2017.\nDOHA received the transcript 5 October 2017, and the record closed.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 30-year-old project manager \nemployed by a defense contractor since July 2005, when he graduated high school. He\nmarried in September 2015, and he and his wife have a son, born November 2016. He\nseeks to retain the clearance he was issued in November 2005.\nApplicant used alcohol under questionable circumstances from June 2008 to July\n2012, resulting in three incidents indicative of poor judgment. In June 2008, he was\ncharged with operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol (SOR 1.a). He received\nand completed probation before judgment, and the charge was dismissed. In August\n2011, he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, when he had a .12%\nblood alcohol content (SOR 1.c). He was otherwise satisfactorily completing the terms\nof his sentence when he was again charged with driving under the influence (.12%\nblood alcohol content), and speeding, in May 2012 (SOR 1.d). Because of this second\narrest, Applicant was found to be in violation of the terms of his probation for the August\n2011 arrest, and received additional punishment (SOR 1.e). Applicant ultimately\ncompleted the sentencing requirements of these arrests, and has been off probation for\nover three years (Tr. 39, AE A). Applicant\u2019s criminal record included a July 2010 driving\non a suspended license charge which was nolle prossed (SOR 1.b),  and a July 2012\n3\ncitation for possessing alcohol in a campground (SOR 1.e).4\nBetween 2008 and 2010, at a time Applicant was in an apprenticeship program\nwith his employer, Applicant used marijuana 2-3 times with coworkers. Applicant was\nnot aware that he had been granted a clearance in November 2005, but was aware that\nhe had applied for a clearance. Applicant has not used marijuana since 2010, and the\ncoworkers with whom he used marijuana are no longer employed by the company. \nApplicant acknowledged that his poor decisions reflect adversely on his\njudgment, but attributes them to his youth (Tr. 22, 42). However, he notes that since his\nmarriage and the birth of his son, his lifestyle has changed. His wife\u2019s family does not\nengage in the kind of misconduct that punctuated Applicant\u2019s youth, and he wants to set\na good example for his son and maintain the kind of good image his wife\u2019s family has.\nThe vice president of his company, who has known Applicant for over ten years, is\naware of his misconduct and recommends him for his clearance (Answer). He also\nsuccessfully completed a voluntary county outpatient substance abuse program in\nApplicant moved to a new state, and failed to comply with state requirements to transfer his license. His old \n3\nstate license was suspended, which was discovered during a routine traffic stop not otherwise alleged in the\nSOR.\nA park ranger observed a visitor to Applicant\u2019s campsite in possession of alcohol, a violation of campground\n4\nrules.  The visitor had left the campsite, but because the campsite was registered to Applicant, Applicant was\ncited, and paid a fine.\n2\n\nFebruary 2014, a program which included random drug and alcohol screenings, all of\nwhich were negative (Answer).\nPolicies\nThe AG list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for access to classified\ninformation. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nunder each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. Each decision must\nalso show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the factors listed in AG \u00b6\n2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case can be\nmeasured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or denial of a\nclearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant\nadjudicative guidelines are Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,\nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.5\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J, but\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. The dismissed July 2010 driving on a\nsuspended license charge and the July 2012 citation for possessing (constructively)\nalcohol in a campground lack security significance even under a disqualifying condition\nwhich contemplates a pattern of minor misconduct. However, three alcohol-related\narrests and a related probation violation constituted criminal conduct. Nevertheless, in\nthis case, even the combination of offenses does not raise any security concerns\nbeyond those considered under Guideline G, and while Applicant violated his probation\non his August 2011 arrest, he otherwise satisfactorily completed the court-ordered\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n3\n\nrequirements for that arrest as well as the other two arrests.  Moreover, even if I\n6\nconcluded that the disqualifying conditions were fully applicable, the corresponding\nmitigating conditions remove any security concerns.  Applicant completed all his\n7\nsentencing requirements and has an excellent employment record. Moreover, marriage,\nmaturity, and parenthood have had salutary influence on his life outlook. Accordingly, I\nresolve Guideline J for Applicant.\nIn similar fashion, the Government established a case for disqualification under\nGuideline G, by demonstrating Applicant\u2019s three alcohol-related arrests between June\n2008 and July 2012, the last of which triggered a probation violation.  Although the\n8\nrecord does not reflect a formal diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, such diagnosis is not\nrequired to raise a security concern.  Nevertheless, I find that Applicant has mitigated\n9\nthe security concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest was over six years aga, and he has not\nconsumed alcohol for several years. Thus, \u00b623(a) partially applies, in that I concluded\nthat enough time has passed and the conduct is unlikely to recur. However, while\n\u00b622(d)-(g) do not fully apply because there has been no documented diagnosis, and\n\u00b623(c)-(d) do not fully apply because of questions about the nature of Applicant\u2019s\ntreatment programs, \u00b623(b) fully applies.  Moreover, after his May 2012 charge,\n10\nApplicant took a different approach to his alcohol use problem. In addition to fully\ncomplying with the court requirements for education, Applicant voluntarily undertook a\nsubstance abuse program with the county, that he completed in 2014.\n\u00b631(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to affect a national security\n6\neligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness ; . . . (d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-ordered\nrehabilitation program;\n\u00b632(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened . . . that it is unlikely to recur and\n7\ndoes not cast doubt on the individuals\u2019 reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; (d) there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\nactivity, restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\nHowever, as with the criminal conduct concerns, the constructive alcohol possession citation does not really\n8\nhave any security significance under alcohol consumption as he was not consuming alcohol, and did not\nactually possess the alcohol.\n\u00b622(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\n9\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern . . .; (b) alcohol-related incidents at work,\nsuch as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition . . . regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; (c) habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment . . .; (d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional or mental\nhealth professional. . . of alcohol use disorder;\n\u00b623(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of\n10\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n4\n\n \nFurther, Applicant\u2019s character reference finds his reliability and work ethic to be\nexceptional. I conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse alcohol in the future. Accordingly, I\nresolve Guideline G for Applicant.\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s illegal drug abuse between 2008 and 2010, a period during\nwhich Applicant held a clearance, but Applicant mitigated the security concerns.11\nApplicant\u2019s drug use was essentially experimental, occurred right after high school, and\nended over seven years ago. Setting aside for the moment whether Applicant actually\nknew that he held a clearance, he knew that he had applied for one\u2014which put him on\nnotice of the Government\u2019s view of illegal drug use\u2014and it is unlikely his employer\ntolerated illegal drug involvement. Nevertheless, the drug use was minimal.\nDrug involvement mitigating conditions give much support to Applicant. His illegal\ndrug abuse was not recent, was not frequent, and seems unlikely to recur.  Applicant\u2019s\n12\nsubstance abuse program covered both his alcohol and marijuana use. All the use\noccurred before his marriage and parenthood, and with coworkers who are no longer\nwith the company.  Under the circumstances,  I conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse\n13\nillegal drugs in the future. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against Applicant.\nThe Government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E.\nThe conduct complained of\u2014the five criminal charges at SOR 1.a-1.e and the\nmarijuana use at SOR 3.a\u2014are fully cognizable as criminal conduct and drug use,\nrespectively. No critical mass is achieved by combining the two. The disqualifying\ncondition cited by the Government, \u00b616(d), is not satisfied.  Accordingly, I resolve\n14\nGuideline E for Applicant.\n \n\u00b625(a) any substance misuse; (c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . . ;(f) any illegal drug use\n11\nwhile granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position;\n\u00b626(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n12\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment [Emphasis supplied];\n\u00b626(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence\n13\nof actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not\nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used;\n\u00b616 (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be\n14\nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable, judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information. This included but is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3)\na pattern of . . . rule violations.\n5\n\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n___________ \n \nDecision \n___________ \n \nBENSON, Pamela C., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Given the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file \nFederal and state income tax returns for numerous years, his significant outstanding tax \ndelinquencies and unresolved promissory note, and the length of time they have been \nunresolved, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn February 5, 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn May 23, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. On June 8, \n2017, new AGs were implemented and are effective for decisions issued after that date.1  \n \n                                            \n1 I considered the previous AGs, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new AGs, effective June 8, \n2017. My decision would be the same if the case was considered under the previous AGs. \n12/17/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nOn September 21, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR, and requested a \nhearing. On March 28, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On June 28, 2018, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for July 25, 2018. Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits, Government \nExhibit (GE) 1-7, and Applicant offered ten exhibits, Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-J. There \nwere no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. On August 2, \n2018, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied all eight allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.h.   \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old licensed attorney. He honorably served in the U.S. Air \nForce on active duty from 1986 through 1992. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1985, a master\u2019s degree in 1987, and a juris doctorate in 2003. He is married and has \none adult child. He is sponsored for national security eligibility by a DOD contractor, for \nwhich Applicant is the Chief Executive Officer. (CEO) (Tr. 8-9; GE 1) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file state and Federal income tax \nreturns for multiple years. He owes three state tax debts, three Federal tax debts, and he \nhas an unsatisfied judgment. The combined total of Applicant\u2019s delinquent indebtedness \nis approximately $802,288. The record establishes the status of Applicant\u2019s unpaid \naccounts and untimely tax returns as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant failed to file state and Federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012. He denied this allegation \nin his SOR response because he has since filed all of his state and Federal income tax \nreturns. The testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant did not timely \nfile his state and Federal income tax returns for tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, \n2008, 2011, and 2012, as required. The income tax returns for tax year 2003 was filed in \n2006, and the income tax returns for tax years 2004 through 2008 were filed in 2009. Tax \nyears 2011 and 2012 income tax returns were filed in May 2014. (Tr. 10 -13, 49, 55, 89-\n91) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, c, and d allege Applicant had two state tax liens entered against him \nin 2013, and another state tax lien entered against him in 2016, in the combined total \namount of $37,097. Applicant denied these allegations in his response to the SOR. The \ntestimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant\u2019s state tax liens are unpaid \nand unresolved. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, and f allege Applicant had a Federal tax lien entered against him in \n2009, and another Federal tax lien entered against him in 2016, in the combined total \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \namount of $654,148. Applicant denied these allegations in his response to the SOR. The \ntestimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant\u2019s Federal tax liens are \nunpaid and unresolved. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent \n2005 income taxes in the amount of $20,225. He denied this allegation in his response to \nthe SOR. The testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that the Federal \nGovernment is currently claiming approximately $860,000 for Applicant\u2019s combined \ndelinquent Federal taxes. Applicant initiated a one-year repayment agreement to pay \n$500 per month to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) four weeks before his hearing. At \nthe time of his hearing, Applicant had not yet made any payments to the IRS for resolution \nof these delinquent taxes. (Tr. 15, 50, 72, 88, 92-93, 95; AE H; AE J) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant owes on a bank promissory note in the amount of \n$90,818. The bank filed a lawsuit against him in October 2014 to collect this debt. He \ndenied this allegation in his response to the SOR. The testimony and evidence at the \nhearing showed that this case is still pending litigation and the debt is unresolved. \nApplicant believes that he has repaid this debt in full and possibly overpaid the debt, but \nhe failed to provide evidence at the hearing showing his history of payments on this \naccount. Applicant claimed that he never received any statements from the bank and the \npayments on this note were automatically deducted from his bank account for years. He \ncalled his law partner as a witness since she represented Applicant during the litigation \nof the alleged promissory note, now valued at approximately $150,000. (Tr. 39) She \ntestified that the lawsuit was pending, and if she filed a motion to dismiss the case, she \nbelieved it would most likely be granted by the court. As of the date of the hearing, \nApplicant\u2019s attorney had not filed a motion to dismiss the case, and there was no evidence \npresented of Applicant\u2019s claimed payments on this account. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. \n20-21, 25-31, 33-35, 40, 77-78; AE A - G) \n \nApplicant stated that his financial problems stem from a catastrophic, million-dollar \nloss from a fire that damaged his rental property in 2003. He received a letter from his \ninsurance company the very day the fire occurred advising him that the insurance \ncompany would no longer insure his rental properties. Applicant suffered a heart attack \nshortly thereafter. He was financially ruined, and he borrowed $60,000 from his friends to \nsurvive. Applicant reported that he has repaid all that borrowed money to his friends. (Tr. \n10, 92) \n \nApplicant\u2019s office also burned in the fire, and he lost all business records. He did \nnot timely file state or Federal income tax returns for 2003, but he eventually filed those \nincome tax returns. He did not file his state and Federal income tax returns for tax year \n2004 because he was depressed, and he was on the verge of financial ruin. Applicant \neventually hired a certified public accountant (CPA). The CPA took Applicant\u2019s tax records \nand money, and made an appearance on his behalf before the IRS. About a year and a \nhalf later, the CPA kept the money, returned the tax records to Applicant, and told him he \ncould not help Applicant with his tax issues.  (Tr. 10-11) \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nApplicant hired a second CPA in about 2005, and he immediately noticed that his \nincome tax returns were finally being filed. The IRS requested to do an audit of Applicant\u2019s \nfiled 2009 and 2010 income tax returns. Applicant testified that he and his CPA met with \nan IRS representative. The IRS representative had Applicant sign a Power of Attorney \n(POA) for his CPA, and then she advised him that she would reschedule the audit. \nApplicant claimed the IRS representative instructed him not to open his mail from \nthe IRS because it would only upset him.  He thought that the IRS representative would \nsend the notices of the audits to Applicant and Applicant\u2019s tax representative(s), the CPA \nand eventually Applicant\u2019s sister, who is an IRS enrolled agent and was also added to \nApplicant\u2019s POA. (Tr. 11-13, 65-66, 84-85, 90) \n \nAfter an extended period of time, Applicant contacted his CPA to determine his \ncurrent tax status. The IRS audits for tax years 2009-2010 and 2012-2013 had already \noccurred when Applicant learned that the IRS failed to provide any notices of the audits \nto his tax representative(s). Applicant admitted that he had received an envelope from the \nIRS that contained the audit notice for both of his audits. He did not open any mail from \nthe IRS based on the advice he received from the IRS representative. Since no one \nappeared at the hearing for Applicant\u2019s Federal tax audits, all expenses reported on \nApplicant\u2019s 2009-2010, and 2012-2013 income tax returns were disallowed by the IRS for \ntax write-offs. (Tr. 12-13, 44, 64-70; AE I) \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, who is a tax expert, testified as a witness. She stated that the \nIRS agent\u2019s letter (AE I) pointed out that Applicant\u2019s CPA would not have been provided \na notice of the tax audit since her name was added to the POA in about 2016, which \nessentially cancelled the CPA on the POA. She also stated that, at one point in time, the \nCPA and she were both listed on the POA, but in late 2016 Applicant took action to have \nthe CPA\u2019s name removed from the POA. She believed Applicant\u2019s two audits, for tax \nyears 2009-2010 and 2012-2013, took place prior to her name being added on the POA, \nso she would not have received any of the audit notices. She did state that Applicant\u2019s \nCPA would have received these audit notices prior 2016. (Tr. 53) She testified that her \nbrother had talked with his CPA about the audit hearings and the CPA said he had it \nhandled. The CPA had obviously received the audit notices but he was not appearing at \nthe audit hearings, as he told her brother.2 (Tr. 58-59, 61) The audit for 2009-2010 tax \nyears would have most likely taken place in 2011 or 2012, and the audit for 2012-2013 \nwould have most likely taken place in 2014 or 2015. Applicant\u2019s sister filed Applicant\u2019s \n2016 and 2017 income tax returns. She stated that her brother owed taxes for both of \nthose tax years, but he did not pay the Federal taxes owed because he did not have the \nfunds. (Tr. 62)  She submitted a request for an audit reconsideration in September 2017 \nbut, as of the date of the hearing, the IRS had not yet responded to that request. (Tr. 42-\n47, 52-55, 58-63, 72; AE H; AE I) \n \n                                            \n2 Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony conflicts with Applicant\u2019s testimony that his CPA did not receive any audit \nnotices from the IRS. Applicant claimed that after the audits were over and no one appeared, he then \nreceived information from the IRS that showed he owed a horrendous amount of Federal taxes for those \naudited tax years. He admitted that he received the audit notices from the IRS. Applicant stated that his \nsister\u2019s testimony was in error. (Tr. 64-68, 73-74)  \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nApplicant stated that the total amount of Federal and state delinquent taxes were \nmerely unrealistic numbers due to his disallowed expenses. Applicant wishes to have his \ntax issues resolved so he can pay the actual tax money that is owed and be in complete \ncompliance. His most recent notice from the IRS disclosed that he currently owes \napproximately $860,000 for Federal tax liabilities. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) Applicant recently set-\nup a one-year repayment plan with the IRS covering tax years 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, \n2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, which includes all of the tax years with \ndelinquent Federal taxes owed. As of the date of his hearing, he had not yet made any \npayments on the one-year repayment plan. He noted that the state tax authority relies on \nthe Federal Government to determine an individual\u2019s tax liability. Once the Federal tax \nnumbers are correctly calculated, the state tax authority will then reset his state taxes, \ninterest, and penalties numbers. He has not yet made any payments on his outstanding \nstate taxes. (Tr. 13-15, 48-51; 61-62, 71, 76, 87-88; AE H, J) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Adverse \nclearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely based on whether the applicant has met the strict guidelines the \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Security Executive Agent have established for \nissuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I \nhave considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19, and the following \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant did not timely file his Federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012. The \nevidence also shows that he owes over $800,000 for delinquent taxes and an unresolved \npromissory note pending litigation. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012),  \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago,3 was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n                                            \n3 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant has not resolved his significant delinquent tax debt; nor has he paid, \nsettled, or resolved the bank promissory note pending litigation. He just recently entered \ninto a one-year repayment agreement with the IRS but has not yet started making his \nmonthly payments. Although he provided mitigating evidence of a fire and health \nconcerns during the 2003-2004 time period, which were circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, he does not have a reasonable explanation as to why he has been unable to \nresolve his tax issues during the past 14 years. Given the heavy burden generated by his \nfailure to timely file income tax returns or pay income taxes, the length of time the taxes \nhave been outstanding, and Applicant\u2019s unsubstantiated promise to resolve his debts, I \ncannot conclude that he has mitigated any of the financial considerations security \nconcerns. There are no indications that his tax and other financial problems are under \ncontrol, and I find it probable that future issues are likely to occur. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), (b), (c), (d) and 20(g) was not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nLooking at the totality of Applicant\u2019s tax history and circumstances, the evidence \nclearly shows that he does not possess the requisite good judgment, responsibility, and \ntrustworthiness required by individuals entrusted with protecting our nation\u2019s secrets. \nApplicant is a licensed attorney and should be expected to know and comply with his \nobligations under Federal and state tax laws. His self-serving explanation that he did not \nopen any mail from the IRS, to include important notices of his pending IRS audits, based \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \non an unsubstantiated and implausible claim concerning IRS representative\u2019s bad advice \nis purely irresponsible and unreasonable. \n \nGiven the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file Federal and \nstate income tax returns for numerous years, his significant outstanding tax and bank loan \ndelinquencies, and the length of time they have been unresolved, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n       Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nJanuary 26, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 10, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant  raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased against him,\nwhether the Judge erred in considering non-alleged matters, and whether the Judge\u2019s decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has been working in the defense industry since 2004.  He holds a master\u2019s degree. \nIn 2016, he downloaded, without authorization and in contravention of a non-disclosure agreement,\ncompany proprietary information onto an encrypted thumb drive and took the thumb drive with him\nafter leaving that company\u2019s employment.1  Shortly thereafter, he began working for a competitor\nof his former company.  He wanted to take the information because knew he would be working on\nthe same engineering technology in his new position and planned to use the information in question\nas a reference.  He stated the information was for his personal use, and he had no intention of sharing\nit with anyone else.  He indicated that he became aware of the severity of his actions when he\nreceived letters from the FBI and his former company.  An internal investigation concluded that he\nviolated company rules and regulations and committed a security violation.    \nApplicant claimed \u201che made an honest, naive, and very foolish mistake\u201d in taking the\nproprietary information and did not understand the ramifications of his actions.  Decision at 3.  A\ncounselor who provided him psychotherapy after he lost his security clearance in 2009 indicated he\nwould never knowingly damage an employer\u2019s privileged information.  His previously revoked\nsecurity clearance was reinstated in 2014.  He submitted letters from other individuals who attested\nto his good character.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant committed a serious security violation.  His downloading of proprietary\ninformation was deliberate.  He knew or should have known such conduct violated company rules\nand regulations.  \u201cFurthermore, he has a history of negligence and misconduct.  His security\nclearance was first revoked in 2009.  In 2014, Applicant, made some very improper decisions that\nhave now negatively impacted his current clearance.\u201d  Decision at 5.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable. \n1 Applicant also had a covenant not to compete that precluded him from taking technology from his former\ncompany.   Decision at 3.  \n2\n\nDiscussion\nApplicant claims the Judge was biased against him.  Specifically, he stated that the Judge\nacted in a manner that made him \u201cfeel like she departed from her role as impartial arbitrator.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 1.  He also stated that his wife who attended the hearing shared the same sentiment. \nExcept for the assignments of error addressed below, Applicant does not point to any specific\ncomment or action by the Judge that caused him to believe she was biased against him.2  There is\na rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome\nthat presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-02364 at 2 (App.\nBd. Apr. 4, 2011).  From our review of the record, we find nothing to support Applicant\u2019s contention\nthat Judge lacked the requisite impartiality.  \nApplicant raises two issues related to Government Exhibit (GE) 3, a Joint Personnel\nAdjudication System (JPAS) Incident History.  First, Applicant contends the Judge erred in the\nDecision by stating that he did not object to GE 3.  The transcript supports his contention that he\nobjected to the relevance of that exhibit at the hearing.  The Judge overruled his objection and\nadmitted GE 3 into evidence.  Tr. 20-21.  Besides entries addressing Applicant\u2019s alleged misconduct,\nGE 3 also has entries indicating that his SCI access was suspended in 2009 and later revoked.  He\nargues the information about his 2009 SCI access suspension and revocation was irrelevant.  We do\nnot find his argument persuasive.  The JPAS Incident History is a Federal Government record that\ncontains relevant information about an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.  We conclude the\nJudge committed no error in admitting the JPAS Incident History into evidence.3  \nSecond, Applicant also contends the Judge erred in considering that his security clearance\nwas revoked in 2009.  He argues that consideration of that prior suspension/revocation of his\nsecurity clearance was unfair and prejudicial.  It is well established, however,  that a Judge may\nconsider unfavorable non-alleged matters for certain limited purposes, such as (a) in assessing an\napplicant\u2019s credibility; (b) in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or\nchanged circumstances; (c) in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful\nrehabilitation; and (d) in applying the whole-person concept.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369\nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017).  We find no reason to conclude the Judge considered non-alleged\nmatters for inappropriate purposes.  \nApplicant also challenges that Judge\u2019s conclusion that he \u201cmade some very improper\ndecisions\u201d in 2014 that negatively impacts his current clearance eligibility.  He argues that nothing\nnegative happened in 2014.  The record supports Applicant\u2019s contention.  This error, however, is\n2 In his appeal brief, Applicant notifies us for the first time that he did not receive a copy of the transcript of\nthe hearing.  More specifically, he did not notify us that he had not received the transcript in either his Notice of Appeal\nor subsequent requests for appeal brief filing extensions.  His appeal brief merely mentions that he did not receive the\ntranscript and does not raise that matter as an issue for which he is seeking any relief.    \n3 We also note that, in addition to GE 3, Applicant\u2019s testimony and other evidence reflected his security\nclearance was suspended in 2009, later revoked, and was reinstated in 2014.  Tr. 34, 45-53, 69, GE 1 and 2, and\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A and D. \n3\n\nharmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184\nat 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).4  Applicant\u2019s conduct in wrongfully taking proprietary information\nwhen he departing a company\u2019s employment to work for a competitor in 2016 was more than a\nsufficient basis for denying his security clearance eligibility.       \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence.  He argues, for example, that he is responsible and trustworthy.  However, a party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017).\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d\n4 It appears the Judge committed a drafting error in stating 2014 instead of 2016.  \n4\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan             \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

On January 10, 2018, the SOR\nwas amended by withdrawing some Guideline F allegations and adding Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) allegations. Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 24, 2018, after the hearing,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Caroline E. Heintzelman\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is 57 year old, has worked off and on for defense contractors since the early\n1990s.  He has married twice and has three children.  In 2011, he was fired from a company for\nimproperly charging about 530 hours of work to Government contracts.  Although he received\ntraining regarding timecard accounting, he claims he did not know he improperly charged hours to\nthe Government.  He contends that he kept personal time records and only failed to account for 60\nhours.   Due to his conduct, he was barred from working on Executive Branch contracts from May\n2012 to March 2015.  He was given an opportunity to present evidence challenging the debarment,\nbut did not provide matters in opposition.\nIn February 2012, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) at another\ncompany in which he did not disclose his prior employment termination.  He indicated the he left\nthat job due to downsizing.  He also failed to disclose that he had two debts over 120 days\ndelinquent and had a vehicle recently repossessed.  While he testified that an agency hired to help\nhim complete the SCA failed to disclose negative information in that form, he also acknowledged\nhe knew the information was not truthful when he signed it.  \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had 14 delinquent debts totaling about $42,000.  With\nthe exception of three debts, he admitted each of them.  He claims he paid about $1,000 toward some\nto the debts, but provided no proof of the payments.  His recent credit reports reflect two new\ndelinquent debts totaling over $800.  He and his wife earn about $227,000 annually.  Applicant\n\u201cblames his financial struggles on his unexpected unemployment in 2011.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Since\nthen, he experienced periods of unemployment, and he and his wife maintained separate households.\nIn 2014, he purchased one vehicle and leased another that resulted in monthly payments of almost\n$1,600. \nWhen his first marriage ended in divorce, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which\nincluded credit card debt and the balance owed on a repossessed vehicle.   A 2004 JPAS entry\nreflected Applicant misused a company credit card by making personal purchases totaling over\n$4,500.  He testified he only charged $200 and was unaware he could not use the card for personal\n2\n\npurchases.  At the time of the hearing, he had not filed his 2017 Federal and state tax returns and\nowed the IRS about $50,000 in past-due taxes for 2011-2016.  He has been making monthly\npayments to the IRS of $690 since 2017.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant provided no proof of payments to resolve his delinquent debts.  His periods of\nunemployment were not shown to be circumstances beyond his control.  His financial problems\nreflect poor self-control, lack of judgment, and unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.\nApplicant admitted the Guideline E allegations, but disputed the number of hours he\nimproperly charged to the Government.  He did not contest his 2012 debarment.  He provided false\ninformation in his 2012 SCA.  His dishonest behavior is not infrequent.  At the hearing, he\nminimized his behavior and failed to accept responsibility for his actions.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29. \nAs best we can discern, Applicant is challenging the Judge\u2019s conclusions that he falsified his\nSCA by failing to disclose he was fired from a job in 2011 and had reportable delinquent debts.  The\nSOR did not allege that Applicant falsified his SCA.  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s\nfindings about Applicant falsifying his SCA were based on substantial evidence or constituted \nreasonable inferences that could be drawn from the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at\n3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).  A Judge may consider conduct not alleged for purposes such as\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation, assessing credibility, or applying the whole-person\nconcept.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017).  We find no basis for\nconcluding the Judge considered non-alleged conduct in an inappropriate manner.   \nApplicant further contends the Judge erred in concluding his periods of unemployment were\nnot conditions beyond his control.  In doing so, he states, \u201cIt is because, after the termination in\n2012, my employment has been very restricted and very unstable, and unemployment occurred very\noften due to my clearance status.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 8.  Since Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment\ncan be traced back to his wrongful conduct, we find no basis to disturb the Judge\u2019s challenged\nconclusion. \nApplicant makes a number of other arguments that are, in essence, a challenge to the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence.  For example, he contends that the number of hours he improperly charged\nthe Government was significantly inflated, that a number of years have passed since that incident\nhappened, that his unexpected firing caused his financial problems, and that he is in the process of\nresolving his tax problems.  Additionally, he challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he minimized\nhis behavior and failed to fully accept responsibility.  These arguments, however, are insufficient\n3\n\nto show the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).   \nFinally, Applicant argues, if he is unable to work, he cannot resolve his debts.  But, it is well\nestablished that the adverse impact that an unfavorable decision may have on an applicant is not a\nrelevant or material consideration in evaluating an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 14-04202 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 24, 2015).   \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJane M. Reynolds, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n28, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision\n\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan.\n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 23, 2017, and\nOctober 17, 2018, the SOR was amended.1 On December 17, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He retired honorably from the\nmilitary.  He has been married twice and has five children.  He is separated from his wife and resides\nwith his special-needs child.  He and his wife are trying to reconcile.  \nThe SOR alleges four financial concerns (Chapter 13 bankruptcy dismissed in 2016; Chapter\n7 bankruptcy discharge granted in 2017; Federal tax debt of about $45,700 for 2009 and 2011\nthrough 2015; and failure to file Federal tax returns on time for 2009 through 2015) and cross-\nalleges two alcohol consumption and criminal conduct concerns (discharge of a firearm from a\nmoving vehicle after consuming alcohol in 2011 for which he was sentenced to 180 days\nincarceration with 165 days suspended; and reckless handling of a firearm, swearing in public, and\npublic intoxication in 2015 for which he was sentenced to 12 months probation).  Applicant admitted\neach SOR allegation.  \nIn 2016, Applicant filed his past-due tax returns, and the IRS determined he owed about\n$35,000 in back taxes.  In April 2018, he agreed with the IRS to a payment plan of $425 a month. \nHe is current with the IRS payment plan.  \nApplicant consumed alcohol to deal with his problems and stress.  He sought substance abuse\ncounseling.  In 2015, he began consulting with a psychologist.  He last consumed alcohol the day\nbefore his mother\u2019s funeral in the fall of 2018.  The day before the hearing he began a Veteran\u2019s\nAffairs (VA) substance abuse rehabilitation program.  He recognizes that he needs alcohol treatment\nand does not intend to consume alcohol in the future.  The psychologist believes Applicant has taken\nthe counseling to heart and is developing positive coping skills.  \nWhile the receipt of a bankruptcy discharge does not amount to a good-faith resolution of\ndebts, Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings in 2016 and 2017 do not create a security concern.  Even\nthough he has filed his delinquent tax returns and is now paying his past-due taxes, his tax\ndeficiencies do not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons\n1 The SOR amendment on October 17, 2018, withdrew the earlier amendment.  \n2\n\ngranted access to classified information.  He did not provide sufficient evidence to show his tax\nproblems were resolved, under control, or unlikely to recur.  He has not acted responsibly and\nreliably.\n    \nApplicant was arrested twice for firing a weapon after consuming alcohol. He entered a VA\nsubstance abuse program the day before the hearing.  He has not presented sufficient evidence to\nestablish a pattern of abstinence to overcome his alcohol problems.  His criminal conduct did not\nhappen under unusual circumstances and the last offense happened only three years ago.  \n   \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence.  For example, he argues that he filed his delinquent tax returns and is making a good-faith\neffort to pay his taxes through a repayment plan.  He also notes that he is receiving alcohol\ntreatment, claims he is on his way to being rehabilitated, and maintains he should be given credit\nfor dealing with his problem.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the\nJudge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).\nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.

As amended, the SOR alleges\nthat Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2014, that he had four delinquent\nmedical debts totaling about $4,000, that he had delinquent tax debts totaling about $13,000, that\nhis wife is a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) who resides in the United States, and\nthat his parents-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC.  \nApplicant received an honorable discharge from the U.S. military in 2000.  From 2001 to late\n2009, he worked for a U.S. Government agency.  In 2007, he also started a company and mistakenly\nbelieved his investments in the company could be declared as losses on his  income tax returns.

Due to the disallowed losses, Applicant incurred an\nunpaid tax debt for 2011-2014.  With the economic decline in 2007 and 2008, he also sustained\nlosses on rental properties he had purchased.  \nWhile undergoing surgery in a foreign country in 2009, he suffered a \u201cmedical\nmisadventure\u201d that left him physically unable to perform his duties.  Decision at 3.  He retained\ncounsel to pursue a medical malpractice claim and, on the advice of counsel, remained in the foreign\ncountry to participate in the case.  He went into a leave-without-pay status after expending his\naccumulated leave.  Later that year, he resigned from his job when the U.S. Government agency\nproposed removing him from that employment.  He then used retirement funds to pay for living\nexpenses and returned to school to pursue a new career.   \nApplicant\u2019s medical malpractice case took longer than expected to resolve.  Despite having\nreceived disability payments for a portion of 2011, he started feeling financial pressure and used\ncredit cards to fund living expenses.  His injury and unemployment caused him to fall behind on his\n2\n\nmortgages, educational loans, and credit cards.  In March 2011, he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy.1  In\nmid-2011, he began working for a defense contractor.\nIn early 2014, Applicant received a $380,000 medical malpractice settlement.2  In March\n2014, he received a bankruptcy discharge that did not absolve him of his tax debt or educational\nloans.  Regarding the malpractice settlement, \u201cApplicant estimates he spent $62,000 paying off his\neducational loans, invested $70,000 in his business, and paid $15,000 for his continuing education. \nWith the $20,000 he gave to his father (for helping Applicant out in tough times), Applicant has\nfuzzily explained where the remaining $203,000 went.\u201d  Decision at 4.  \nApplicant continued working for defense contractors until he was laid off in late 2014.  He\nremained unemployed until he obtained his current job in late 2015.  He and his wife earn about\n$134,000 annually.  He provided proof that he paid a $52 medical debt in 2016.  In that year, he also\nentered into a repayment agreement with the IRS for his 2011-2014 taxes.  He provided proof of the\nrequired $212 monthly IRS payments from April through August 2016.  He did not document\npayment of the three remaining medical debts that appear to have aged off his credit reports.    \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in the PRC, attended college in the United States, and then\nworked in the PRC before returning to the United States following her engagement to Applicant. \nThey married in 2016.  She became a permanent U.S. resident in late 2016.  Her parents as well as\nher extended family members are resident citizens of the PRC.  Her father works at the district level\nof the PRC Government.  Her mother is retired.  Applicant communicates regularly with her mother\n1 In his bankruptcy petition (i.e., the Statement of Financial Affairs), Applicant checked the \u201cNone\u201d box\npertaining to the following request: \u201cList all suits and administrative proceedings to which the debtor is or was a party\nwithin one year immediately preceding the filing of this bankruptcy case.\u201d  Government Exhibit (GE) 5.  \u201cSection 541\nof the Bankruptcy Code provides that virtually all of a debtor\u2019s assets, including causes of action belonging to the debtor\nat the commencement of the bankruptcy case, vest in the bankruptcy estate upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition.  11\nU.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1); In re Swift, 129 F.3d at 795; COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY \u00a7 541.08.  Thus, a trustee as\nrepresentative of the bankruptcy estate, is the real party in interest, and is the only party with standing to prosecute causes\nof action belonging to the estate once the bankruptcy petition has been filed.\u201d  Kane v. National Union Fire Insurance\nCo. 535 F.3d 380, 385 (5th Cir. 2008). \n2 The record does not reflect whether Applicant notified the bankruptcy court or trustee of his malpractice\nsettlement before the bankruptcy discharge was issued.  The record, however, contains the following exchange:\n[Department Counsel]:  Okay. When you received it [the malpractice settlement], your bankruptcy\nwasn\u2019t fully discharged yet.  Is that correct?\n[Applicant]:  Correct.\n[Department Counsel]:  Okay.  Did you consider using any of the monies from your settlement to\nrepay the lenders you owed under that bankruptcy as opposed to continuing with the discharge?\n[Applicant]:  My trustee just wanted to close it out.  Her name is . . . . [ Tr. at 124.]  \n3\n\nand seldomly with her father.  She describes her extended family members as farmers and factory\nworkers.  \nThe PRC has an authoritarian government with a poor record for human rights.  It is an\nactive collector of U.S. economic intelligence and technology and engages in espionage against the\nUnited States.   Its intelligence services and private industry frequently seek to exploit Chinese\ncitizens or persons with family ties to the PRC to steal state secrets.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant meets most of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations.  He\nexperienced financial problems due to conditions beyond his control -- including a medical\nmisadventure that cost him a well-established career and periods of unemployment from December\n2009 to June 2011 and from October 2014 to December 2015 -- and largely dealt with his finances\nresponsibly.   His financial difficulties are not recent and are not likely to recur.  He promptly paid\nhis education loans once he received the malpractice settlement and entered into a repayment plan\nwith the IRS.  He was in contact with creditors well before the SOR (although the Judge noted there\nis no evidence of Applicant\u2019s efforts to contact the creditors of the aged-off medical debts) and made\na good-faith effort to resolve his debts.  Given his actions, the unpaid debts have little security\nsignificance.    \nApplicant\u2019s wife and her parents create a potential heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, but only because of the rebuttable presumption that\nhe has ties of affection and obligation to his wife and to his in-law through his wife.  His wife is\neffectively beyond the reach of the PRC.  She is a permanent U.S. resident and has no apparent\nconnection to the PRC Government.  These connections are too attenuated to raise any security risks. \nDiscussion\nDepartment Counsel argues that the record in this case does not support the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable mitigation analysis under Guidelines F and B.  More specifically, she contends that the\nJudge did not consider important aspects of the case and his analysis runs contrary to the weight of\nthe record evidence.  Most of Department Counsel\u2019s arguments have merit.3\n3 Department Counsel makes an argument that the Appeal Board has repeatedly rejected, i.e., \u201cWith respect\nto resolution of delinquent taxes, Mitigating Conditions 20(d) and 20(g) must be read in concert and harmony with the\noverall parameters of analysis set forth by the Appeal Board.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 27.  This is not accurate.  As we have\npreviously explained, \u201cThe Appeal Board and Hearing Office are creatures of the Directive.  While some analysis and\nprecedents might survive amendments to the Directive or guidelines, it is mistaken to believe that the guidelines are\nsomehow inferior to Appeal Board decisions.  More succinctly, the provision of the Directive, including the guidelines,\nare controlling.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 4, n.2 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018), ISCR Case No. 16-03187 at 4.\nn.4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018), and, most recently, ISCR Case No. 17-00944 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2019).  The Reply\nBrief also notes that the Judge did not mention Mitigating Condition 20(g).  Reply Brief at 17.  Additionally, Department\nCounsel argues the Judge erred in finding Applicant \u201creceived disability payments for a portion of 2011\" when he\nactually received such payments dating back to 2009.  While that finding may not reflect the full picture of the disability\npayments that Applicant received, that finding is not erroneous.   \n4\n\n \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s\ndecision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After\nthe Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to\nrebut or mitigate those concerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at\n3 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018).\nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate\na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts\nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment;\nit fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs\ncontrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference\nof opinion.  Id. at 4.\nDepartment Counsel challenges a number of the Judge\u2019s Guideline F conclusions.  For\nexample, she opposes the Judge\u2019s determination that Applicant\u2019s debts are not recent.  She argues\nthat, while Applicant's tax and medical debts may have existed for years, those problems were still\nunresolved.  The ongoing nature of most of his alleged delinquent debts vitiates a conclusion that\nhis financial problems are not recent and, thus, they continue to impugn his trustworthiness and\nreliability.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10575 at 3(App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2008).  Department Counsel\nalso notes that Applicant testified that he could have returned to work \u201cmuch sooner\u201d than he did\nfollowing his medical misadventure,4 and she argues the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant \u201clargely\ndealt with his finances responsibly\u201d is flawed.  She highlights that Applicant received the\nmalpractice settlement of $380,000 about one month before the bankruptcy court issued the debt\n4 Appeal Brief at 19, citing Tr. at 69.\n5\n\ndischarge order in March 2014.5  Between receipt of the settlement payment and the hearing,\nApplicant fully expended the settlement funds without paying his past-due taxes or delinquent\nmedical debts and can only account \u201cfuzzily\u201d for the expenditure of over $200,000 of those funds. \nHis expenditure of the funds on discretionary matters, such as expending about $70,000 on an\nendeavor that the IRS regards as a \u201chobby,\u201d instead of expending them on his delinquent financial\nobligations calls into question whether he acted responsibly under the circumstances.  Additionally,\nwhile Applicant established that he had an IRS installment agreement, he did not enter into that\nagreement until more than a year and a half after he submitted his security clearance application and\nmore than two years after he received the settlement payment.  The timing of an applicant\u2019s efforts\nat debt resolution is relevant in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 14-03358 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015).  Furthermore, Department Counsel points out that\nApplicant did not provide proof he paid three of the alleged delinquent medical debts, which the\nJudge indicated had apparently aged off Applicant\u2019s credit report.  As we have stated in the past, the\naging off of debts from a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as\nto the disposition of such debts.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03907 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2018). \nDepartment Counsel further observes that Applicant failed to filed his Federal income tax returns\nfor 2009-2012 as required.  In his post-hearing submission, he provided his IRS tax transcripts that\nreveal his Federal tax returns for those years were not filed until May 2015.6  The Judge did not\nfactor Applicant\u2019s tax filing deficiencies into his mitigation analysis.  Viewed in its entirety, the\nrecord evidence significantly undercuts the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant mitigated the alleged\nfinancial security concerns and, more specifically, that he acted responsibly in handling his financial\nproblems.\nDepartment Counsel also challenges a number of the Judge\u2019s conclusions in his Guideline\nB analysis.  At the outset, it merits noting the Judge apparently reached inconsistent conclusions\nregarding the application of Disqualifying Condition 7(a).7  On the one hand, the Judge concluded: \n5 The Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee\u2019s final report reflects that $235,972 of Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged\nwithout payment.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A.  \n6 AE W-Z.  In his security clearance application dated July, 28, 2014, Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to the question\nthat asked: \u201cIn the past seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law\nor ordinance?\u201d  GE 1.  Department Counsel calls into questions Applicant\u2019s testimony that the IRS contacted him in\nOctober or November 2014 regarding the disallowance of his 2011-2013 business expenses.  Department Counsel argues\nthat the IRS would have no basis to talk to him about those business expenses if he had not yet filed his income tax\nreturns for those years.  Appeal Brief at 29, citing Tr. at 134-135.  We also note that Applicant testified, \u201cI always filed\nmy taxes within the due date for the following year\u201d and \u201c . . . I have never not filed on time for any year that I actually\nhad W-2 income.\u201d  Tr. at 62 and 116, respectively.  On cross-examination, Applicant acknowledged that he did not file\nhis 2012 and 2013 tax returns until 2015 and he thought those delays had to do with his bankruptcy filing.  Tr. at 117-\n118.\n7 Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 7(a) states, \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion[.]\u201d\n6\n\nIn this case, the Government established that Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of the\nPRC, residing in the U.S., her parents are resident citizens of the PRC, and these\ncircumstances create a potential heightened risk of exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u2014but only because of the rebuttable presumption\nthat Applicant has ties of affection and obligation to his wife, and to his in-laws\nthrough his wife.8\nOn the other hand, the Judge later concluded, \u201c[t]here is nothing in the circumstances of [Applicant\u2019s\nin-laws] being in the PRC or in [his wife\u2019s] contacts with them, to heighten the risk that Applicant\ncould be impelled or compelled to provide protected information to the PRC.\u201d9  The Judge does not\nexplain how the circumstances of the case can create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation when\nthere is \u201cnothing in the circumstances  . . . to heighten\u201d such a risk.10  The Judge erred in making\nthese contradictory conclusions.      \nDepartment Counsel persuasively challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusions that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s\ncontacts with her parents are \u201cinfrequent,\u201d that Applicant \u201chas no connections whatsoever to the\nPRC[,]\u201d and Applicant\u2019s \u201cconnections are too attenuated to raise any security risks.\u201d  Decision at\n8.\n8 Decision at 8.  In his analysis, the Judge twice uses the term \u201cpotential heightened risk.\u201d  As reflected in the\nprevious footnote, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) does not contain the word \u201cpotential.\u201d  By using the term \u201cpotential\nheightened risk,\u201d it is unclear whether the Judge was attempting to conclude that Disqualifying Condition 7(a) applied\nin some limited fashion.  If that was his intention, he did not do so in a clear and understandable manner.  The word\n\u201crisk\u201d is defined as \u201cthe chance of injury, damage, or loss; dangerous chance; hazard[;] . . . to expose to the chance of\ninjury, damage, or loss[.]\u201d  Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary (3rd College Ed.)(1988) at 1159.  \u201cRisk\u201d encompasses  a\n\u201cpotential\u201d outcome.  Under Disqualifying Condition 7(a), \u201cheightened risk\u201d includes the \u201cpotential\u201d of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, etc.  We are unable to discern a meaningful distinction between the creation of a \u201cpotential\nheightened risk\u201d or a \u201cheightened risk,\u201d and are unsure what exactly the Judge meant by using that former term.  As we\nsaid in the past, the Judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows the parties and the Board to discern what\nfindings the Judge is making and what conclusions he or she is reaching.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 5 (App.\nBd. Aug. 23, 2018).  If the Judge did conclude that the evidence established something short of the \u201cheightened risk\u201d\nin Disqualifying Condition 7(a), then he erred.  As summarized in footnote 11 below, the evidence established a\n\u201cheightened risk\u201d under that disqualifying condition.  \n9 Decision at 9.  To understand this quote in its context, the full paragraph is set forth below:\nAlthough the U.S. and the PRC are global competitors, and the PRC is an active collector of\nprotected U.S. information and commercial information, Applicant is not situated in a position where\nhe is likely to be pressured.  Examining Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the Government\u2019s evidence that\nthere was a potential heightened risk of foreign, exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion because of Applicant\u2019s marriage to his wife, now permanently resident in the U.S., is\nextremely thin.  He has never met his father-in-law; he met his mother-in-law for five days, with no\nconversation other than that brokered by his then fiancee.  Her contacts with her parents are routine\nand infrequent.  There is nothing in the circumstances of their being in the PRC or in her contacts with\nthem, to heighten the risk that Applicant could be impelled or compelled to provide protected\ninformation to the PRC.  I find Guideline B for Applicant.\n10 A Judge is tasked with resolving apparent conflicts in the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00281 at\n4 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2014). \n7\n\nOf note, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s wife communicates with her mother about once or twice\na week by text and about once a month by telephone.  This finding is at odds with his conclusion\nthat Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s contacts with her parents are \u201cinfrequent.\u201d  Additionally, the record contains\nsubstantial evidence to establish the Guideline B allegations and the resultant security concerns\nunder Disqualifying Condition 7(a).11  As we have stated elsewhere, the Directive presumes there\nis a nexus or rational connection between proven circumstances under any of the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security eligibility.  Direct or objective evidence of nexus in not required.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 13, 2018).  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\ncontacts to the PRC through his wife and her parents are too attenuated to raise security concerns\nis not sustainable.   \nWe also note the Judge asked the following questions in his analysis:\nHow is the PRC to bring pressure on a retired accountant and a local government\nconsultant, through their daughter, who has no professional background of interest\nto the PRC?  How is the PRC expected to pressure (or even find) the daughter to\npressure her to pressure Applicant to provide protected information?12 \nThe practical effect of those questions is to require Department Counsel to prove affirmatively the\nmethods the PRC uses to exploit PRC citizens or persons with family ties to the PRC.  The Directive\ndoes not require the Government to prove such matters to raise Guideline B security concerns. \nDepartment Counsel need only prove controverted facts in the SOR allegations.13 Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14.  Once the SOR allegations are admitted or proven, the burden shifted to Applicant to\nmitigate the resulting security concerns.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  By asking those questions, the Judge\nerred in placing the burden on the Government to prove matters that the Directive does not require. \nFurthermore, as it happens, the Judge need only have referred back to Page 5 of his decision to find\nthe answers to his questions.  There he would read his own findings that: \u201cThe PRC has a poor\nrecord with respect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and its practices include arbitrary\narrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners.  The PRC engages\n11 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018) (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in\nthe same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard to meet.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019).  The evidence that Applicant\u2019s wife was a citizen of the PRC; that her parents\nwere citizens and residents of the PRC; that she became a permanent U.S. resident about seven months before the\nhearing; that she maintains regular contact with her mother; that her father works for the PRC Government; and that the\nPRC Government is an active collector of U.S. protected information, engages in espionage against the United States,\nand frequently seeks to exploit PRC citizens or persons with family ties to the PRC to steal state secrets sufficiently\nestablished a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, etc. under Disqualifying Condition 7(a). \n12 Decision at 8.\n13 The allegations under Guideline B were amended (SOR \u00b6 2.a was modified and SOR \u00b6 2.b was added)  just\nbefore closing arguments were made.   Applicant was not asked to admit or deny the amended SOR allegations. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s Counsel stated, \u201cYour Honor, I think that [the SOR amendments] accurately reflects what the\nevidence was in the record, so no objection.\u201d  Tr. at 140-141.  \n8\n\nin espionage against the United States and is one of the two most active collectors of U.S. economic\nintelligence and technology.\u201d  \n  \nBased on our review of the record, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision failed to consider\nimportant aspects of the case and runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  Furthermore,\nwe conclude that the record evidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s security concerns under the Egan standard. \n9\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan            \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nApril 20, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\n\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August\n22, 2018, Department Counsel amended the SOR to add allegations under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) as well as an additional allegation under Guideline E.  On February 7, 2019, after the\nhearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W.\nLoughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge was biased; whether\nApplicant was denied due process; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is 58 years old, has a history of alcohol-related incidents and problems in the\nworkplace.  In about 1978 to 1979, he was arrested twice for driving under the influence (DUI). \nDuring an interview in 1987, he stated he was fined more that $100 for one DUI and could not recall\nthe amount of the fine for the other.  At the hearing, he could not remember being arrested for DUI\nduring that period but eventually conceded he was arrested as alleged.  Later, he again stated he\ncould not recall those incidents.  \u201cApplicant\u2019s testimony and statements about this and other\nincidents were evasive, inconsistent, and not credible.\u201d  Decision at 2.  \nIn 1988, Applicant was arrested and charged with drunk driving and speeding. A military\npolice report of the incident reflects his blood alcohol content measured \u201c12% and 13%.\u201d1  He pled\nguilty to reckless driving, paid a $200 fine, and had his driver\u2019s license suspended.   In 2007, he was\ncharged with public swearing/intoxication.  He paid a fine and the charge was dismissed.  In 2013,\nhe was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI).  He pled guilty to reckless\ndriving and was sentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended), probation for 12 months, a fine, and a\nrestricted driver\u2019s license.  In a later background interview, he stated the 2013 arrest was an isolated\nincident and denied ever being charged with any other alcohol-related offenses.  In his SOR\nresponse, he also stated, \u201cthis was my first and only offense in my entire driving history . . . .  I\nemphasize that this was my first offense, at that time, in my entire driving history.\u201d  Decision at 3,\nquoting from SOR Response.2  At the hearing, he testified that he did not intend to be dishonest with\nthose comments and thought the investigation was limited to the past seven years.  In 2014, he was\ncharged with reckless driving: improper brakes, and was found guilty of improper control/driving. \nHe attributed the last offense to stopping abruptly when a car cut in front of him while he was\nreaching for sunglasses.  \nIn 2007, Applicant was terminated from a job when multiple pornographic images were\ndiscovered on his network drive.  He claims he brought in a CD from home and accidently loaded\nthose images while he was copying other files.  \u201cHe stated that he was terminated the next day, \u2018on\nthe same day that [he] had planned to resign.\u2019\u201d  Decision at 4.  He provided a similar but slightly\ndifferent account during a 2009 background investigation. \n1 Decision at 2.  The military police report reflects Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol content was \u201c.12% and .13%.\u201d\n2 Of note, Applicant submitted his initial SOR response on May 24, 2018, about four months before the SOR\nwas amended to add other alcohol-related driving incidents.  \n2\n\nIn 2013, Applicant received a written reprimand for violating company policy when he\ndownloaded a file from his personal email account that contained multiple usernames and passwords\nfor DoD accounts and other personal information.  At that time, he was warned of potential\nconsequences for future security incidents.  Later that year, he plugged a personal phone into his\nwork computer and immediately removed it when he was told he was violating security rules.  About\na month later, he commented to the person next to him during a work meeting that, if he brought a\nfirearm, he could take out the entire leadership or a bomb could do the same.  He denied making a\nthreat and meant the comment as an observation about a lack of security.  \n \nThe Judge determined that two of the Guideline E allegations were duplicative, found in\nfavor of Applicant on one of them, and also concluded the allegation concerning the threatening\ncomment was not proven by substantial evidence.  The Judge further concluded that Applicant\u2019s\ninconsistent and contradictory testimony about his arrests are not worthy of belief and determined\nthe remaining security concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and judgment were\nunmitigated. \nDiscussion\nBias Issue\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends the Judge \u201cbecame angered with me and extremely\nintimidating for not recalling (incorrect count of two DUI\u2019s) and he did not allow me to explain why\nI felt the information was incorrect.\u201d  He further asserts that he felt the Judge \u201cbullied\u201d him into\nagreeing with a response when he was not comfortable with it.  Appeal Brief at 1.  These contentions\napparently pertain to Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding allegation SOR \u00b6 2.a that asserted he was\narrested and charged twice with DUI between 1978 and 1979.3  To the extent that Applicant is\ncontending the Judge was biased against him, we note there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge\nis impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of\npersuasion on appeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02391 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018)(citing,\nLiteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555-556 (1994) for the proposition that \u201cexpressions of\nimpatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, even anger\u201d do not establish bias.  \u201cA judge\u2019s ordinary\nefforts at courtroom administration\u2014even a stern and short-tempered judge\u2019s ordinary efforts at\ncourtroom administration\u2014remain immune.\u201d).  From our review of the record, we conclude there\nis no basis for Applicant\u2019s assertions.  See, e.g., Tr. at 103-110.  While the Judge interrupted\nApplicant\u2019s testimony to ask pointed questions, his questioning of Applicant was not inappropriate,\nand he provided Applicant ample opportunity to explain himself.  Furthermore, Applicant was\nrepresented at the hearing.  At no time during the segment of the hearing in question did Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel object to the Judge\u2019s questions or conduct.  Applicant\u2019s assertions are not sufficient to rebut\nthe presumption the Judge was impartial.  \nDue Process Issue\n3 SOR \u00b6 2.a states, \u201cBetween approximately 1978 and 1979, you were arrested on two occasions and charged\nwith Driving Under the Influence.\u201d \n3\n\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief also contends that he was denied the opportunity to present some\nevidence.  His appeal brief and Department Counsel\u2019s reply brief contain documents that are not in\nthe record.  Generally, we cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  The\nAppeal Board, however, can consider new evidence to address the threshold issues of jurisdiction\nand due process.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2015).  \nDuring the hearing held on January 23, 2019, the Judge indicated that he would leave the\nrecord open until February 1, 2019, to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit additional\nmatters.  Tr. at 134-135.  On January 24, 2019, Applicant\u2019s Counsel sent an email with an\nattachment to Department Counsel for submission to the Judge.  On that same day, the Judge\nresponded to both parties by saying, \u201cI have received the e-mail and attached document.  I will treat\nthe record as closed unless there is a specific request otherwise.\u201d  Reply Brief at Attachment 1.  No\nresponses or further emails from the parties about leaving the record open are in the record.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant notes the Judge closed the record on January 25, 2019, i.e., six\ndays prior to the \u201cagreed upon date.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  He also states his lawyer sent one\ndocument to DOHA without waiting for additional evidence he was seeking to send.  His appeal\nbrief contains two documents.  For purposes of resolving the appeal, we construe his brief as\nasserting that he intended to send the two documents to the Judge within the original time frame.  \nOne of the documents attached to Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is a copy of the Amendment to\nthe SOR with his circled and initialed \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny\u201d responses to each of the five allegations\nlisted in that document.  Interestingly, this copy of his response to the SOR Amendment does not\nmatch the one in the record.  In the record copy of his SOR Amendment response, Applicant circled\nand  initialed \u201cadmit\u201d for each of the five listed allegations.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel also provided two\nletters containing explanations for each of those five admissions.  In the copy of the SOR\nAmendment response attached to his appeal brief, he circled and initialed \u201cadmit\u201d for three of the\nallegations and \u201cdeny\u201d for the other two.  In the submitting that document, he stated, \u201cI also included\nthe 4 page amendment to the SOR which shows I Deny 2a. and 1g. which refers [cross-alleges] 2a.-\n2d. and explained why I feel Guideline G does not apply.\u201d  Appeal Brief Cover Letter.  However,\nhe does not explain why the copy he submitted with his appeal brief does not match the one in the\nrecord.  The copy of the SOR Amendment response attached to his appeal brief does not establish\nany due process violation.  Moreover, because it contradicts record evidence without any\nexplanation for that incongruity, it is considered new evidence and will not be considered in\nanalyzing the merits of his appeal.  \nThe other document attached to Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is a copy of a state court record. \nIt is apparently being offered regarding the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a.4  The court record reflects that\nhe was charged with operation while under the influence or while having an elevated blood alcohol\n4 In his appeal brief, Applicant asserts that he had \u201cone suspected DUI\u201d in 1980 instead of two as alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 2.a.  Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s adverse findings that Applicant was charged with public\nswearing/intoxication in 2007, but this was also an allegation that he admitted in responding to the SOR Amendment. \n4\n\ncontent and improper turn/stop.5   While the date of arrest is unreadable, it reflects that he pled guilty\nto reckless driving and was fined in May 1980.  In his brief, Applicant does not state that this\ndocument was forwarded either to his Counsel, Department Counsel, or the Judge before the original\ndeadline for closing the record (February 1, 2019).  Consequently, he has failed to establish a prima\nfacie case of a due process violation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02933 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 23,\n2016).  Moreover, in the unlikely event the state court record was forwarded to DOHA before the\noriginal deadline and did not make it into the record, such an error was harmless because it likely\ndid not affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15188 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25,\n2013).  Given that Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, the state court record is not\nsufficient to show that the Judge erred in his findings and conclusions regarding that allegation. \nFurthermore, even if the Judge would have found for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.a in light of that\ndocument, such a change in the findings would not likely have altered the ultimate adverse decision\nconsidering the other unfavorable SOR findings. \nOther Appeal Issues\nApplicant states that he has no violations or incidents over the past five years while working\nwith classified information and highlights his excellent job performance.  He also argues that he had\nthree reckless driving convictions over a period of 39 years with a 25-year span between the second\nand third offenses and such conduct does not show a pattern of excessive alcohol use.  His\narguments are not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in\nthe record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-04856 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017).  Additionally, an\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Id. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nDecember 28, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Department Counsel requested\na hearing.  On January 4, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He retired from the military\nin the early 2000s.   He admitted the SOR allegations with explanations.  In 2009, after attempting\nsuicide, he was committed to a hospital for observation and mental health treatment.  He was\ndischarged with the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe, with Psychotic\nFeatures.  \nIn 2017, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation by a licensed psychologist/clinical \nneuropsychologist who diagnosed him with Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe, with\nPsychotic Features; and Delusional Disorder, Prosecutory Type.  The psychologist concluded that\nApplicant\u2019s \u201ccurrent mental state and functioning impacts his ability, reliability, judgment, stability\nand trustworthiness in handling or safeguarding classified information.\u201d  Decision at 6, quoting from \nGovernment Exhibit 3.  The psychologist also noted that he agreed with Applicant\u2019s treating\npsychiatrist that Applicant \u201cis able to perform his job, and does not have a history of aggression or\nbeing fired from his place of employment.\u201d  Id.  Applicant\u2019s treating psychologist stated that\nApplicant \u201cis a very willing and cooperative client who has an excellent prognosis.\u201d  Decision at 7,\nquoting from Applicant Exhibit B.  \nThe Judge concluded that none of the mitigating conditions applied with enough force to\novercome the weight of the evidence.  Applicant is still subject to delusions.  The Judge noted that\nthe \u201cexcellent prognosis\u201d came from the psychologist who is treating Applicant for anxiety issues\nas opposed to depressive, psychotic, and delusional mental health concerns.  Decision at 11.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends the Judge erred in his application of the mitigating conditions.  He asserts\nhis anxiety issues are being treated, notes that his psychiatrist is working to resolve his\ndepression/delusion issues with new medication, and argues that his ability to function at work\nmitigates the security concerns.  Such arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\n2\n\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2016). \nAs best we can discern, Applicant also is contending that the security clearance application\nstates \u201cthat mental issues alone should not be use for disallowing clearances.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1. \nApplicant may be referring to the provision in his security clearance application that states,\n\u201c[m]ental health counseling in and of itself is not a reason to revoke or deny eligibility for access\nto classified information or for a sensitive position . . . .\u201d  Government Exhibit 1 at 24.  Applicant\nis misinterpreting the language of the quoted provision.  Applicant\u2019s case involves not just \u201cmental\nhealth counseling\u201d but also includes a mental health diagnosis that he has a condition that impacts\nhis ability, reliability, judgment, stability, and trustworthiness.  The Judge did not err in his\napplication of the Guideline I disqualifying conditions.  \nApplicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.  The\nJudge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.\u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with\nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness designation. \nOn September 14, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 30, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\ntrustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\ncontained errors and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has worked for her current employer, a Federal contractor, since November 2018. \nThis is her first application for access to protected information.  Applicant has worked for other\nFederal contractors since 2002.  However, she experienced unemployment from June to November\nof 2011.  Her previous jobs did not provide medical insurance, and she incurred some medical debts. \nIn 2007, Applicant and her ex-husband filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection because they could\nnot afford to pay their mortgage.  The bankruptcy action discharged about $270,000 worth of debt. \nSubsequently, Applicant\u2019s husband left her, and the couple divorced.  Applicant sold the marital\nhome, purchased in 2010, in a short-sale.  Applicant\u2019s current husband is retired military and has\nadvised her on resolving her financial problems.  She testified that she prepared a spreadsheet to\ndemonstrate her efforts at debt resolution, but she did not submit it to the Judge as she had promised\nto do.\nThe Judge found that some of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts had been resolved.  However, he\nentered adverse findings in regard to four debts.  One was a delinquent automobile loan in the\namount of over $10,000, charged off in 2014.  This was a debt jointly incurred between Applicant\nand her ex-husband.  In her interview, Applicant stated that she would resolve this debt after she had\ntaken care of smaller ones.  She testified at the hearing that the creditor offered to settle the debt for\n$8,000, but she could not afford to pay that amount.  Applicant did not provide documentary\nevidence of this settlement offer.  In her post-hearing submission, she asserted that the creditor told\nher that it would not seek to enforce this debt, as it was beyond the statute of limitations.  She did\nnot corroborate this matter.  \nThe other debts that the Judge resolved adversely to Applicant were for medical expenses. \nOne of these was for eye surgery in late 2014, the total amount of which was almost $3,000. \nAlthough Applicant promised to make regular payments, she had made none as of the close of the\nrecord.  Applicant settled and/or paid the remaining two medical debts after she received the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is about $96,000, and her husband\u2019s is about $104,000 plus an\nunspecified amount in military retirement pay.  Her husband makes child support payments from\n2\n\nan earlier marriage and is jointly liable for payments on a previous residence.  Applicant stated that\nshe did not contact her creditors until recently because she did not have enough income to make\npayments on her debts.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nAs noted, the Judge resolved some debts in Applicant\u2019s favor.  As regards those underlying\nhis adverse decision, he acknowledged circumstances outside Applicant\u2019s control that affected her\nfinancial problems.  However, he concluded that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible action\nin regard to her debts.  The Judge noted, for example, that Applicant had made payments for a while\non the delinquent automobile loan but stopped doing so well before her period of unemployment. \nShe did not corroborate her testimony about negotiations with the creditor, nor did she demonstrate\nexpeditious resolution of her medical debts.  The Judge stated that Applicant demonstrated no\nfinancial counseling other than that required for bankruptcy filing and concluded that her debts are\nnot under control.  The Judge found that Applicant submitted a plan for resolving the laser surgery\ndebt but that she had made no payments by the close of the record.  Overall, he concluded that\nApplicant had not demonstrated a track record of debt payment sufficient to mitigate all of the\nconcerns alleged against her.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief includes matters outside the record.  These include documents that post-\ndate the Judge\u2019s decision.  We are not permitted to consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29.1  Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contained errors, for example his\nfindings about her purported reliance on the statute of limitations for resolution of the automobile\nloan, the extent to which her financial problems originated with her ex-husband, etc.  We have\nexamined the Judge\u2019s findings in light of the record as a whole.  The Judge\u2019s material findings are\nsupported by substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the\nevidence.  Applicant\u2019s brief cites to no error in the Judge\u2019s findings that would likely have affected\nthe outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 17-00260 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 25, 2018). \nFurthermore, the non-collectability of a debt does not inhibit a Judge from considering the\ncircumstances of an applicant\u2019s delinquencies.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 (App. Bd.\nSep. 19, 2008). \nMany of Applicant\u2019s arguments constitute a challenge to the manner in which the Judge\nweighed the evidence.  However, an ability to argue for an alternative interpretation of the record\nis not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\n1The new evidence pertains to the resolution of debts after the Judge issued his decision.  Even if this were\nevidence that we could consider, it would not refute a principal feature of the Judge\u2019s analysis regarding the timing of\nApplicant\u2019s efforts at debt payment.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 16-03595 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 27, 2018).  Access to\nprotected information requires faithful adherence to the rules and regulations governing such activity.  A person who\nbegins to address concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her access is in jeopardy may lack the\nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not at stake.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018).   \n3\n\ncapricious, or contrary to law.

The standard applicable to trustworthiness\ncases is that set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) regarding\nsecurity clearances:  such a determination \u201cmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the\ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d See, e.g., ADP Case No. 17-03252 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nAs amended, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax\nreturns for 2011 through 2016 in a timely manner.  The Judge found against Applicant on the two\nSOR allegations.  She concluded that \u201cApplicant\u2019s pattern of failing to timely file his Federal and\nstate tax returns is recent and raises concerns about his willingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nand his current reliability and judgment.\u201d  Decision at 9.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief includes information not contained in the record.  We cannot\nconsider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant indicated that he did not recall the discussion at the hearing or\nin the summary of his background interview that his late tax filings started in 2011.  He further states\nthat his late filings started with his 2001 tax returns following his wife\u2019s car accident.  From our\nreading of his brief, it is unclear what point Applicant is trying to make regarding his 2011 tax\nreturns.  We note, however, that Applicant admitted at the hearing that he failed to file his 2011\nFederal and state tax returns in a timely manner.  Tr. 12-17, 21, 68-69, and 78-79.  \nThe main thrust of Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is that he provides a valuable contribution to\nnational security.  In the past, the Appeal Board has noted an applicant\u2019s contributions to national\nsecurity are not relevant or material in assessing his or her security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 02-11570 at 8 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  To the extent that Applicant is requesting a waiver of\nthe security concerns under Directive, Encl. 2, App. C, he has not shown that such an exception is\nmerited.  On this matter, we note the lack of persuasive evidence that explains \u201cthe benefit of\n[Applicant\u2019s] . . . continued eligibility clearly outweighs any security concerns.\u201d  Id.   \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n20, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn December 20, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant has been employed by a Defense contractor since October 2013.  He experienced\nunemployment from September 2012 until he assumed his current duties.  He held a clearance from\n2002 until 2007.  Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges numerous delinquent debts.  The ones at issue in this\nappeal are student loans.  Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in September 2016,\nand his debts were discharged the following January.  All of his SOR debts were covered by the\nbankruptcy discharge, except for the student loans.  Applicant entered into a repayment plan for\nthem in October 2017.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his having lived beyond his means and to his\nunemployment.  His irresponsible spending led to judgments being levied against him.  The Judge\nconcluded that the receipt of the SOR precipitated Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy filing.  Applicant\nprovided no current budget.  He has no track record of payment on the student loans, nor did he\nsubmit character references, his work record, or evidence of community involvement.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing and did not result from\ncircumstances outside his control, given his admission of irresponsible spending.  However, he also\nstated that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are unlikely to recur.  The Judge noted that Applicant\nadmitted to his interviewer in 2015 that his student loans would not be discharged but did not\narrange a payment plan until after the hearing.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief includes information not contained in the record.  We cannot consider new\nevidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant notes the Judge\u2019s comment that he did not\nprovide character evidence.  He points out that his mother appeared at the hearing and testified that\nhe is trustworthy.  We conclude that this error is harmless, in that it did not likely affect the outcome\nof the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.17-01181 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 2018).  \nApplicant cites to his prior belief that his student loans were covered by bankruptcy.  He\nstates that he set up a payment plan as soon as he discovered otherwise and that the timing of his\nbankruptcy filing after receipt of the SOR was merely coincidental.  He also cites to the Judge\u2019s\n2\n\nconclusion that his problems are unlikely to recur.  On this last point, the mitigating condition in\nquestion also requires that the financial circumstances do not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(a).  The Judge did\nnot make a finding that this criterion had been satisfied.  All in all, Applicant has not shown that the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).  \nApplicant notes that the Judge\u2019s decision was issued long after the hearing.   Applicant has\nnot shown how this delay caused the Judge to commit a factual or legal error based on the record\nthat was before him.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-09421 at 3 (App. Bd.

Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis  \nApplicant, who is 46 years old, has been working for a defense contractor since 2013.  While\nexperiencing some gaps in employment, she has been working for defense contractors since 1992. \nShe was granted a security clearance in 2007.\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2005 and had\n12 delinquent debts totaling about $12,000.  On her 2014 security clearance application (SCA), she\nfailed to list her delinquent debts and disclose criminal arrests and citations.  She documented no\nefforts to address her debts.  She attributed her bankruptcy to her divorce in 1997, but this is\nattenuated.  She provided no character references or documentation of financial counseling. \nIn a footnote, the Judge noted that Applicant thought the SCA question pertaining to felony\ncharges applied only to those occurring within the last seven years.  While she provided no\ncorroboration for her claim to have disclosed the felony charge to an investigator in 2007, the age\nof the criminal charge in question (occurring nearly 25 years before her SCA submission) renders\nthe allegation of little security significance.  Her explanations for omissions of her financial\nproblems and other criminal charges are less credible. \nApplicant has an extensive history of financial problems and did not provide documentation\nof efforts to resolve those problems.  Similarly, the Government established cases for\ndisqualification under Guidelines J and E.  Her SOR response does not contain a thorough\nexplanation for her criminal conduct or SCA omissions.\nDiscussion\nRegarding the falsification allegations, Applicant contends that her SCA omissions were not\ndeliberate.  For example, she claims she had no clue what was on her credit report until she was\ninterviewed by an investigator.  We note that Applicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s\nspecific findings of fact pertaining to the falsification allegations.  It also merits noting that \ncircumstantial evidence may establish an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the alleged\nfalsification occurred.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01077 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 25, 2018).  From our review\nof the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings about the falsification allegations are based on\nsubstantial record evidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn\nfrom the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).  Applicant\nfailed to establish that the Judge erred in concluding that she falsified her SCA. \nApplicant has provided detailed explanations pertaining to her financial problems and\ncriminal charges.  These arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judges weighing of the\nevidence and are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30,\n2018).  \nApplicant has also provided us with contact information for her doctor, supervisors, and\nother character references.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 27, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On April 11, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Francisco Mendez granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn August 23, 2018, we remanded the case to correct an identified error.  On November 28,\n2018, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive.\nApplicant has raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nNote:  The basis for the remand was to clarify the status of Government Exhibit (GE) 2,\nAnswers to Interrogatories, that included a summary of Applicant\u2019s clearance interview.  The prior\nJudge had admitted this document into evidence, though he noted Applicant\u2019s claim that parts of it\nwere not accurate.  The Judge gave the parties an opportunity after the hearing to submit additional\nevidence or argument concerning this exhibit, though neither did.  The Judge made no additional\nfindings or rulings regarding it.\nIn considering Department Counsel\u2019s appeal of the prior Judge\u2019s favorable holding, we were\nnot able to conclude from the record that was before us what parts of the interview description\nApplicant had adopted or had not adopted.  That is, we were \u201cunable to discern whether key\nstatements were admitted into, or excluded from, evidence.\u201d  Decision at 2.  Accordingly, we\nremanded the case for further processing.  During the hearing on remand, the Judge stated that he\nwould consider the evidence admitted at the prior hearing, including the transcript.  He stated that\nthe remand hearing would focus upon the admissibility of GE 2.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has worked for Federal contractors for more than thirty years and has held a\nclearance since 1970.  He served on active duty with the U.S. military from 1970 to 1975.  He holds\na doctoral degree.  Married and divorced twice, he has five children.  \nAt the remand hearing, Department Counsel called the investigator who had prepared the\ninterview description contained in GE 2.  This person testified about her training and experience and\nthe methods that she employs when questioning applicants and memorializing their answers. \nSpecifically, she testified that she wrote down an applicant\u2019s answers using whatever words the\napplicant had used and did not paraphrase them.  Although she admitted that she did not remember\nthe details of Applicant\u2019s interview, she testified as to her confidence that the interview description\nwas a 100% accurate presentation of Applicant\u2019s answers.  The Judge concluded that this witness\nhad authenticated the GE 2, and he admitted it into evidence. \n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s findings of security concern were drawn substantially from GE 2.  In essence,\nApplicant had a relationship with a foreign woman who appeared in pornographic videos.  \nApplicant had joined a fan club through which he could watch these pornographic videos.  The\nwoman led Applicant to understand that she would have sex with him, and on about five occasions\nhe paid her $1,200 for sex.  He traveled to different cities for that purpose and would usually meet\nher for dinner, followed by engaging in sexual activity in a hotel room.  He also invited her to a\nvacation home that he owned, asking his daughter, who was staying at the home, to leave for a few\nhours so that he could be alone with the woman.  He characterized himself as her customer and\nfriend.  Applicant admitted that he knew that prostitution was illegal.\n \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge found that the interviewer\u2019s testimony authenticating GE 2 resolved the issue that\nwas the reason for the remand.  He also stated that, although he was not convinced that GE 2 was\n100% accurate, neither was he convinced that the contents of the description regarding the woman\nwere a fabrication, as Applicant claimed.  The Judge noted the presumption that Government\nofficials discharge their duties in good faith and found no reason to deny the good faith of the\nauthenticating witness.  In examining Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, the Judge concluded that the\nconduct in question was recent, frequent, and not unlikely to recur.  He did note that the conduct\ntook place in private and that it was consensual.  However, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s\nconduct impugned his judgment, and he entered adverse formal findings under both Guidelines.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in holding against him.  He contends that GE 2 was\nneither substantiated nor corroborated, as required by case law.  He argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse\nfindings and conclusions constituted an improper substitution of a credibility determination for\nactual evidence.\nWe examine a Judge\u2019s decision to admit evidence to see if it is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g,. ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017).  Because GE 2\nwas drawn from a DoD background report of investigation (ROI), the Judge properly evaluated its\nadmissibility under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20.  This paragraph states, in pertinent part, as follows:\nOfficial records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course of business,\nother than [a] DoD [ROI], may be received and considered by the Administrative\nJudge without authenticating witnesses . . . An ROI may be received with an\nauthenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules\nof Evidence[.] \nIn this case, as the Judge noted, the official who conducted Applicant\u2019s interview and prepared the\ninterview summary contained in GE 2 satisfied the authentication requirement of \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n3\n\nMoreover, GE 2 meets the second prong of \u00b6 E3.1.20 because it is admissible as evidence of\nstatements by a party opponent in accordance with FRE 801(d) or, in the alternative, is admissible\nas a record of a regularly recurring activity\u2013in this case a security clearance investigation\u2013under\nFRE 803(6).  The Judge\u2019s decision to admit GE 2 was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant appears to argue that, insofar as he denied the truthfulness of GE 2, the\nGovernment was required to provide independent corroborating evidence of the facts stated therein\nas a condition of admissibility.  He cites to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and its requirement of an\nauthenticating witness, and we construe the argument to mean that the Government was required to\npresent a witness who could not merely authenticate, or identify, GE 2 but independently\ncorroborate the matters asserted therein before the Judge could consider the exhibit.  However, as\nour discussion above attests, authentication is simply a means whereby the proponent of evidence\nestablishes that the evidence is what it purports to be, in this case a record of Applicant\u2019s clearance\ninterview.  See FRE 901for a discussion of authentication as a condition precedent to admissibility.1 \nThe Directive does not require independent substantive corroboration of the facts asserted within\nan interview description or similar document.  Once a DoD ROI is authenticated and found\nadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a Judge may consider it for the truth of the matter\nasserted, even if there is no other evidence of those matters.  Applicant cites to numerous Appeal\nBoard cases in his brief.  However, these cases address the admissibility of interview descriptions\nwhen there has been no authenticating witness, for example when the applicant waives an objection\nto the evidence (ISCR Case No. 15-01807 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2017)) or when the applicant admits\nthat the report accurately depicts his answers (ISCR Case No. 09-06218 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2011)). \nNone of these cases establish a requirement that even when a witness has authenticated an interview\ndescription within the meaning of the Directive, the Government must still present independent\nevidence of its assertions before it can be admitted and considered over an applicant\u2019s objection.2 \n To the extent Applicant is disagreeing with the weight the Judge gave to the evidence or is\ndisagreeing with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, such disagreements are not sufficient to demonstrate that\nthe Judge erred.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00310 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018).\n1FRE 901(a) provides that the \u201crequirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to\nadmissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent\nclaims.\u201d  Authentication simply means that it is authored by, or issued by, or has its source in, what or who is claimed. \nIt does not, in and of itself, mean that factual statements in the document must be accepted as true.  For this the document\nmust be evaluated for admissibility as a hearsay exception, etc.  See Rothstein, Practice Comment to 901(a), Federal\nRules of Evidence, Third Edition (2008).\n2 We also note Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge\u2019s decision was based upon non-alleged conduct.  However,\nnon-alleged conduct means conduct that is not alleged in the SOR, which denies the applicant fair notice of the concerns\nto be addressed in the DOHA proceeding.  Applicant\u2019s conduct was indeed alleged in the SOR, and the Government\u2019s\nevidence, including the properly admitted GE 2, constitutes substantial evidence of the allegations.  The Judge\u2019s material\nfindings are supported by substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02640 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).\n4\n\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nDecember 5, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecisionCsecurity concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 6, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied Applicant=s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive && E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge=s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge=s favorable findings under Guidelines D, J, and\nE were not raised as an issue on appeal and are not addressed further below.1  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm.\nThe Judge=s Pertinent Findings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He honorably served in the\nmilitary and has held a security clearance in the past.  The SOR alleged ten delinquent debts totaling\nover $24,000.  The Judge found against Applicant on six delinquent student loans and for him on\nthe other debts, including a duplicate student loan allegation. \nCredit reports in evidence established the student loans in question.  The Judge noted that\nthe student loans are difficult to track through credit reports because of the way they were \u201cissued,\ndefaulted, consolidated, and rehabilitated, seldom with the same account numbers attached to the\naccounts.@  Decision at 3.  Two of the alleged student loans (SOR && 4.h and 4.i) were paid after\nthe issuance of the SOR.  While some of Applicant=s other student loans were also resolved after\nissuance of the SOR, the payment documentation provided either did not have account numbers or\nthe listed account numbers did not match those of the alleged debts. \nApplicant attributed the delinquent student loans to not understanding the interplay between\nthe military tuition assistance program, his grants, and his loans.  He acknowledged receiving\ndunning letters from student loan creditors beginning in 2011.  He disputed the student loans with\nthe credit bureaus, but no changes were made.  He produced little to show his efforts to resolve the\nstudent loans before the SOR was issued.  He provided character reference letters that describe him\nas honest and trustworthy.  \nThe Judge=s Pertinent Analysis\nApplicant accumulated delinquent student loans and largely ignored them before the SOR\n1 In the formal findings, the Judge found for Applicant on Guideline D and against him on its subparagraphs, i.e., SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  Applicant\u2019s counsel contends that, based on a reading of the decision, the Judge\u2019s formal findings\nconcerning those subparagraphs were a typographical error.  We agree.  See, e.g., DISCR OSD Case No. 91-1449 at 3,\nn.2 (App. Bd. Apr. 26 1993) (In addressing an inconsistency in the formal findings, we read a Judge\u2019s decision in its\nentirety to discern his or her meaning.).\n2\n\nwas issued. These delinquencies are recent, frequent, and were not incurred under unusual\ncircumstances.  By 2011, he was aware that his military tuition assistance did not cover the loans. \nThereafter, he did not act responsibly in addressing these debts until he received the SOR.  He failed\nto document his efforts to deal with the creditors after becoming aware of the defaulted loans.  \nApplicant has made a number of payments to resolve student loans that may or may not\ncorrelate to those alleged in the SOR.  Even if he made those payments on the alleged student loans,\nhe did not undertake such efforts until after he received the SOR.  Such belated efforts do not\nmitigate the security concerns arising from the alleged student loans. \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that he resolved each of the student loans that the Judge found against\nhim.  In doing so, he cites to his exhibits that the Judge indicated were difficult to decipher.  Based\non our review of the record, the Board concludes that the Judge=s material findings regarding the\nstudent loan debts are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or\ninferences that could be drawn from the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJul. 25, 2014). In this regard, we note the principle feature of the Judge=s analysis is not that\nApplicant failed to take action to resolve the student loans, but rather that he failed to take action\nto resolve them in a timely manner.  Access to protected information requires faithful adherence to\nthe rules and regulations governing such activity.  A person who begins to address concerns only\nafter having been placed on notice that his or her access is in jeopardy may lack the willingness to\nfollow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not at stake.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018).\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence,  mis-weighed\nthe evidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  For\nexample, he argues that he resolved the alleged student loans, that he was the victim of predatory\nlending practices, and that the delinquencies were the result of his confusion regarding their status. \nHowever, Applicant=s arguments are neither sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor are they enough to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-02488 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).2  We give due consideration to the Hearing Office case\nthat Applicant has cited, but it is neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to\nundermine the Judge=s decision.  Id. at 3-4.  Additionally, the Judge complied with the requirements\nof the Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering the totality of the evidence in reaching\nhis decision. \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\n2 Applicant cites to an assertion he made in his response to the SOR which could lead to the conclusion that he was a\nvictim of predatory lending practices.  There is no corroboration for the assertion.  Also, there is no detailed explanation\nas to how much of his delinquent debt can reasonably be attributed to the alleged predatory lending practices. \n3\n\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 12, 2019, after the\nhearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Elizabeth M.\nMatchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her findings of\nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant is 40 years old.  He has been working for his current employer since 2004 and was\ngranted a security clearance in 2005.  His security clearance was suspended in 2013 following his\narrest on sexual assault charges involving his stepdaughter.  He married in 2006, separated from his\nwife following the arrest, and divorced in 2017.\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested in early 2013 on three counts\nof rape of a child and one count of witness intimidation (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he was indicted later\nin 2013 on four counts of aggravated rape of a child, six counts of indecent assault and battery on\na child under age 14, one count of assault and battery with intent to rape, and one count of assault\nand battery by means of a dangerous weapon (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  The allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b\nare duplicative.  Both of those allegations were cross-alleged under Guidelines D and E.  Under\nGuideline E, the SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to report his arrest to his facility security\nofficer (FSO) in a timely manner and that he lied on his security clearance application (SCA) and\nduring his background interview in 2015 by stating he was falsely accused of the criminal\nallegations.1  \nIn 2013, Applicant\u2019s then 12-year-old stepdaughter told her mother that Applicant had\nsexually assaulted her on multiple occasions.  She described the incidents and indicated that\nApplicant threatened to beat her with a belt if she told anyone of the assaults.  The police were\nnotified and arrested Applicant, who remained in custody for a week.  The police record reveals that\nthe stepdaughter had also told a 13-year-old friend of the assaults.  \nApplicant notified his security office of the arrest and charges about four months following\nthe arrest and about three weeks after the indictment.  The security office submitted an adverse\n1 In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he was arrested and indicted on the alleged charges but\nclaimed those charges were based on false accusations.  He admitted that he did not report his arrest to his FSO in a\ntimely manner and denied the two falsification allegations. \n2\n\ninformation report that indicated Applicant did not report the exact charges and also stated that he\ndid not report the matter sooner because he was scared. At the security clearance hearing, he\nindicated that he understood he was required to report the arrest when it happened but attributed the\ndelay to being stressed and being focused on taking care of his family. \nApplicant pled not guilty to the charges.  The State filed with the court a Statement of the\nCase that summarized the facts, which indicated the alleged conduct progressed from initially\nfondling the stepdaughter when she was nine years old to eventually rape.  The attorney who\nrepresented Applicant in the criminal proceeding indicated that Applicant rejected plea bargain\noffers, and there was no scientific evidence linking Applicant to the crimes.  In early 2015, the State\nmoved to nolle prosequi the charges because it did not believe that it could meet its burden of proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt at trial.  \u201cIn addition, the state did not believe it was in the victim\u2019s best\ninterest to proceed at that time.\u201d  Decision at 4, citing Government Exhibit (GE) 5.  \nIn his 2015 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant reported that he was falsely\naccused of the sexual assault charges.  In a 2016 background interview, he denied ever touching\nchildren inappropriately and indicated that the charges against him were false.  When asked about\nthe delay in reporting his arrest during the interview, he indicated he was trying to get his personal\nlife in order.  \nIn responding to interrogatories, Applicant indicated that he has a healthy co-parenting plan\nwith his ex-wife.  At the hearing, he stated that he has unsupervised weekly contact with his two\nchildren.  He has no visitation rights with the stepdaughter.  He provided no reason for why his\nstepdaughter would falsely accuse him.  He provided annual performance evaluations that praise his\nwork performance.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n\u201cThe indictment indicates the grand jury believed Applicant committed felonious sexual\nassaults on his stepdaughter between 2009 and . . . [2013] and that he threatened to assault her if she\ntold anyone about the assaults. . . .  The evidentiary standard for a grand jury indictment is probable\ncause to believe the defendant committed the offense. . . .  In the state at issue, probable cause\nrequires more than mere suspicion but something less than evidence sufficient to warrant a\nconviction.\u201d  Decision at 8.  \u201cThe Government\u2019s evidence includes police reports containing\ncontemporaneous summaries of interviews of Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and close friend of Applicant\u2019s\nstepdaughter about the sexual assaults as detailed to them by Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter. . . .  There\nis no apparent motive for either of them to have made false statements to the police about what they\nwere told.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThere is no statement in evidence from Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter, but the grand jury\nindictment and the statements to the police from her mother and friend constitute probative, reliable\n3\n\nevidence that may be considered in these proceedings, and together raise security concerns under\n[Adjudicative Guideline] \u00b6 31(b).\u201d2  Id. at 9. \nThe decision of the prosecutor to dismiss the charges was based on the best interests of the\nstepdaughter and because the State did not think it could prove the charges beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.  That decision is not a finding of no culpability.  \nApplicant demonstrated a lack of candor about the criminal charges during his security\nclearance adjudication, which diminishes the credibility of his denials of committing the alleged sex\ncrimes.   He under-reported the extent of the criminal charges against him to his security office, on\nhis 2015 SCA, and during his background interview.  \u201cHis denials of any inappropriate behavior\nwith his stepdaughter lack credibility.\u201d  Decision at 10.   \nApplicant did not comply with his obligation to report his arrest to security officials in a\ntimely manner.  Sufficient evidence exists to conclude that Applicant lied when he claimed he was\nfalsely accused of the criminal sex offenses in his SCA and background interview.  His minimization\nof his charges on those occasions, which was not specifically alleged and cannot be considered as\na disqualifying factor, shows a lack of reform and reliability.  Although more than five years have\npassed since the sex crimes, he has not yet shown he can be counted on to comply with reporting\nrequirements.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on one Guideline J allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and\nagainst him on the remaining allegations.\nDiscussion\nRegarding the criminal conduct allegations, Applicant\u2019s Counsel contends that the entire case\nagainst his client is based on hearsay.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel notes the record neither contains a\nstatement from the stepdaughter about the alleged sexual assaults nor a report of a physical\nexamination performed on her.  He argues that the record lacks credible and substantive evidence\nand the burden of production was improperly shifted to him during the proceeding.  He further\nasserts that the Judge\u2019s findings based solely on hearsay do not comport with the Directive.  These \narguments are not persuasive.  In administrative proceedings, hearsay is admissible and can\nconstitute substantial evidence.  See, e.g., Crawford v. Dept. of Agriculture, 50 F. 3d 46, 49 (D.C.\nCir. 1995); Bustos-Torres v. INS, 898 F.2d 1053, 1056 (5th Cir. 1990); Willingham v. Gonzales, 391\nF. Supp. 2d 52, 64 (Dist. Ct. D.C., 2005), quoting Hoska v. Army, 677 F.2d 131, 138 (D.C. Cir.\n1982).  DOHA proceedings are administrative in nature, and they are not conducted with a strict\napplication of evidentiary rules required in criminal cases, although DOHA relies upon the Federal\nRules of Evidence (FRE) as a guide in its hearings.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n11-12461 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2013).  Public records admissible under FRE 803(8), such as court\nrecords and police reports, are presumed to be reliable by virtue of the government agency\u2019s duty for\n2 Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 31(b) states, \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an\nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged,\nprosecuted, or convicted[.]\u201d\n4\n\naccuracy and the high probability that it has satisfied that duty.3  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-07509\n5, n.3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2013), citing United States v. Carter, 591 F.3d 656, 659 (D.C. Cir. 2010). \nIn this case, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s reliance on hearsay documents in making her findings\nof fact or in reaching her conclusions.   \nApplicant Counsel also contends that Judge erred in her consideration of the State\u2019s decision\nto nolle prosequi the charges.  In this regard, we note that the dropping or dismissal of criminal\ncharges does not preclude the Judge from finding an applicant engaged in the conduct underlying\nthose charges or from evaluating the applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n00506 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018) and ISCR Case No. 14-01763 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2015). \nIn his argument, Applicant Counsel states, \u201cThere is simply no evidence in this record to support the\ndetermination that the State\u2019s decision not to prosecute was due to considerations of \u2018best interests\u2019\nof the alleged victim.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 10.  On the other hand, he also notes that the State\u2019s nolle\nprosequi court filing, which was signed by the Assistant District Attorney, states, \u201cwe do not believe\nit is in the victim\u2019s best interest to proceed at this time.\u201d  GE 5 at 3.  He argues, \u201cWhile seemingly\nsplitting hairs, it is submitted that the wording is critical in that the inference is that the testimony\nof the alleged victim would not hold up against zealous cross examination; [p]erhaps due to multiple\nversion[s] of events.\u201d  In support of his claimed reasons for the dismissal of the charges, Applicant\u2019s\nCounsel cites to GE 2 and 5.  However, neither of those documents nor any other record evidence\nsupports the contention of Applicant\u2019s Counsel that the charges were dropped \u201cdue to  [the victim\u2019s]\nmultiple versions of events\u201d or because the \u201cvictim would not hold up against zealous cross-\nexamination.\u201d4  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s findings regarding the State\u2019s decision\nto dismiss the charges are based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that\ncould be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014). \nApplicant Counsel further challenges the Judge\u2019s reliance on the indictments as proof that\nhe engaged in criminal conduct and argues that \u201cPattern Jury Instructions warn jurors that an \n\u2018indictment is proof of nothing\u2019 and \u2018it does not even raise suspicion of guilt.\u2019\u201d5  Appeal Brief at 9. \nIn making his arguments, he also highlights a number of the unique aspects of grand jury\nproceedings.6  However, as noted above, DOHA proceedings are not required to comply with rules\n3 In DOHA proceedings, police reports are admissible both as official records under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and\nas public records under FRE 803(8).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02859 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2017).\n4 In referring to the nolle prosequi decision during his closing argument, Applicant\u2019s Counsel at the hearing\nstated, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the prosecutor used to reach that decision.\u201d  Tr. at 64.  The record of the proceeding was left\nopen for Applicant\u2019s Counsel to present an affidavit from the attorney who represented Applicant in the criminal\nproceeding.  That affidavit does not state a reason for the prosecutor\u2019s decision to dismiss the charges.  Applicant\u2018s\nExhibit F.\n5 The sample jury instructions are not contained in the record.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel neither requested that we\ntake administrative notice of the jury instructions nor provided a citation to those instructions.  \n6 The thrust of Applicant\u2019s Counsel arguments is that a prosecutor controls grand jury proceedings and little\nweight should be given to an indictment.   \n5\n\nor procedures that pertain to criminal prosecutions.  Jury instructions have no application in DOHA\nproceedings.  In this regard, we also note that Applicant has not specifically challenged the Judge\u2019s\nfinding that, in the state at issue, an indictment is a grand jury determination that probable cause\nexists to believe the defendant committed the offense.  Based on our review of the record,\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel has failed to show that the Judge erred in her consideration of the indictments. \nThe balance of the arguments of Applicant\u2019s Counsel amount to a challenge to the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis of the evidence.  He argues that the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence and \nmis-weighed the evidence.  His arguments, however, are neither enough to rebut the presumption\nthat the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed\nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nJanuary 4, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nAt the hearing, the Judge amended the SOR by adding another Guideline F allegation.  Tr. at 90-91.\nOn February 26, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nThe SOR, as amended, alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent debts totaling over\n$99,000.  It also alleged that he had three Chapter 13 bankruptcies dismissed between 1999 and\n2013, that he was granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2014, and that he filed Chapter 13\nbankruptcy in March 2018, which was pending approval of a plan.  The pending bankruptcy lists\ndebts \u2013 over $93,000 in an educational loan and nearly $9,000 in Federal and state taxes \u2013 that are\nlikely not dischargeable.  He paid three of the alleged debts after the SOR was issued.  He and his\nwife have been plagued with a series of automobile accidents, injuries, and illnesses.  They have\nincurred significant out-of-pocket expenses for medical treatments.  Applicant documented that he\nreceived financial counseling and provided character references attesting to his honesty and\ntrustworthiness.\n  \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on four bankruptcy allegations in the SOR and against\nhim on the remaining allegations, including the one involving the 2018 bankruptcy proceeding. \nApplicant did not address $4,000 in delinquent debts until after he received the SOR.  He began a\nrehabilitation plan for his $95,000 educational loan before issuance of the SOR but failed to submit\ninformation about the status of the loan after March 2017.  He encountered circumstances beyond\nhis control, and his filing of the latest bankruptcy petition can be considered reasonable under the\ncircumstances.  However, he falls short of showing progress on the pending bankruptcy.  His one\npayment on the still unapproved plan is insufficient to establish a favorable track record of payments. \nIt is too soon to conclude that his financial problems have been resolved or are under control. He has\nnot shown a good-faith effort to address his debts.      \n   \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s analysis of the evidence.  For example, he argues that his\nfinancial problems were due to conditions beyond his control and that he has acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances in his attempts to resolve those problems.  His arguments, however, are neither\nenough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient\nto show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  \nApplicant contends that the Judge applied guidelines to him that pertain to military personnel. \nIt appears that Applicant is making this contention based on the Judge\u2019s citation to Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988) in the decision.1  This contention does not raise any error. \n1 Egan is a U.S. Supreme Court decision that does not specifically address the granting or denial of security\nclearances to military personnel; however, it does generally address the Executive Branch\u2019s authority to grant or deny\nsecurity clearances.  \n2\n\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines used in this case apply to practically all individuals who require access\nto classified information, including DoD contractors.  See Directive, Encl. 2 \u00b6\u00b6 B, C, D.4, D.5, and\nD.8 that address the applicability of the Adjudicative Guidelines. \nApplicant argues that the Judge asked him more questions than Department Counsel.  To the\nextent that Applicant is claiming the Judge was not impartial, we did not find that argument\npersuasive.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party\nseeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n14-03108 at 3 (App. Bd. May 20, 2015).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge\nwas unbiased.2 \nApplicant asserts that he received a security clearance in 2002 that was renewed in 2013 and\nthat he should not have to renew it again until 2023.  He also notes that the Judge indicated the\nreason for the current background investigation is unclear.   To the extent that Applicant is arguing\nthat the Government was precluded from reevaluating his security clearance eligibility, we do not\nfind that argument persuasive.  A favorable security decision does not give an applicant the right to\nretain a security clearance regardless of subsequent events or changed circumstances.  The\nGovernment is not barred from issuing an adverse security clearance decision once it becomes aware\nof information that calls into question an applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a security clearance.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08806 at 4 (App. Bd. May 8, 2007). \nApplicant further argues that he should have a right to know any and all accusations against\nhim and the decision should be based on what actually happened as opposed to what could happen. \nIn making these arguments, he highlights that there is no proof that he engaged in any wrongdoing.\nThe SOR provided Applicant adequate notice of the Government\u2019s security concerns.3  Applicant\nhas not shown that he was denied any procedural due process rights afforded him under the\nDirective.  As the Appeal Board has previously stated, security clearance decisions are not an exact\nscience, but rather involve predictive judgments about an applicant\u2019s security eligibility in light of\nthe applicant\u2019s past conduct and present circumstances.  The Federal Government need not wait until\nan applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke\n2 We note the things that our colleague has addressed in his separate opinion and agree that the Judge could have\nspoken more temperately at times.  We do not believe that the matters raised in the separate opinion are sufficient to rebut\nthe presumption that the Judge was impartial.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02391 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018). \nMoreover, the Judge provided Applicant with an opportunity to present additional evidence, including an affidavit from\nhis wife, which significantly diminishes any harm that might otherwise have come about due to the ruling addressed in\nthe separate opinion. \n3 After the Judge indicated on the record the SOR amendment, Applicant\u2019s Counsel stated, \u201cI have no heartburn\nwith that amendment, but I do think that I should have the -- if Your Honor is going to give weight to various debts listed\nin that bankruptcy, that we were not put on notice of, then I should have an opportunity to address those specific\nallegations in a proper response to the SOR.\u201d   Tr. at 91.  In this regard, we note that it was Applicant who introduced\ninto evidence that he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2018.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) I and Tr. at 54-56. We also\nnote that, as mentioned in the previous footnote, Applicant was also provided an opportunity to submit post-hearing\nmatters, including matters about the debts in the bankruptcy and an affidavit from his wife.  AE M (1-15).    \n3\n\naccess to classified information based on an applicant\u2019s conduct or circumstances that raise security\nconcerns even in the absence of security violations.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-09966 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jun. 25, 2008).  A history of financial difficulties raises security concerns.  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6\u00b6 18 and 19.  Guideline F security concerns are broader than the possibility that an applicant\nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money to satisfy his or her\ndebts.  Those concerns also encompass the risk that applicants who are financially irresponsible\nmight also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  In this case,\nApplicant has failed to show that the Judge erred in his analysis of the record evidence under\nGuideline F.  \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Egan at 528.  See also\nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national\nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSee Dissenting Opinion              \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

RA\u2019ANAN\nApplicant\u2019s brief raises the issue of bias: \u201c...it also seems that the decision had already been\nmade.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s brief at page 3.  In reviewing the transcript of the hearing for evidence of bias\n(or absence thereof), I noted several instances of seemingly hostile demeanor or  arbitrary rulings by\nthe Judge against either Applicant, Applicant\u2019s wife, or Applicant\u2019s attorney, a former DOHA\nofficial.  The attorney is not representing Applicant on appeal.  Cumulatively, these episodes support\na concern as to whether the Judge was biased or could reasonably be perceived as such.\nApplicant\u2019s wife has been in multiple accidents and had multiple surgeries and\nhospitalizations over several decades.  Furthermore, she is a cancer survivor.  She attended the\nHearing in a wheelchair.  Her testimony regarding her medical history and the attendant billing was\nintegral to Applicant\u2019s case.  On pages 9-10 of the transcript, Applicant\u2019s attorney moved to have\nthe wife testify first and not sequester her. The Judge responded to the motion as follows \u201cWell,\nbecause, [Applicant\u2019s attorney] we get to go through whether or not there are any procedural issues\nin the case in which case there will be issues discussed on the record that the witness doesn\u2019t need\nto hear, so it is appropriate.  So we\u2019re off the record.  Please make whatever arrangements you need\nto do to have [Applicant\u2019s wife] rest comfortably while we finish the rest of the preliminary stuff and\nwe begin the hearing, at which point you may then call her first, at which point after she has testified,\nbecause this hearing is open, she may remain in the hearing room.  We\u2019re off the record.  Thank\nyou.\u201d  At that point they went off the record for one hour and one minute.  When the proceedings\nresumed neither party had any procedural issues to address.\nAfter Applicant wife testified, the Judge said to her \u201cThank you for giving us your time here\nthis morning.  You are free to wheel yourself to the back of the hearing room and remain, as long\nas it takes.\u201d  Transcript pp. 47-48.  Note that the attorney had made no motion to have her stay in the\nroom, indeed, he never spoke at all, at that juncture.  On page 82, while Applicant is testifying, the\nJudge says \u201cYes $683 to [a bank] $312 to [another bank] $1,489 to [a third bank].  So with the\nalleged [cable tv company]\u2013I\u2019m sorry [Applicant\u2019s wife], you\u2019ve testified, and you\u2019re done.  I\u2019m\nsorry.  That\u2019s how it works.\u201d. . . .  On page 86, Applicant\u2019s attorney asked \u201cYour Honor, may I\nconsult for a moment in the hall with [Applicant\u2019s wife] to find out what\u2019s on her mind, and\ndetermine whether to ask you to allow--\u201d The Judge said \u201cNo, you may not.  It\u2019s the risk you run. \nShe stayed in the room.  She\u2019s heard the testimony now.  She had her chance to testify, and that was\npart of the reason for putting her on.  You will have an opportunity here to augment the record before\nI get done with this.  But you may not put [Applicant\u2019s wife] back on the stand.  Any more evidence\nfrom you?\u201d \nOn page 89, the Judge was discussing items that might be submitted after the hearing, the\nattorney interjected a question and the Judge said \u201cAnything else, I\u2019m just listing the things that\ncause me heartburn.  If there are things that you think will be helpful to your client, by all means,\nsubmit them, as long as its done by the close of business on the 27th.  I do note in making the offer\nthat the Applicant has had the SOR for more than a year.\u201d\n5\n\nOn page 90, the Judge (properly) decided to amend the SOR to include a bankruptcy that had\nnot been part of the SOR before.  At that point, Applicant\u2019s attorney asked for a written amendment\nto the SOR and an opportunity to respond to the amendment, at which point the Judge said, \u201cMotion\ndenied.  I\u2019m amending the SOR to allege that on or about March 9, 2018, the Applicant filed a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition as encapsulated in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I. . . .\u201d  After further\ndiscussion the Judge again denied the motion on page 92.  No written amendment was put in the\nrecord.\nThe Judge\u2019s  ruling against providing the SOR amendment in writing to Applicant\u2019s attorney\nand against providing time for a response run against the spirit if not the plain language of the second\nsentence of Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17: When such amendments are made, the Administrative Judge may\ngrant either party\u2019s request for such additional time as the Administrative Judge may deem\nappropriate for further preparation or other good cause.\nThe Judge\u2019s approach to sequestering Applicant\u2019s wife, instructing her to \u201cwheel yourself\nback to the back of the hearing room and remain, as long as it takes[ ,]\u201d later prohibiting her from\noffering additional testimony, then prohibiting the attorney from finding out what she wanted to\naddress, and his implying, contrary to the record, that it was the attorney\u2019s decision to have her stay\nin the room are deeply troubling.  Proceedings at DOHA are subject to reasonable rules and\nprocedures.  However some flexibility is often accorded persons with disabilities or special needs. \nIn isolation none of the Judge\u2019s pertinent rulings or comments might have been worthy of note, in\ncombination they smack of either bias or the arbitrary wielding of authority.\nCumulatively, the issues I have noted justify remand to another Judge.  Especially since\nApplicant and his wife have had an usually rough medical history and concomitant financial\ndifficulties.  It is quite plausible that another Judge would analyze this record differently.\nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan               \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\n6\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJudd G. Millman, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 14, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 24, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  She has held a security\nclearance for about 28 years.   The SOR alleged seven delinquent debts totaling about $24,900.  She\nprimarily attributed the delinquent debts to a geographic move associated with a military base\nclosure and to fluctuations in her earnings.  She also experienced medical problems that resulted in\nhospitalizations. \n \nApplicant negotiated a settlement of a delinquent car loan for a repossessed vehicle.  Under\nthat settlement, she made regular monthly payment of $175 from early 2016 to mid 2018.  However,\nshe failed to present sufficient documentation to establish that she has resolved or is resolving the\nother delinquent debts.  She acted responsibly towards the delinquent car loan, but not the other\ndebts.  \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  In fact, some of those documents post-date the Judge\u2019s decision.  We cannot consider new\nevidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant contends  the Judge incorrectly stated that she has worked for different contractors. \nShe notes that she has worked for the same entity over the past 28 years, but it has changed names\nseveral times.  We conclude, however, this error was a harmless because it likely did not affect the\noutcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).   \nApplicant also contends the Judge incorrectly analyzed the evidence.  She argues the Judge\nconcluded \u201cthe record fails to establish that her debts are being resolved or under control  . . . [and]\ndoes not show a good-faith effort by Applicant to repay overdue creditors\u201d despite evidence that she\nhas \u201cmore than a two-year track record of regular payments.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 4, quoting from\nDecision at 7 and 8.   The above quotes, however, are unrelated.  By contrasting them, Applicant\nhas taken them out of their context.  The Judge\u2019s quote pertaining to the \u201ctwo-year track record of\n2\n\nregular payments\u201d addressed Applicant\u2019s effort to resolve the car loan.  The Judge found in favor\nof Applicant on the car loan.  The other quote pertaining to Applicant\u2019s failure to establish that the\n\u201cdebts are being resolved or are under control\u201d addressed the other debts for which the Judge\nconcluded insufficient corroborating documentation was presented.  Applicant\u2019s contention does not\nestablish any error in the Judge\u2019s analysis.  \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that she took inconsistent positions regarding\nthe debts that undermined her credibility and judgment.  The Judge, for example, noted that\nApplicant testified that she entered into an agreement with the creditor to start making $100 monthly\npayments on a delinquent vehicle lease in August 2018.  Tr. at 35-38.  In her post-hearing\nsubmissions between June and September 2018, Applicant presented no proof of the agreement or\npayments under it, but indicated that her attorney was trying to settle that debt.  Decision at 8.  From\nour review of the record, the Judge\u2019s conclusion about Applicant taking inconsistent positions about\nthe debts is based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Judge, however, did not conclude that the\ndisqualifying conditions pertaining to frivolous or irresponsible spending or unexplained affluence\napplied in this case.  Instead, the Judge concluded that Disqualifying Conditions 19(a), inability to\nsatisfy debts, and 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations, applied.  His conclusions\nregarding the application of Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) and 19(c) were based on substantial\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3.   \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  Those arguments, however, are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2016).\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

On\nMarch 29, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)  of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 17, 2018, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Philip J. Katauskas denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 37 year-old father of three children under the age of eleven.  \u201cFrom 2012 until\nMarch 2017, the mother had primary custody of Applicant\u2019s son and the mother\u2019s other two\nchildren, which were not Applicant\u2019s children.\u201d  Decision at 3- 4.  \u201cApplicant pays child support\nonly for his son, not the two other children the mother has from other fathers.\u201d  Decision at 4, fn.19. \nThe children\u2019s \u201cmother, pursuant to court order, has had primary custody since February, 22 2018.\u201d \nDecision at 4.  Applicant  was given physical custody of the three children at one point.  A college\ngraduate, he has been employed by defense contractors since 2014.  He has lived  with his girlfriend\nand her three children for almost five years.  His girlfriend does not receive child support for her\nthree children.  His girlfriend\u2019s oldest child has moved out of the home to attend college.  Applicant\nmakes about $130,000 per year and his girlfriend about makes $100,000 per year.  They divide the\nhousehold expenses equally.  His SOR lists twelve delinquent debts totaling just over $52,000. \nApplicant admitted to four debts and provided documentation showing he resolved three debts.  He\ndenied the remaining debt SOR allegations.  He denied the gambling SOR allegation and disputed\nhis delinquencies were due at least in part to his gambling.  Applicant attributed his financial\nproblems to his loss of employment and his child custody situation.\nThe Judge noted Applicant\u2019s unemployment and convoluted child custody situation led to\na substantial child support arrearage that was beyond his control.  He stated, that Applicant had\nfavorably addressed nine delinquent debts totaling just over $11,600, to include his child support\narrearage.  However, Applicant had not mitigated the remaining four SOR allegations which\nincluded three delinquencies totaling almost $40,000.  The Judge noted the roughly $7,000 to $8,000\nof annual gambling losses could have been more wisely spent reducing some of the SOR debts. \nDiscussion\nApplicant correctly notes the Judge erred in stating Applicant pays child support for one\nchild when he in fact paid child support for all three of his children.  The Judge aptly described the\ncircumstances that led to the child support arrearage as convoluted.  The Judge ultimately found\nApplicant\u2019s child support arrearage arose from conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control and that he\nhad acted responsibly under the circumstances given he \u201chad physical of custody of the three\nchildren\u201d while paying their expenses and child support at the same time.   Decision at 8.  The Judge\ncorrectly noted Applicant\u2019s testimony that his girlfriend did not receive child support for her three\n2\n\nchildren, two of whom were still residing with her.  Other than that, Applicant does not challenge\nthe Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  While the Judge erred in a finding of fact about the number of children\nApplicant supported, the error did not affect the outcome of the case.  We conclude, therefore, this\nidentified error was harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.15-04850 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2018). \nApplicant has not cited to a harmful error in the Judge\u2019s decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-\n02640 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence\nin a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02391\nat 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018).  \nApplicant\u2019s brief includes an assertion from outside the record pertaining to his exchange\nwith the Judge concerning a debt consolidation and counseling service.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn December 21, 2018, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is 40 years old, has been an employee of a defense contractor since 2001. \nShe has earned a master\u2019s degree.  Her annual salary is about $124,000.  Her work performance has\nbeen outstanding, and she has received numerous awards at work.  She is married.  Her husband\u2019s\nannual salary is about $45,000.  She has two children and a stepchild.  Her oldest child is a college\nstudent. \nApplicant experienced financial problems while raising a child as a single mother.  She did\nnot receive financial assistance from the child\u2019s father.  At that time, her student loans went into a\ndeferment status, and she did not know they were transferred to another company.  When she\nreceived letters from the company holding the loans, she thought they were solicitations to\nconsolidate the loans and did not respond to them.  In 2014, $1,200 of her monthly wages (more than\nher monthly mortgage payment) was involuntarily garnished to pay the student loans.  She was\nunsuccessful in her efforts to lower the garnishment.  While her wages were being garnished, she\nwas unable to pay other debts.  In late 2017, her student loan debt of $43,000 was paid completely\nthrough the garnishment.  Additionally, her mother passed away in 2017, and she paid the funeral\nexpenses.\n   \nBesides the resolved garnishment/student loans, the SOR alleged that Applicant had 26 other\ndelinquent accounts.  In her SOR response, she admitted all, but two, of the alleged debts.1  Her SOR\nresponse claimed she paid some of the debts and would pay others in late 2017, but provided no\ndocumentation of those payments.  She also asserted that she had a payoff plan to address 24\ndelinquent debts totaling about $40,200.  The payoff plan was to start three months after the hearing. \n1 In her SOR response, Applicant stated the debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.bb (two defaulted student loans) were\nduplicates of the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a (garnishment for student loans).  Applicant neither admitted nor denied the\nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.bb.\n2\n\nApplicant\u2019s credit report from early 2018 reflected she made some payments on a delinquent\ncredit card account.2  She also provided documentation showing she made five payments to creditors\ntotaling $180.  Additionally, when she learned her child\u2019s tuition was not fully funded, she stopped\nmaking payments to some of the alleged creditors.  \nAt some point, Applicant obtained the services of a credit correction company that sent\nletters disputing each of the SOR debts.  She had 34 negative accounts removed from her credit\nreport; however, there is no indication she made any payments on those accounts.  She also testified\nthat she had been \u201ckind of lackadaisical\u201d in paying off previous debts, but is aggressively trying to\nresolve the debts now that she is aware they affect her job.  Decision at 6, quoting from Tr. at 73. \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant experienced some conditions beyond her control.  An involuntary garnishment\nprevented her from making payments on other financial obligations.  She presented documentation\nof making only five payment totaling $180 towards the alleged debts after the garnishment ended\nin late 2017.  In her SOR response, she indicated that she had established certain repayment plans,\nbut nine months later provided no evidence that payments had been made under them.  Since the\ngarnishment, she has not acted responsibly in addressing her debts.  Numerous debts remain\nunresolved.  \nDiscussion    \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant states the Judge agreed to a proposed repayment plan at the\nhearing and notes that payments toward certain debts under that plan would start in May 2019.3  The\ntranscript does not support her contention that the Judge agreed to such a proposed plan.  Moreover,\nDOHA is not a debt collection agency, and DOHA Judges have no authority to approve an\napplicant\u2019s debt repayment plan.  In this case, the Judge correctly stated in his analysis that\nintentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other\nresponsible approaches, citing ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3, n.3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013).  \nAdditionally, Applicant argues she disputed certain debts that no longer appear on her credit report. \nIn the findings of fact, the Judge noted that Applicant admitted most of the alleged debts, but she\ndisputed all of them through a credit correction company, and provided no proof of payments on\nthose negative accounts.  In his analysis, the Judge correctly stated the Appeal Board has observed\nthat debts dropping off an applicant\u2019s credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution,\n2 The credit report reflected the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $528 was reduced to $297.  Decision at 5. \n3 Applicant appears to be referring to the Judge\u2019s discussion of leaving the record open for a period for her to\nsubmit additional documentation.  Tr. at 13-16.  While the discourse may have confused her, it did not constitute an\nagreement to any plan, especially since no plan had been presented.  \n3\n\nciting ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016).  As we previously stated, there may\nbe more than one plausible explanation for the absence of debts from a credit report, including the\npassage of time.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-05197 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2004).  Furthermore,\nApplicant indicates that she paid certain debts.  The Judge, however, concluded that she provided\ninsufficient proof of payments toward the alleged debts.  The Appeal Board has previously noted\nit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about the resolution of\nspecific debts.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016).  Applicant has not\nidentified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s analysis. \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  For example, she disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has shown\ninsufficient progress toward resolving the alleged debts.  These arguments, however, are not\nsufficient to show the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017).    \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

On\nAugust 22, 2018, DoD issued a superseding statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).1 \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On July 19, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his conclusion\nabout Applicant\u2019s conduct and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s found in favor of Applicant on all of the Guideline F allegations and\none Guideline E allegation.  Those favorable findings are not at issue on appeal.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is in her early 40s, is employed by a defense contractor overseas.  She served\nin the military for about four years and received an honorable discharge.  She is divorced with\nteenage children.  She has earned an associate\u2019s degree.    \nThe Judge found against Applicant on related SOR allegations.  These asserted that Applicant\nwas cited for prostitution and operating a business without a licence in 2017, that she engaged in sex\nwith strangers she met on websites, that her website posted she charged certain amounts of money\nfor specific periods of time, and that one man she met online paid her $80 following sex.  In\nresponding to the SOR, Applicant denied those allegations.   The Judge made the following findings:\nFor about one year from 2016 to 2017, Applicant\u2019s semi-nude photographs\nand contact information were placed on a dating or escort website. (Tr. 60-63, 68-70;\nGE 5)  Her time was available for $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for 60 minutes.  (Tr.\n61-63)  She offered conversation, warmth, massage, dance, and a special event to her\ncustomers.  (Tr. 61-62, 74)  In April 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued\na press release indicating the website Applicant was using to solicit customers was\n1 DoD initially issued the SOR on April 16, 2018.  \n2\n\nseized, as it was \u201cthe dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where\nsex traffickers frequently advertised children and adults alike.\u201d  (Tr. 77; GE 9).\nOn March 11, 2017, the police stopped a vehicle that had just left Applicant\u2019s\nresidence.  (GE 4) The driver was a soldier at a nearby military installation.  The\ndriver said he had just paid Applicant $80 for sex.  He said he also paid her $150 for\nsex on March 8, 2017.  (OPM ROI at 17).  The police went to Applicant\u2019s residence\nand asked for the money the witness paid her, and she provided four $20 bills.  Id. \nApplicant told the police that she was not engaging in prostitution.  The police\ninterviewed another witness who was a soldier at a nearby military installation, and\nhe said he paid for sex about four times at Applicant\u2019s residence.  Id.  (police report) \nApplicant\u2019s lawyer said she was unable to locate the two witnesses cited in the police \nreport to challenge their credibility.  (Tr. 45-46)  When Applicant was questioned by\nthe police, she \u201cwas concerned about the charges of prostitution as it would affect her\nsecurity clearance.\u201d  (GE 4)\nApplicant had difficulty estimating how many people paid her for her time;\nhowever, she estimated \u201cat least see[ing] 40 or more.\u201d  (Tr. 64-66)  She estimated\nthat she had sex with about 20 men.  (Tr. 66-67)   She was vague about how many\nof them paid after having sex with her.  (Tr. 67-68)  Some of the customers may have\nasked her for drugs; however, she always refused to give them drugs.  (Tr. 88) \nApplicant did not have anyone to protect her if the date with her customers became\nviolent.  (Tr. 87)\nApplicant consistently denied that she engaged in prostitution.  (Tr. 43, 47-\n48)  She denied that there was a direct relationship between the payment of funds and\nthe sexual activity.  (Tr. 82; SR; GE 2)   The purpose of the semi-nudity on her\nwebsite was to encourage men to call her to go out with her.  (Tr. 70)  After the first\ndate, some men continued their relationships with her and continued to pay her, and\nsome did not pay her.  (Tr. 71, 82)  As for whether she was soliciting prostitution,\nApplicant explained, in an advertisement a girl holding a soda may be wearing a\nbikini, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a prostitute.\u201d   (Tr. 93)  Applicant held a security\nclearance in the 2016 to 2017 time period when her website advertised her time to\ncustomers.  (Tr. 75)  [Decision at 5-6.]\nApplicant\u2019s prostitution charge was dismissed for lack of evidence.  After receiving her\ncitation, she stopped seeing customers from the website.  Applicant believes her former husband was\nvindictive and called the police alleging she was engaged in prostitution.  In 2016, she earned about\n$5,000 from her website activity that she did not declare on her Federal income tax return.  She did\nnot report her arrest to her facility security officer until after her background interview.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n3\n\n\u201cEach time [Applicant] engaged in sexual activity and received payment afterwards at this\nhourly rate from her customers, she committed a form of the prostitution offense.\u201d  Decision at 11.\nNone of the mitigating conditions under Guidelines D, J, and E fully apply.  Her multiple\nmisdemeanor-level prostitution offenses are relatively recent.  She has refused to admit she engaged\nin conduct that constituted prostitution. \nDiscussion\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that she engaged\nin a form of prostitution.  She emphasizes that the prostitution citation was dismissed for lack of\nevidence.  She argues \u201cthe evidence suggests that she never engaged in the exchange of money for\nsex as the money was for dates and massages.  Any sexual behavior engaged in by the [Applicant]\nwas strictly consensual and a decision made regardless of any money exchanging hands.\u201d  Appeal\nBrief at 11.  In challenging the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant engaged in prostitution, we note\nthat Applicant has not disputed any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact supporting that\nconclusion.2  Furthermore, the dismissal of a charge or citation does not establish innocence and does\nnot preclude a Judge from concluding the offense was committed based on his or her examination\nof the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21761 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 28, 2005).  Considering the\nevidence as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s challenged conclusion is based on\nsubstantial evidence and constitutes a reasonable characterization or inference that can be drawn\nfrom the evidence.  The Judge\u2019s challenged conclusion is sustainable.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 16-\n02640 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).  \nApplicant also contends that the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence and\nmisapplied the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  She argues, for example, that two\nyears have passed since her conduct at issue and that she took responsibility by admitting that she\npresented herself in a poor manner. Applicant\u2019s arguments are neither enough to rebut the\npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  We give due consideration to the Hearing\nOffice cases that Applicant\u2019s Counsel has cited, but they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal\nBoard nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id. at 3-4.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel has failed\nto establish the Judge committed harmful error.\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May\n16, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 14, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E were not\nraised as an issue on appeal and are not discussed further below.  Consistent with the following, we\naffirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is 58 years old, has worked for her current employer since 2015.  Before her\ncurrent employment, she worked as a contractor and has held a security clearance for about 15 years. \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on three of six Guideline F allegations.  She found against\nApplicant on two state tax liens totaling over $20,000 and a medical debt of $560.  \nApplicant experienced periods of unemployment, including while working for her current\nemployer.  She indicated that she received bad advice from an accountant about the filing of her self-\nemployment tax returns.  She also suffered a stroke at work that was not covered by health insurance. \nApplicant admitted that she was indebted for a state tax lien of about $7,300.  While two state\ntax liens are alleged in the SOR, she claimed she has only one state tax lien in the approximate\namount of $13,100.  She provided a 2018 state document showing she owes a balance of about\n$4,700 for tax year 2007 and about $9,000 for tax year 2009.  She attributed the past-due taxes to\ninaccurate tax filings by her accountant.  In 2011, she began making $400 payments, but it was not\nclear from the record to whom she was making those payments.  At one point, checks torn in half\nwere returned to her.  In 2018, she agreed to a 60-month payment plan with the state.  Under that\nagreement, she was to make a initial payment of $1,374 and then monthly payments of $235.  She\nhas not started making the payments because her husband had a massive heart attack, and she is the\nonly one employed.   \nApplicant stated that she was making payments on the delinquent medical account, but\nprovided no proof of those payments.  In her post-hearing submission, she provided a receipt for\n$480; however, it was not clear to whom the payment was made.  She also volunteered that she owed\nabout $8,000 in Federal taxes for 2017 and an unspecified amount in state taxes for that same year. \nShe again attributed the 2017 tax delinquencies to her old accountant; however, she has hired a new\naccountant.  \nWhile Applicant experienced conditions beyond her control, she has not acted responsibly\nto address her debts.  More specifically, she did not produce sufficient information to show that she\n2\n\nhas been proactive in her actions.  While she settled a Federal tax lien, she has not started payments\non others.  She has not shown that her financial problems are under control. \nDiscussion    \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant contends that she made payments towards the state tax liens \nthrough a collection agency and that she settled the medical debt through a third-party corporation. \nThe Judge discussed those claimed payments in the decision, indicating for both the state tax liens\nand the medical debt that it was not clear to whom Applicant made the payments.1  The Judge\u2019s\nfindings regarding state tax liens are generally consistent with the evidence in the record.  They are\nbased upon substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences therefrom.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 17-01181 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 2018).  Additionally, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\ndid not produce sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns arising from the two state\ntax liens is sustainable.  As the Board has previously stated, it is reasonable for Judge to expect\napplicants to present documentation showing that debts have been resolved or are being resolved. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008).  The balance of Applicant\u2019s\narguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not\nsufficient to establish harmful error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10,\n2018).  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

In discussing the $400 state tax lien payments, the Judge stated, \u201cbut it was not clear from the record that\nthe payment was going to the IRS.\u201d  Decision at 3.  At the hearing, Applicant indicated that payments were going to an\nunspecified collection company.  Tr. at 22.   In the appeal brief, Applicant states the payments were going to a collection\nagency, not the IRS. \nEven though the Judge may have erred in failing to include the receipt for either $488 or $480 in the record and may have \nerred in referring to the IRS regarding the state tax lien payments, these were harmless errors because they did not likely\naffect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).  As discussed above,\nthe unresolved state tax liens are sufficient to sustain the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance decision.  \n3\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan               \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 24, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 3, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Richard A. Cefola granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nDepartment Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is 60 years old, has been an employee of a defense contractor since 2015. \nHe has been married twice and has three adult children.   He admitted the sole SOR allegation that\nasserted he had a Federal tax lien of about $48,000 filed against him in 2014.  This lien was incurred\nbecause he owed past-due income taxes for 2009-2011.1  He attributed this debt to not being\nprepared to be the owner-operator of a business, to suffering a heart attack in 2009 that resulted in\na period of unemployment, and to helping his daughter with her expenses.  \nIn 2017, Applicant made two Offers in Compromise to the IRS.  In December 2017, as\nevidenced by IRS correspondence and his banking statements,  he reached an installment agreement\nwith the IRS to make monthly payments of $878.  He also received financial counseling.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n\u201cApplicant\u2019s tax lien has been addressed through an agreement with the IRS.  He is making\npayments pursuant to that agreement.  He has also received financial counseling to ensure that future\nfinancial problems are unlikely.  Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established.\u201d  Decision at 5.\n  \n \nDiscussion\nDepartment Counsel argues that the record in this case does not support the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable mitigation analysis.  She also contends that the Judge did not consider important aspects\nof the case and his analysis runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  Department\nCounsel\u2019s arguments have merit. \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\n1 Applicant\u2019s IRS tax transcripts reflected that, as of February 2018, he owed $46,219 of past-due taxes and\ninterest for 2009, did not owe past-due taxes for 2010 (his 2010 tax debt was resolved in 2012), and owed $870 of\ninterest for 2011.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) N.  \n2\n\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371, U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d   Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of\nthe national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s\ndecision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After\nthe Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to\nrebut or mitigate those concerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at\n3 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018).\nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate\na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts\nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment;\nit fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs\ncontrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference\nof opinion.  Id.\nAt the outset, we note Department Counsel\u2019s arguments are of mixed merit.  She repeats an\nargument that the Board has rejected at least twice, i.e., \u201cMitigating Conditions 20(d) and 20(g) must\nbe read in concert and harmony with the overall parameters of analysis set forth by the Appeal\nBoard.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 13.  This is not accurate.  As we have previously stated, \u201cThe Appeal Board \nand Hearing Office Judges are creatures of the Directive.  While some analysis and precedents might\nsurvive amendments to the Directive or guidelines, it is mistaken to believe that the guidelines are\nsomehow inferior to the Appeal Board\u2019s decisions.  More succinctly, the provisions of the Directive,\nincluding the guidelines, are controlling.\u201d   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 4, n.2 (App. Bd.\nJun. 29, 2018) and ISCR Case No. 16-03187 at 4, n.4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018).  Furthermore,\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s relevant arguments rely entirely on case law that predates the current\nguidelines without any acknowledgment that the content of the new guidelines may have narrowed\nor superceded the prior case law.  \nThat said, Department Counsel\u2019s other arguments, such as her contention that the Judge did\nnot consider important aspects of the case, are meritorious.  She points out that the Judge failed to\naddress that Applicant did not file his Federal income tax return for 2009 as required.  His 2009 IRS\ntax transcript reflects that the IRS filed a substitute tax return for him in early February 2012 and\n3\n\ndetermined he owed an additional $44,731 of taxes for that tax year.2  AE N.  She also notes that\nApplicant changed his W-4 exemptions to \u201cten\u201d for  2011.   Tr. at 37.  Due to that change in\nexemptions, Applicant testified \u201cthey weren\u2019t taking any taxes out\u201d of his pay.  Id.  He used the extra\nmoney to purchase a custom motorcycle, which was an item on his \u201cbucket list.\u201d  Id. and 65-66. \nWhen analyzing a case, a Judge must consider the evidence as a whole and not view it in an isolated\nor piecemeal manner that focuses only on matters favorable to one party.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n14-05005 at 8 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017).  In this case, the Judge erred by failing to analyze\nsignificant matters that undermined his mitigation analysis.  \nDepartment Counsel also challenges that Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s recent\ninstallment agreement mitigates the security concerns arising from his past-due taxes for 2009 and\n2011.  First, she argues the Judge erred in failing to address the timing of Applicant\u2019s actions to\naddress his tax deficiencies.  As we have previously stated, a Judge may consider the underlying\ncircumstances of tax debt in evaluating an applicant\u2019s reliability and judgment.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 17-00378 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2018).  Furthermore, an applicant who resolves financial\nproblems after being placed on notice his or her security clearance was in jeopardy may lack the\njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate\nthreat to his own interests.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). \nApplicant\u2019s 2009 IRS tax transcript reflects that he made one $100 payment towards his 2009 tax\ndeficiency before the SOR was issued in March 2017.  AE N.  After issuance of the SOR, he made\nsporadic payments and submitted an Offer in Compromise (which was later withdrawn) before he\nentered into an installment agreement with the IRS one month prior to the hearing.  In her brief,\nDepartment Counsel also points out that Applicant has been consistently employed since 2005 (with\nthe exception of a four-month period in 2009-2010), and he had an adjusted gross income (AGI) of\nabout $117,000 in 2014.3  Additionally, Department Counsel notes that Applicant only submitted\nproof of one payment under the installment agreement, which was made after the hearing was held. \nShe argues that proof of one payment under a 62-month installment plan is less than convincing\nevidence that Applicant was adhering to or in compliance with the installment agreement.4     \n2 Applicant\u2019s 2009 IRS tax transcript also reflects that his tax return for that year was received on February 14,\n2012.\n3 Tr. at 35-36, Government Exhibit 1, and AE N.  Applicant\u2019s IRS tax transcripts reflect that he filed as \u201cSingle\u201d\nfor 2009-2011 and his AGI for those years ranged from about $47,400 to $78,100; he filed as \u201cHead of Household\u201d for\n2012 and his AGI was about $51,600; he filed as \u201cMarried Filing Joint\u201d for 2013 and 2014 and his AGI for those years\nwas about $83,700 and $117,000; and he filed as \u201cMarried Filing Separate\u201d for 2015 and 2016 and his AGI for those\nyears was about $53,300 and $44,700.    \n4 In the decision, the Judge failed to identify the specific mitigating conditions that applied.  He noted five\nmitigating conditions were potentially applicable.  Those mitigating conditions are set forth in Directive , Encl. 2, App.\nA \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(d) and (g) as follows:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n4\n\n\u201cNational security eligibility determinations take into account a person's stability,\ntrustworthiness, reliability, discretion, character, honesty, and judgment.\u201d  Directive , Encl. 2, App.\nA \u00b6 1(b).   Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with\nabiding by well-established government rules and regulations.  Voluntary compliance with rules and\nregulations is essential for protecting classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at\n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016).  In this case, Applicant failed to address his significant 2009 Federal\nincome tax debt for a number of years and did so only after his security clearance was in jeopardy. \nSuch a failure raises questions about whether he has demonstrated the high degree of judgment and\nreliability that is required for granting an individual access to classified information.  \n \nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision failed to consider important aspects of the case and\nruns contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  Furthermore, we conclude that the record\nevidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under\nthe Egan standard.\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death,\ndivorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a\nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts; [and]\n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the\namount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\nAs written, the Judge\u2019s decision leaves us guessing which mitigating conditions he concluded either fully or partially\napplied.  This was error.  As we have previously stated, the Judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows the\nparties and the Board to discern what findings the Judge is making and what conclusions he or she is reaching.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2018).\n5\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan             \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant has a history of significant delinquent debt, including back taxes owed the Federal Government. While they were married, Applicant\u2019s now ex-wife had many personal problems, for which Applicant paid for counseling and medical treatment. He hired a lawyer to assist him in a dispute with child protective services, occasioned by his wife\u2019s difficulties. Applicant was not able to pay all of his bills, and he was discharged in bankruptcy in 2008. He claimed to have a payment plan with the IRS, which was interrupted after his credit union closed his account. He stated that he could not set up another payment plan but documented that he has been making payments to the IRS since mid-2018. He did not provide documentation from the IRS showing how much he previously paid and how much he still owes. He filed his 2017 Federal and state income tax returns, but he did not show that he paid the Federal tax obligation owed for that year. Applicant stated that his financial problems stabilized after his bankruptcy discharge. However, in 2016, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife was evicted from her home and moved in with their daughter. Applicant provided his wife and daughter with financial support, as he did for his two other children. He did so at the expense of paying his own debts.

He\nargues that the Judge should have applied the guidelines in effect on the date of his SOR. \nHowever, as Department Counsel states in his Reply Brief, the DoD has implemented Security\nExecutive Agent Directive 4, mandating that all adjudications will utilize the new guidelines. \nThis requirement applies without regard to the date of an SOR.  Applicant received notice of this \nalong with copies of the appropriate guidelines.  Applicant also contends that DOHA unduly\ndelayed convening his hearing until after his 2017 taxes were due, thereby prompting the Judge\nto inquire into their status to his detriment.  However, it was Applicant himself who broached his\n2016 and 2017 tax filings.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge denied him due process;\nwhether the Judge raised concerns not included in the SOR; whether the Judge placed improper\nlimitations on Applicant\u2019s evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E are not at issue\nin this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant has a history of\nsignificant delinquent debt, including back taxes owed the Federal Government.  While they were\nmarried, Applicant\u2019s now ex-wife had many personal problems, for which Applicant paid for\ncounseling and medical treatment.  He hired a lawyer to assist him in a dispute with child protective\nservices, occasioned by his wife\u2019s difficulties.  Applicant was not able to pay all of his bills, and he\nwas discharged in bankruptcy in 2008.  \nHe claimed to have a payment plan with the IRS, which was interrupted after his credit union\nclosed his account.  He stated that he could not set up another payment plan but documented that\nhe has been making payments to the IRS since mid-2018.  He did not provide documentation from\nthe IRS showing how much he previously paid and how much he still owes.  He filed his 2017\nFederal and state income tax returns, but he did not show that he paid the Federal tax obligation\nowed for that year.  Applicant stated that his financial problems stabilized after his bankruptcy\ndischarge.  However, in 2016, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife was evicted from her home and moved in with\ntheir daughter.  Applicant provided his wife and daughter with financial support, as he did for his\ntwo other children.  He did so at the expense of paying his own debts.\nThe Judge found that some of the debts alleged in the SOR were duplicates of others or were\nnot substantiated.  He also found that some of the SOR debts had been resolved but that a number \nhad not been, including those to the IRS.  Applicant has received financial counseling and is making\n2\n\npayments on a plan proposed by \u201ca noted financial advisor.\u201d  Decision at 3.  In addition, he is\nworking additional jobs, maintains a budget, and is setting aside funds for emergency situations.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems raised three disqualifying\nconditions: inability to satisfy debts, a history of not meeting financial obligations, and failure to file\nor fraudulently filing tax returns or failure to pay income tax as required.1  The Judge noted\ncircumstances outside Applicant\u2019s control that affected his financial problems, such as his family\u2019s\nmedical expenses and unexpected car repairs.  However, he also concluded that Applicant had not\nprovided sufficient corroborating evidence to show that he had acted responsibly in resolving his\ndebts.  Though noting his debt resolution plan, the Judge stated that it constituted nothing more than\na promise to resolve debts in the future rather than a track record of debt payment.  He also stated\nthat, \u201c[f]or whatever reason, Applicant has left me in the dark about his taxes,\u201d noting a paucity of\ncorroborating evidence concerning the amounts paid, the amount yet owed, etc.  Decision at 7.  The\nJudge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and ongoing and continue to cast\ndoubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\nDiscussion\nApplicant has raised some due process issues. He notes that the Judge applied adjudicative\nguidelines that were effective as of June 8, 2017,  after the date of his SOR.  He argues that the\nJudge should have applied the guidelines in effect on the date of his SOR.  However, as Department\nCounsel states in his Reply Brief, the DoD has implemented Security Executive Agent Directive 4,\nmandating that all adjudications will utilize the new guidelines.  This requirement applies without\nregard to the date of an SOR.  See ISCR Case No. 15-02728 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2018).2 \nApplicant received notice of this, both from the Department Counsel and from the Chief Hearing\nOffice Judge, along with copies of the appropriate guidelines.  Applicant also contends that DOHA\nunduly delayed convening his hearing until after his 2017 taxes were due, thereby prompting the\nJudge to inquire into their status to his detriment.  However, it was Applicant himself who broached\nhis 2016 and 2017 tax filings.  Tr. at 58.  In any event, we find no reason to believe that if these\n1Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 19 (a, c, and f).\n2  See also Security Executive Agent Directive 4 at heading \u201c(Effective: 08 JUNE 2017)\u201d; \u201cB. PURPOSE:  This\nSecurity Executive Agent (SecEA) Directive establishes the single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered\nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive\nposition.  The Guidelines reflected herein supercede all previously issued national security adjudicative criteria or\nguidelines. . . .   E. POLICY: 1. The National Security Adjudicative Guidelines in Appendix A shall be used by all\nauthorized adjudicative agencies when rendering a determination for initial or continued eligibility for access to classified\ninformation or initial or continued eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . . . [and]  F. EFFECTIVE DATE: This\nDirective becomes effective 180 days after the date of signature.\u201d [It was signed on 10 December 2016.]\n3\n\nsubsequent tax years had not been considered the Judge would have arrived at a different decision.3 \nThere is no reason to conclude that the timing of the hearing prejudiced Applicant\u2019s ability to\npresent his case for mitigation.  Accordingly, we have no authority to comment on the manner in\nwhich officials have processed Applicant\u2019s case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-12730 at 2 (App. Bd.\nSep. 4, 2013).  Applicant was not denied due process.\nApplicant contends that the Judge improperly considered matters that were not alleged in the\nSOR, specifically information about his 2016 and 2017 income tax returns.  Again, it was Applicant\nwho introduced the subject of his subsequent returns.  Moreover, it was not improper for the Judge\nto have considered this matter, insofar as non-alleged conduct can be relevant on issues of\nmitigation, rehabilitation, the whole-person analysis, etc.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017).  Our review of the Decision and of the record as a whole persuades us\nthat the Judge considered this evidence in its proper context.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge improperly limited the evidence that he wished to submit. \nHe argues that, by commenting upon a paucity of documentary corroboration, the Judge discounted\nhis hearing testimony, thereby imposing an evidentiary standard not found within the Directive. \nHowever, it is reasonable to expect an applicant to present corroborating documentation of his\nefforts at debt resolution.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07062 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2017).  In a\nDOHA proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of persuasion that he or she should have access\nto classified information, and corroborating evidence can go a long way toward enabling an\napplicant to meet that burden.  We note that the Judge admitted all documents that Applicant\nproffered, and we find nowhere in the transcript that the Judge curtailed his testimony.  Indeed, he\nkept the record open for four months after the hearing, over Department Counsel\u2019s objection.  Tr.\npp. 84-86, 91.  Applicant appears to be arguing that the Judge should have extended more weight\nto his testimony that was apparently the case, which is not the same thing as demonstrating the Judge\nprevented him from submitting evidence itself.  The Judge did not limit Applicant\u2019s ability to\npresent his case in mitigation.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nIn making this argument, he asserts that the Judge erred in concluding that his circumstances raised\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F.  In addition to his claim that the Judge relied upon the wrong\nset of guidelines, which we have already rejected, he contends that his financial problems were\nunfortunate but did not raise security concerns in the absence of any \u201caggravating factors.\u201d  Appeal\nBrief at 12.  There is no support for Applicant\u2019s argument about aggravating factors.  The Directive\nimposes no such requirement.  To the contrary, the Directive provides that delinquent debts\nthemselves can raise concerns about an applicant\u2019s willingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nthereby giving rise to questions about his or her ability to protect classified information.  Directive,\nEncl. 2, App. A \u00b6 18.; ISCR Case No. 15-01737 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14,  2017).  Indeed, the\n3Applicant\u2019s argument is predicated, in part, on the premise that failure to pay taxes would not have been\nincluded in Statements of Reasons under the old guidelines.  This premise is mistaken.  For two examples of cases under\nthose guidelines in which failure to pay taxes was a security issue (without a failure to file component) see ISCR Case\n09-07064 (App. Bd. Nov. 18, 2011) and ISCR Case No. 14-05489 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2016).\n4\n\nDirective presumes that there is a nexus between admitted or proved conduct or circumstances under\nany of the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02595 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018).  Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt and\nin particular his debt to the IRS are sufficient to raise security concerns, thereby shifting the burden\nof production to Applicant.  The balance of Applicant\u2019s brief is, in effect, a challenge to the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence.  However, an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the record\nis not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018). \nIn support of his arguments, Applicant refers to the \u201cimminent threat to the national interest\u201d\nstandard set forth in Directive \u00b6 6.4,4 which applies to the suspension of a previously adjudicated\nsecurity clearance pending a final clearance decision.  Applicant\u2019s reliance on \u00b6 6.4 is misplaced. \nFirst, his security clearance was not suspended under \u00b6 6.4.  Second, the \u201cimminent threat to the\nnational security\u201d standard is for use by the appropriate DoD official in reviewing a proposed\nsecurity clearance suspension and not for use by Judges in adjudicating security clearance eligibility. \nThird, the Judge\u2019s decision in this case is an integral part of and, depending on the circumstances,\ncould constitute the final clearance decision.5  See, Directive \u00b6 E3.1.36.  See also, ISCR Case No.\n14-05238 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 13, 2016) for the proposition that \u00b6 6.4 is limited in scope and that as\na general matter the Government does not have to prove a \u201c\u2018clear and present danger\u2019 to national\nsecurity\u201d before it can deny an applicant a clearance.  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in\nfavor of the national security.\u201d\n4 In his argument Applicant refers to \u00b6 6.4 and uses the phrase \u201cimminent threat to national security\u201d instead\nof \u201cimminent threat to the national interest\u201d as set forth in that provision.

On\nNovember 16, 2018, the Judge issued a Remand Decision in which he again denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a CAC.  Applicant appealed pursuant to DoD Directive 5220.6.  \nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Finding of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is 55 years old, has been working in a position that requires CAC eligibility\nsince late 2015.  He is retired from the Air National Guard.  The SOR alleges that Applicant was\narrested and charged with felony first-degree assault, misdemeanor second-degree assault, and\nmisdemeanor reckless endangerment in 2016.  At that time, he was living with his girlfriend and\ntheir two-year-old child.  He became angry when he thought his girlfriend hid his car keys.  He\nclimbed on top of her in bed and choked her for about ten seconds.  He allegedly said, \u201cI should kill\nyou now.\u201d  Decision at 3.  She told police she feared he would kill her and there had been other\nunreported incidents of domestic violence.  The charges were dismissed and expunged from his\nrecord.  He provided a statement of his community involvement. \nOther than indicating the charges were dismissed, Applicant did not provide information\nrefuting them or addressing the underlying conduct, which is indicative of a significant inability to\ncontrol impulsive or violent behavior.  His alleged conduct was not minor and occurred less than\ntwo years ago.  He did not provide information establishing rehabilitation or remorse.  Applicant\u2019s\nresponse did not sufficiently address the unacceptable risk concerns.  \n  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief draws our attention to his evidence of good character and\ncommunity involvement.  In addition, it contains statements and documents that were not previously\nsubmitted to the Judge for consideration.  The Appeal Board may not receive or consider new\nevidence.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29 \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  In light of the\nrecord as a whole, we conclude that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a\nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \n2\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan                \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

On June\n5, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On November 27, 2018, after considering the record,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Caroline E. Heintzelman\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant has used marijuana in the recent past.  He began doing so in 2008, in order to\nrelieve pain caused by a knee ailment, and a few years later he began growing it himself.  In his\nsecurity clearance application (SCA)  he advised that he used marijuana until May 2015.  Although\nhe claimed in his SCA that he would not do so again, in fact he later told his interviewer that he used\nit twice between August 2015 and January 2017.  On this last occasion he used marijuana with\nfriends \u201cbecause it was there.\u201d  Decision at 3.  From February 2012 until June 2015 Applicant\nmisused various prescription medications, such as morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, Oxycontin,\ntramadol, suboxone, xanax, Ativan, amphetetamines, Ritalin, and soma.  He stated that he stopped\nusing controlled substances after consultation with a health care provider.  He stated that he would\nnever have abused drugs if he had known the effect it would have on his clearance, and he signed\na statement of intent never to re-offend.\nApplicant\u2019s misuse of controlled substances constituted a pattern of behavior that impugns\nhis willingness to follow rules and regulations.  Even though Applicant\u2019s misconduct occurred off\nduty, it reflects poor judgment and raises questions about his fitness for access to classified\ninformation.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief alludes to the time that it has taken to adjudicate his SCA.  We do not have\nauthority to comment on the manner in which officials conduct clearance investigations.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 14-04186 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2015).  He draws our attention to various pieces\nof record evidence that support his effort to obtain a favorable decision, for example documents\nsubstantiating his medical problems, his statement of intent not to misuse drugs in the future, his\nexplanations for his security-significant conduct, etc.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption\nthat the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed\nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

On July\n17, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On March 29, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings and\nconclusions and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is in his mid-50s, has worked for his current employer for about six years. \nHe has multiple post-graduate degrees.

In 2011, Applicant was again investigated.  A laboratory had lost evidence\nfrom 2007 and inspected new material.  Additionally, a mix-up led to a hard drive not belonging to\nApplicant being made part of the investigation.   During an interview, Applicant was asked about\na website he had visited and chose to end the interview.  His access to classified information was\nsuspended in 2012.  Four to six questionable images were discovered on Applicant\u2019s media.  Two\nof them \u201cwere identified as containing known child victims identified by the National Center for\nMissing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).\u201d  Decision at 3.  Federal and local authorities declined\nto prosecute.  In 2013, however, Applicant was issued a general officer letter of reprimand for having\nchild pornography and unsecured classified information in his home.  Soon after the reprimand\nbecame final, Applicant was transferred to the retired Reserves with the recommendation his security\nclearance be revoked.  \nHaving viewed the images uncovered during the investigation, Applicant disputes that they\nconstitute child pornography.  He testified that he had never seen those images before.  While some\n1 At the hearing, Applicant testified the documents were marked Secret and included an annex to an operations\norder.  Tr. at 159.\n2\n\nof the images reflected nude and scantily clothed individuals, he argued none were engaged in sexual\nactivity and, therefore, could not be deemed child pornography.  He acknowledged that his reputation\nwould be harmed if issues regarding his sexual behavior became public knowledge. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nLaw enforcement agencies linked Applicant to known child pornography websites through \ncredit card transactions.   After the investigation was reopened and he was asked about specific web-\nsites, Applicant quit cooperating with investigators.  \u201cWhat was deemed to be child pornography was\nfound,\u201d but civilian authorities declined to prosecute.  Decision at 4.   The military found that\nApplicant\u2019s conduct was \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d and issued him a formal reprimand and\nrecommend his security clearance be revoked.  His sexual behavior has become a concern for\nexploitation and could affect his reputation in the community.  \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s continued protestation that the material at issue was not child pornography,\ndespite the fact this is not the forum to appeal previous findings by [a law enforcement agency] and\nthe military, makes it difficult to judge whether such behavior could recur.\u201d  Decision at 5.  The\nevidence brings into question Applicant\u2019s judgment and current reliability.  He is not in treatment\nnor has he recently completed such a program.  None of the sexual behavior mitigating conditions\napply.  \n\u201cApplicant admits public knowledge of the facts involved would harm his reputation.\u201d \nDecision at 6.  Additionally, sensitive or protected information was found on his personal media in\n2007.   His conduct reflects poor judgment and a lack of trustworthiness.  He has not established that\nsome similar conduct will not occur in the future.  Pertinent personal conduct mitigating conditions\ndo not apply.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel challenges some of the Judge\u2019s finding and conclusions.  For example,\nhe contends that there was evidence that the child pornography was not the property of Applicant. \nThis claim is based on Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that another person\u2019s hard drive\nbecame mixed with his evidence at the laboratory.  Tr. at 31, 33, 66-68, and 86-91.  There is no\nmention of this supposed mix-up in the investigative reports that are in evidence.  Government\nExhibits 3 and 5.  Moreover, when Applicant was asked at the hearing whether there was any\nindication that the child pornography images at issue came from the other person\u2019s hard drive, he\nresponded, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d  Tr. at 91.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel also argues that Mitigating Condition\n14(c) (the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress) should apply\nbecause \u201cthere was never a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress as all [his] family members and\n[his] close friends are privy to this information, as well as [his] previous employer when these\nallegation were levied.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 9.  Of note, the statement that all of Applicant\u2019s family and\nfriends are privy to information about the alleged conduct is not supported by the evidence.  Further, \nApplicant testified that, if negative information was published about him, it might hurt his reputation\n(Tr. at 141) and that no one at his current job knows about the possession of child pornography\n3\n\nallegation (Tr. at 142).  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions\nare based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018). \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel argues Applicant\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified material was\npreviously adjudicated and resulted in him being granted a security clearance with a warning.   To\nthe extent that Applicant\u2019s Counsel is arguing the Government is equitably estopped from\nreconsidering that matter, we do not find his argument persuasive.  Applicant was granted the\nsecurity clearance with a warning after the investigation first closed and before the child pornography\nwas discovered when it was reopened.  In other words, additional security concerns came to light\nafter the security clearance was granted.  As we have previously stated, a prior decision to grant a\nsecurity clearance to an applicant does not give the applicant any vested right or entitlement in\nkeeping a security clearance.  Nor would it preclude the Federal Government from considering at\na future date whether to continue that grant or revoke it.  Furthermore, the Federal Government is\nnot equitably estopped from denying or revoking a security clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-\n0519 at 15 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2001).  \n Applicant\u2019s Counsel asserts that the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence  and\nmisapplied the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  For example, Applicant\u2019s Counsel\ncontends \u201cthe [Judge failed] to properly take into account [Applicant\u2019s] whole person concept, the\nunique circumstances associated with the 2007 and 2011 investigations, the complete lack of review\nof material psychological evidence, the fact that three (3) different State and Federal prosecutors\ndeclined to prosecute [Applicant] for deficient evidence, and the fact that these incidents occurred\napproximately twelve (12) years ago without any repeat behavior.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 12-13.  Of note,\nthe Appeal Board has declined to establish a \"bright-line\" test regarding the concept of recency.  The\nconclusion of the Judge that past misconduct still remains a security concern must be evaluated\nthrough careful consideration of the totality of the specific record at hand.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n99-0018 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2000).   Applicant\u2019s reliance on the age of the misconduct is\nundercut by the fact that currently Applicant denies that he has viewed or possessed child\npornography.  When an applicant is unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for his or her own\nactions, such a failure is evidence that detracts from a finding of reform and rehabilitation.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 96-0360 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997).  Moreover, regarding the claim by\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel that the psychological evidence was not reviewed, we note Applicant asserted\nthe doctor-patient privilege when Department Counsel asked him if he told his treatment providers\nthat he was found to be in possession of child pornography.  Tr. at 120-124, 144-145, and 153.  In\naddressing Applicant\u2019s assertion of the doctor-patient privilege, the Judge noted that Applicant\noffered into evidence a letter from a psychiatrist discussing Applicant\u2019s mental heath diagnoses\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) L) and stated, \u201cI can give it [AE L] the appropriate weight if there is\nnothing more behind it.\u201d  Tr. at 123-124.  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s statement that he could\ndetermine the appropriate weight that AE L should be accorded.  Furthermore, a Judge is not\nrequired to discuss each and every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01500 at\n3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015).  Overall, the arguments of Applicant\u2019s Counsel are neither enough to\nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that\nthe Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\n4\n\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01717 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2017).  We give due consideration to the\nHearing Office case that Applicant\u2019s Counsel has cited, but it is neither binding precedent on the\nAppeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel has failed\nto establish the Judge committed harmful error.\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant is in his late-40s and is married with two children.  He was born in Egypt and\nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree there.  He entered the United States in the late 2000s, became a U.S.\ncitizen in 2015, and later earned a master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university.  He has worked on Federal \nGovernment projects, including [Redacted]. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has foreign family members and foreign financial interests. \nThose family members include his mother, siblings, mother-in-law, and siblings-in-law who are\ncitizens and residents of Egypt.  His mother and one sibling-in-law served as professionals in an\nEgyptian government ministry and are now retired.

He speaks to his in-laws periodically\n.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s Egyptian assets totaled about $354,000.  He sold one of\nthe properties shortly before the hearing.  Applicant estimated that another property was worth about\nhalf of the SOR-listed amount of  $125,000.  He wants to keep this property so that he could use it\nduring visits.  Applicant\u2019s equity in another property is about $3,500.  He closed his two bank\naccounts in Egypt.  Due to depreciation of the Egyptian currency, his foreign bank certificates and\nsavings bonds are about $6,000, instead of the alleged amount of $16,000.  His children have bank\ncertificates in Egypt worth about $8,000.  His spouse\u2019s Egyptian bank holdings, which were alleged\nto total about $64,000, now are about $25,000.  Due to either liquidation or depreciation, the value\nof his Egyptian assets now range from about $149,000 to $163,500.  Applicant and his spouse both\nhave six-figure salaries.  He estimates his U.S. assets total about $1.7 million.  He provided\nreferences that vouch for his exemplary character. \n2\n\nSince 1979, Egypt and the United States have maintained strong economic and security ties. \nThe U.S. State Department has warned U.S. citizens of the risks of terrorism in Egypt.  Several\nterrorist groups, including ISIS, have committed deadly attacks there, including the targeting of\ngovernment officials.  Such attacks are likely to continue.  Egypt has a record of human rights\nabuses.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s family members and financial interests in Egypt created a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation.  His assets in Egypt, however, have substantially decreased since the SOR was\nissued.  His current Egyptian assets, totaling about $163,000, are less than 1% of his U.S. assets.1 \nThe value of his foreign assets are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively\nto influence or pressure him.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother is elderly and does not know that he works on U.S. Government projects. \nHis contacts with his siblings are less frequent.  With the exception of his one sibling, \u201cnone of these\nrelatives have any ties to the government or military.\u201d  Decision at 10.  \u201cNor do any of these relatives\n(including the [sibling] working for the [government]) know that Applicant is seeking a security\nclearance or the details of what his job entails.  Applicant has been very assiduous in not providing\nany details about his work to his Egyptian relatives.  I do not find the frequency of Applicant\u2019s\ncontacts with his Egyptian family members sufficient to raise security concerns.\u201d  Id.   \nApplicant arrived in the United States in the late-2000s and became a U.S. citizen in 2015. \nHe is in the process of selling his current home and buying another valued at $950,000.  He testified\ncredibly that, if he learned that one of his family members was being exploited, he would report it\nto appropriate authorities.  He has established himself as a solid U.S. citizen.  He has deep loyalty\nto the United States and would resolve any conflict in favor of the United States.    \nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6 2(b). \n1 We note that, based on the Judge\u2019s findings, the current calculation is over 9%.\n3\n\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018).\nDepartment Counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis.  At the outset, it merits\nnoting the Judge reached inconsistent conclusions regarding whether security concerns were created\ndue to Applicant\u2019s contacts with his foreign family members.  In his analysis, the Judge initially\nstated:\nApplicant has connections to his mother, his [siblings], and his in-laws, who are all\ncitizens and residents of Egypt.  There is an articulated heightened risk associated\nwith having ties to family members in Egypt, due to the activities of terrorist\norganizations and insurgents operating within its borders.  In addition, Applicant had\nover $350,000 in Egypt, between real estate and bank accounts, when the SOR was\nissued.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the . . . disqualifying conditions [in\nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f).]  [Decision at 9.]  \nThe Judge later contradicts a portion of that conclusion by stating, \u201cI do not find the frequency of\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his Egyptian family members sufficient to raise security concerns.\u201d \nDecision at 10.  It is error for the Judge to conclude, on the one hand, that specific SOR allegations\n(i.e., Applicant\u2019s contacts with his foreign relatives) create security concerns (i.e. disqualifying\nconditions apply to those circumstances) and, on the other hand, conclude those allegations or\nforeign contacts do not raise security concerns.  See ISCR Case No. 14-02149 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Mar.\n5, 2019) for a discussion of a similar contradiction in a Judge\u2019s Guideline B analysis.  If the Judge \nmeant to say the frequency of Applicant\u2019s contact with his foreign relatives mitigates the pertinent\nsecurity concerns, then we do not agree with that conclusion.  The Judge found that Applicant\nmaintains weekly contact with his mother and monthly contact with his siblings.  Those contacts are\nnot so casual or infrequent to mitigate the resulting security concerns.  Furthermore, infrequency of\ncontact is not necessarily enough to rebut the presumption an applicant has ties of affection for, or\nobligation to, his or her own immediate family as well as his or her spouse\u2019s immediate family. \nCompare, ISCR Case No. 17-03450 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2019).\nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge erred in concluding that, with the\nexception of Applicant\u2019s sibling who works for the Egyptian government, none of his other relatives\nhave ties to that country\u2019s government.  Department Counsel correctly points out that Applicant\u2019s\nmother and one of his sibling-in-law are retired government employees and his other sibling-in-law\nstill works for the government.  Department Counsel further contends that the Judge\nmischaracterized the nature of the employment of Applicant\u2019s sibling with the Egyptian government. \nAppeal Brief at 3.  In his security clearance application, Applicant stated this sibling was a\n[Redacted].  Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 40.  In responding to the SOR, he also admitted without\n4\n\nqualification that this sibling was a [Redacted].  In the findings of fact, the Judge stated,\n\u201cApplicant\u2019s [sibling in question] has an administrative position with the Egyptian [Redacted].  It\nis not a political appointment but is a civil service position.\u201d  [Decision at 4.]  This finding is\napparently based on Applicant\u2019s testimony that this sibling \u201cdoes some administrative work . . . I\ndon\u2019t know exactly the details of what [the sibling] does, but I know [the sibling] is in the\n[Redacted].\u201d  Tr. at 26 and 64-65.  Department Counsel argues this apparent contradiction in the\nsibling\u2019s employment responsibilities has a significant impact in terms of assessing the security risk\nthat this sibling presents.  We note (and  the Judge found) that Applicant admitted the SOR\nallegation asserting the sibling in question is a [Redacted], which is sufficient to establish by\nsubstantial evidence the sibling holds that status.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd.\nApr. 20, 2018).     \nDepartment Counsel argues that \u201cthe biggest and more relevant concern arises from\nApplicant\u2019s [sibling\u2019s] employment as a [Redacted] with the Egyptian [government].\u201d  Appeal Brief\nat 15.  We agree.  Applicant\u2019s employment involves [Redacted] for the United States.  The nature\nof Applicant\u2019s and his sibling\u2019s employment creates a potential conflict of interest that, on its face,\nis significant.  In this regard, it also merits noting that the Judge made apparent inconsistent\nstatements regarding the extent of the knowledge this sibling has about Applicant\u2019s employment. \nAt one point, the Judge indicated that Applicant\u2019s siblings \u201cknew at some point Applicant was\nworking on [Redacted].\u201d  Decision at 4.  Later, the Judge contradicted that statement by saying,\n\u201cNor do any of these relatives (including the [sibling] working for the [Egyptian government]) know\n. . . the details about what [Applicant\u2019s] job entails.\u201d  Decision at 10.  The Judge\u2019s decision does not\ndirectly or adequately analyze the apparent conflict of interest arising from the nature of Applicant\u2019s\nand his sibling\u2019s employment. \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s sibling as a [Redacted] of the Egyptian government also gives rise\nto security concerns.  In the past, we have recognized that an applicant\u2019s ties, either directly or\nthrough a family member, to persons of high rank in a foreign government or military are of\nparticular concern, insofar as it is foreseeable that through an association with such persons the\napplicant could come to the attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. protected information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 2 and 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009) (Applicant\u2019s brother was a\nhigh-level foreign government official); ISCR Case No.11-04980 at 2 and 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21,\n2012) (Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law was married to a retired high-ranking official in a foreign army);\nand ISCR Case No. 11-12632 at 2 and 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2015) (Applicant\u2019s niece was an employee\nof a high-ranking foreign government official).  Given the facts in this case, it is foreseeable that the\nhigh-level governmental position of Applicant\u2019s sibling could become a means through which parties\ncould attempt to exert pressure on him.  The Judge\u2019s decision fails to analyze the security\nsignificance arising from the sibling\u2019s high-level governmental position.   \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen about three years before the hearing.  He has not filed\npaperwork to renounce his Egyptian citizenship. Tr. at 53-54; GE 1.   His wife, and his children are\ndual citizens, each retaining their Egyptian citizenship.  Tr. at 56 and 58-59; GE 1 and 2.  Applicant\u2019s\nties to Egypt are significant.  The record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that, given the\n5\n\nspecific security concerns present in this case, that Applicant\u2019s relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\nwould necessarily outweigh his sense of loyalty or obligation to his relatives in Egypt.  Application\nof the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that\npeople may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-\none, such as a family member.  As stated above, any doubt concerning security clearance eligibility\nmust be resolved in favor of the national security. \n      \nBased on our review of the record, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and\ncapricious because it fails to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice\nmade, fails to consider important aspects of the case, and runs contrary to the weight of the record\nevidence.  Furthermore, we conclude that the record evidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient\nto mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under the Egan standard.  The decision is not\nsustainable.  \nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan               \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMark A. Myers, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nDecember 18, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C\n(Foreign Preference) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 21, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Philip J. Katauskas granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed properly\nto apply the Guideline B disqualifying conditions and whether the Judge\u2019s favorable decision under\nGuideline B was unsupported by the greater weight of the record evidence and, therefore, was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Department Counsel raised no issues regarding the concern\nalleged under Guideline C.  Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant was born in Iraq, came to the U.S. in the mid-2000s, and became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in about 2013.  Applicant has worked for Defense contractors since 2003, except for several\nmonths between 2014 and 2016.  Divorced, she has a child.  Though currently employed by a\nDefense contractor, Applicant has enlisted in the U.S. military.\nApplicant has close family members who are citizens and residents of Iraq\u2013her mother and\nseveral siblings.  Applicant claimed that she broke off contact with her Iraqi family in late 2017, after\nshe received the SOR.  She also testified that she broke off contact with her mother because she was\nupset over having not been informed about her father\u2019s death.\nTwo of Applicant\u2019s siblings also worked with U.S. forces in Iraq.  Two SOR allegations were\nbased upon a report by a U.S. military service intelligence command, stating that these two siblings\nhad cooperated with forces opposed to the U.S. and its allies.  Applicant testified that she was not\naware of these allegations and hoped that they were not true.  \nApplicant has no financial interests in Iraq.  She has checking and savings accounts in the\nU.S. and has expressed a willingness to renounce any dual citizenship that she has with any foreign\ncountry.  Applicant enjoys an excellent reputation for the quality of her duty performance, and her\nsupervisors describe her as loyal, honest, and trustworthy.  She is described as exceeding\nexpectations in the accomplishment of her duties.\nNumerous terrorist groups operate within Iraq, although Iraqi forces have enjoyed success\nrecently in retaking territory previously held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). \nNevertheless, there is a security vacuum in parts of Iraq.  Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may threaten\nU.S. citizens in Iraq, and the U.S. requires Government personnel to live and work under strict\nsecurity guidelines.  ISIS has committed numerous human rights abuses, and sectarian hostility has\n2\n\nweakened the Iraqi government\u2019s authority.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge found that Disqualifying Conditions 7(a) and (b)1 apply to Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances.  In concluding that Applicant had succeeded in mitigating these concerns, the Judge\ncited to Applicant\u2019s limited contact with her family during deployments, her evidence that she ceased\nall communications with her family after having received the SOR, that she has no financial interests\nin Iraq, and that her Iraqi family members do not know what she does for a living or where she lives. \nHe found credible Applicant\u2019s testimony that she did not know about her siblings\u2019 cooperation with\nforces opposed to U.S. interests, noting that the intelligence finding is more than ten years old.  The\nJudge also relied upon Applicant\u2019s character references and her long history of support for U.S.\npolicy objectives.  The Judge further cited to Applicant\u2019s years of support of the U.S. and her stated\nintent to renounce any dual citizenship that she holds.\nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate\na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nIn Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the foreign government involved, its human rights\nrecord, and the presence of terrorist activity are important considerations that provide context for the\nother record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \n1Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b): \u201ccontact . . . with a foreign family member . . . who is a citizen of\nor resident in a foreign country, if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion;\u201d and \u201cconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire\nto help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information or technology[.]\u201d\n3\n\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019).  Even a person of the highest\ncharacter can experience circumstances under which he or she could be tempted to place the well-\nbeing of foreign relatives over the interests of the U.S.  Id. at 5.   \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge failed properly to apply the disqualifying\nconditions.  She argues that the Judge should have applied Disqualifying Condition 7(d)\n(\u201ccounterintelligence information, whether classified or unclassified, that indicates the individual\u2019s\naccess to classified information . . . may involve unacceptable risk to national security.\u201d)2   \nWe find this argument to be persuasive.  Judges have wide latitude in how they write\ndecisions, and they are not expected to discuss every piece of record evidence or each of the various\ndisqualifying or mitigating conditions.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02243 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 30,\n2018); ISCR Case No. 17-02236 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).  However, a Judge should apply the\nadjudicative criteria that are fairly raised by the record evidence.  In this case, the record contains a\ndeclassified document prepared by intelligence officials working for a military department.  This\nexhibit shows that Applicant\u2019s siblings, who were working with U.S. forces in Iraq, were found to\nhave been actively cooperating with persons in Iraq who were hostile to U.S. interests.  Moreover,\nthe evidence shows that Applicant maintained regular contact with these siblings until the end of\n2017, when she received the SOR.  Taken together, this intelligence report and evidence of her\ncontact with her siblings are sufficient to raise a concern that Applicant\u2019s siblings could be a means\nthrough which Applicant comes to the attention of those interested in obtaining access to U.S.\nclassified information, thereby entailing an unacceptable risk to national security.  We conclude that\nthe evidence discussed above satisfies the criteria of Disqualifying Condition 7(d) and that the Judge\nerred by not evaluating Applicant\u2019s circumstances and her case for mitigation in light of it.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s decision fails to consider significant record\nevidence and runs counter to any reasonable interpretation of the evidence.  We find this argument\nto be persuasive.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in the record.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 18-01482 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2019).  However, the Judge cannot ignore,\ndisregard, or fail to discuss record evidence that a reasonable person could expect to be taken into\naccount in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMar. 9, 2017).\nWe note the following, drawn from the record and from the Judge\u2019s findings:\nApplicant began working for Defense contractor overseas in 2003.  At least one of her\nsiblings also began working with the U.S. military in that year.  Decision at 2; Applicant Exhibit\n(AE) I.\nIn about 2005, Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq received a letter stating that \u201cthey knew that we are\nworking and supporting the [U.S.] military and if we don\u2019t quit our job that they will burn our house\n2Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 7(d).\n4\n\nand kill the rest of my family.\u201d  AE I.\nAt least by the mid-2000s, two of Applicant\u2019s siblings were working in support of U.S.\nobjectives in Iraq.  An intelligence investigation uncovered information that these two siblings were\nin fact cooperating with forces opposed to the U.S. and other coalition members.  Government\nExhibit (GE)  4, Summary of Information, dated May 7, 2009.\nThis investigation concluded that one of the siblings had a relationship with an opposing\nmilitia leader and provided information about an upcoming military operation.  This resulted in the\n\u201ckilling of innocent people.\u201d  GE 4.\nThis sibling also threatened other contractor personnel with \u201cretribution\u201d by militia forces\nwhen they disagreed with the sibling.  GE 4.\nThe two siblings \u201cmaintained extensive contacts with numerous anti-Coalition and other\nnefarious personnel, to include Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) financiers, IED [improvised explosive\ndevices] manufacturers, kidnappers, drug smugglers, weapons dealers, . . .  and individuals wanted\nby intelligence organizations of other countries.\u201d  GE 4.\nOne of the siblings received a text message from a contact saved within her phone\u2019s address\nbook.  This message identified a named person as \u201ca spy for the Americans.\u201d  GE 4.  \nOne sibling\u2019s activity included the possession in living quarters of prohibited\ncommunications devices, such as a laptop computer, cell phone, and IPOD.  GE 4.\nWhen queried, the siblings denied any improper activity. Intelligence officials found their\ndenials to be contradicted by their own statements and by other evidence.  GE 4.\nThe intelligence investigation concluded that Applicant\u2019s two siblings were \u201cserious force\nprotection and security risks to the U.S. or Coalition personnel and installations.\u201d  GE 4.\n  Applicant performs her official duties in Iraq, spending most of her time in that country. \nIn 2016 and 2017 she spent 11 months there.  Decision at 3; Tr. at 40-41.  \nApplicant made inconsistent statements about how frequently she contacted her mother\nbefore receipt of the SOR.  In her 2016 Security Clearance Application (SCA), she stated that she\nspoke with her mother every day.  However, at the hearing, she testified that it had been much less,\nabout every three months.  SCA at 32; Tr. at 28.  She also made inconsistent statements about the\nreasons that her siblings left their employment.  In AE I, she stated that they quit the job because of\njealousy from co-workers.  However, at the hearing, she testified that the siblings were laid off.  Tr.\nat 63-64.  \nForces hostile to U.S. interests operate within Iraq.  These include sectarian militias and ISIS. \nISIS has committed numerous human rights abuses, including violence on a mass scale.  These\n5\n\nforces pose a clear danger to U.S. citizens in Iraq.  Decision at 5-6.  \nAs Department Counsel notes, there are significant omissions from the Judge\u2019s findings and\nanalysis.  For example, the Judge made no findings at all about the threatening letter that Applicant\u2019s\nfamily received as she was working in support of the U.S. military.  Clearly, an applicant who has\nalready been identified and threatened, possibly by a terrorist organization, is someone who may well \nencounter such threats in the future and thereby be pressured to compromise national security\ninformation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02862 at 4 (App. Bd. May 22, 2018).  This evidence,\nwhich is contained in one of Applicant\u2019s own exhibits, is something that a reasonable person would\nlikely expect the Judge to have addressed explicitly in the context of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation,\nand his failure to have done so undermines his favorable analysis.\nAdditionally, the Judge made no findings about the substance of GE 4, with its many detailed\nfactual conclusions drawn from the intelligence investigation of Applicant\u2019s siblings.  In fact, his\ntreatment of this matter consisted of finding credible Applicant\u2019s testimony that she was not aware\nof her siblings\u2019 conduct and that these activities occurred over ten years ago.  However, as\nDepartment Counsel argues, the security concern in this case arises not from Applicant\u2019s knowledge\nof her siblings\u2019 misconduct.  Rather, it arises from evidence that two close relatives, with whom\nApplicant spoke frequently apparently up until the end of 2017, provided protected information to\nforces opposed to the U.S., threatened other contract employees, possessed unauthorized electronic\ncommunication media in their private quarters, and gave deceptive answers about these matters when\nquestioned by intelligence personnel.  Applicant\u2019s frequent contact with her siblings over a course\nof years suggests that her relationship with them could be a means through which she comes to the\nattention of hostile persons, including those interested in acquiring U.S. protected information, even\nas she came to the attention of persons of this sort in the past.  Indeed, Applicant\u2019s siblings are\nthemselves parties who have been found hostile to the U.S. and with whom Applicant has an\nongoing familial relationship.  Moreover, the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility determination is impaired\nby Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03778 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,\n2017).  The Judge\u2019s analysis, therefore, fails to address in a meaningful way record evidence that\nentails significant security concerns and is sufficient to raise serious doubts about her susceptibility\nto pressure, coercion, or duress.  Even without reference to the Judge\u2019s failure to have applied\nDisqualifying Condition 7(d), this evidence suggests a real possibility that Applicant could be\npressured to choose foreign interests over those of the U.S. or experience a conflict of interest.  \nIn summary, Applicant has worked in Iraq for many years in support of U.S. objectives.  In\nthe mid-2000s, her family was threatened with death unless Applicant and her siblings quit their\njobs.  Two of Applicant\u2019s siblings engaged in numerous actions harmful to U.S. interests, whether\nin response to this letter or not.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with them, even if broken off after receipt\nof the SOR, suggests that she could come to the attention of persons hostile to the U.S., as she\nalready did in the recent past.  Most significantly, she has an immediate family relationship with two\npersons who have engaged in actions hostile to U.S. interests.  As noted above, the Judge failed to\nevaluate Applicant\u2019s case in light of Disqualifying Condition 7(d).  However, even under the\nDisqualifying Conditions that he did examine, Applicant\u2019s evidence that she was unaware of her\nsiblings\u2019 clandestine activities; that she hopes the investigative findings about them are not true; that\n6\n\nshe no longer speaks with them; and her excellent duty performance are not enough to mitigate a\nconcern that, once again, Applicant\u2019s service to the U.S. could become known to hostile parties and\nthat she or her family could be subjected to threats in an effort to obtain U.S. classified or protected\ninformation.    \nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision fails to consider important aspects of the\ncase and runs contrary to the record evidence.  After considering the record as a whole, we conclude\nthat the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.        \nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant eligibility for Common\nAccess Card (CAC) credentialing.  On November 9, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013Criminal, Dishonest Conduct, or Financial\nIrresponsibility concerns and Material, Intentional False Statement, Deception, or Fraud concerns,\nraised under the adjudicative standards in the appendices of DoD Instruction 5200.46 (Sep. 9, 2014)\n(Instruction).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 15, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert J. Kilmartin denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for CAC eligibility.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Instruction, Enclosure 4 \u00b6 6.\nOn September 19, 2018, we remanded the case to the Judge to correct an identified error. \nOn October 11, 2018, the Judge issued a Remand Decision in which he again denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a CAC.  Applicant appealed pursuant to DoD Directive 5220.6.  \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding that she\nhad deliberately omitted information from a Declaration for Federal Employment and whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 40-year-old severely disabled employee of a Federal contractor.  She has been\nworking for her current employer at a military installation since late 2016.  The SOR alleges several\nminor offenses or infractions, including that Applicant was charged with reckless driving in 2013;\narrested for theft by deception - passing two bad checks in 2012; arrested for giving a false name\nto a police officer and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in 2011; and arrested for\ncruelty to animals in 2010.  She admitted the reckless driving allegation, was found guilty of the bad\ncheck offenses, and was sentenced to serve 20 days in jail for the false name and drug offenses.  The\nJudge found portions of her testimony to be not credible.  She has not been arrested since 2013.  Her\ncharacter references attest to her hard work and kindness.  \nIn completing a Declaration for Federal Employment (Form 306) in 2016, Applicant\nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to the question that asked if she had been convicted, imprisoned, on probation, or\non parole in the last seven years.  She only disclosed the 2012 check offenses and 2011 arrest for\nproviding false information to a policeman.  She denied that she had deliberately omitted the other\noffenses from her form.  She attributed her omissions to forgetfulness.  The Judge found that\nApplicant had failed to list the only offense for which Applicant went to jail.   \nWith the exception of two minor charges,1 the Judge found that Applicant had not mitigated\nthe criminal and dishonest conduct concerns.  She omitted information about the most serious\noffenses from her Form 306.  The Judge did not find her explanation for the omissions to be\nforthright or candid.  She did not mitigate the material, intentional, false statement, deception, or\nfraud concerns.  In the whole-person analysis, the Judge stated that Applicant had overcome\n1 The Judge found in favor of Applicant on two harassing communication charges from 2008.  \n2\n\n\u201ctremendous physical challenges and disadvantages.\u201d  Decision at 8.  However, he concluded that\nher pattern of law violations undermined her trustworthiness; that she did not provide a meaningful\nexplanation for her omissions; and that she did not provide restitution for her bad check offenses.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief cites to new evidence, which we cannot consider.  See, e.g., CAC Case\nNo.15-06228 at 1 (App. Bd. Dec. 22, 2016).  Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that she\ndeliberately omitted material information from her Form 306.  However, the Judge\u2019s finding is a\nreasonable inference from the evidence.  The Judge\u2019s material findings are supported by substantial\nevidence.  See, e.g., CAC Case No. 16-03527 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2018).  Applicant requests that\nwe consult a web site that she claims would provide medical substantiation for her memory loss.2 \nWe have no authority to investigate a case, insofar as we have no fact-finding power.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 14-02394 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015).\nApplicant notes that the Judge cited to a provision of the Instruction that lists an individual\u2019s\nage and maturity as relevant factors in CAC adjudications.  See Instruction, Encl. 4 \u00b6 1(b)(4).  She\nargues that she developed late and was not mature at the time of her misconduct.  Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.   See, e.g., CAC Case No. 16-01524 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2018).\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s conclusion that granting Applicant CAC eligibility poses an unacceptable risk\nis sustainable on this record.\n2Applicant argues she is subject to difficulties with concentration, memory, and decision-making.  Even if the\nrecord demonstrated these difficulties, it is not clear that the result would be mitigating.  Holders of CAC eligibility may\nnot create an unacceptable risk to people or property.  Applicant\u2019s purported difficulties could diminish that\nresponsibility.\n3\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.   \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan             \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.  \n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nSeptember 6, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Department Counsel requested a hearing.  On February 7, 2019, after the hearing,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline J are not\nat issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nThe Judge made the following findings that are pertinent to the issue raised on appeal: from\n2007 to 2016, Applicant acquired seven delinquent debts, totaling over $14,000.  These were for\nmedical expenses and a consumer account.  Applicant attributed the medical debts to his wife\u2019s\nillness while he was deployed overseas.  His wife passed away, and he does not know if she ever\nsubmitted claims to the couple\u2019s medical insurer.  Applicant made no follow-up regarding the extent\nto which these debts were covered by insurance.  Applicant purchased a home with the proceeds\nfrom his wife\u2019s life insurance policy, applying none of them toward resolving his debts.  He\nprovided no evidence that he had lodged disputes of these debts, nor did he present evidence of\nefforts to contact his creditors or the credit repair firm that he had hired.  He provided no \u201chelpful\ndocumentation\u201d of steps to resolve his SOR debts.  Applicant enjoys an excellent reputation for\ncharacter, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Decision at 4.\nThough noting Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s death, the Judge concluded that he had not demonstrated\nresponsible action in regard to the debts listed in the SOR.  He also concluded that Applicant had\nnot shown that he initiated or is adhering to a good-faith effort to pay his debts.  Although his debts\nare not longer listed on his credit report, this does not demonstrate that they have actually been\nresolved in such as way a to mitigate the concerns arising from them.  All in all, Applicant has not\ndemonstrated a meaningful track record of debt resolution.\nDiscussion\nApplicant cites to record evidence that he contends that the Judge did not consider or that\nhe did not properly weigh.  This includes the circumstances under which his debts arose, his having\nhired a firm to address his debts, his contention that the medical debts should be paid by his insurer,\netc.  The Judge made findings about these things.  Applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony\nsupports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he had not met his burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 15-07062 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2017).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the\nJudge considered all of the evidence in the record.  Neither has he shown that the Judge weighed the\n2\n\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019).\nWe give due consideration to the Hearing Office case that Applicant has cited in support of\nhis effort to obtain a favorable decision.  However, Hearing Office cases are not binding on other\nHearing Office Judges or on the Appeal Board.  Each case must be decided on its own merits.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03363 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn December 3, 2018, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) Administrative Judge Gregg A.

Jul. 8, 2015).  \nThe Judge found against Applicant on eight delinquent debts and in favor of him on three\nother debts, including the sole child support allegation.  In his appeal brief, Applicant stated, \u201cI don\u2019t\nbelieve that the Judge made any mistake in his decision to revoke my clearance.

The Judge noted Applicant\u2019s military career and his status as\na graduate of a distinguished military academy.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant argues that he was not provided due process because of the\nlength of time it has taken to process his case.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT.\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July \n28, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 10, 2019, after the hearing, Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He was granted a security\nclearance in 2006.  He was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia in 1992 and for possession\nof marijuana in 1995.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on those two drug-related arrests.\nIn early 2017, Applicant smoked marijuana at a party that he attended without his wife.  Later\nthat month, he tested positive for marijuana during a random drug screening, and his employer\nsuspended him without pay.  He did not report his marijuana use before the drug test.  His employer\nallowed him to continue his employment contingent on him successfully completing a substance\nabuse program.  Shortly after completing the substance abuse program, he passed a drug test and\nreturned to work under a last-chance agreement.   \nApplicant attributed his latest drug incident to a lapse in judgment.  He indicated that he has\nno intention of using illegal drugs in the future.  He submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain\nfrom drug involvement, acknowledging that future use would be grounds to revoke his national\nsecurity eligibility.  \nAlthough Applicant presented a \u201cgood case in reform and rehabilitation,\u201d the Judge\nconcluded that he was not an acceptable security risk.  The Judge noted that Applicant used\nmarijuana as a security clearance holder who was subject to random drug tests, that such use\ndemonstrated a willingness to engage in high-risk behavior, and that such use most likely would not\nhave come to light absent the random drug test.  \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] reluctance to voluntarily self-report\nsuch adverse information further undermines his suitability for a security clearance.\u201d Decision at 6. \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  Rather\nhe challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding his security clearance suitability.  For example, he\nargues \u201c[t]he judge came to his conclusion based on a subjective opinion of my future character and\nintegrity that is contrary to my thirteen year career holding a clearance.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  In\n2\n\nsupport of his arguments, he highlights, among other matters, the duration of time that has passed\nsince his last marijuana use, his good record for protecting classified information, his honesty and\nopenness during the investigative process, and the Judge\u2019s comments that he understands the\nseriousness of the latest incident and presented a good case of reform and rehabilitation.  We do not\nfind Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive.  First, even in the absence of any security violations, the\nGovernment can deny or revoke access to classified information based on the existence of facts and\ncircumstances that indicate an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 99-0462 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000).  Second, the conclusions of DOHA Judges are\noften subjective in nature.  As we have noted in the past, security clearance decisions are not an exact\nscience but rather are predictive judgments about a person's security suitability in light of that\nperson's past conduct and present circumstances.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-11489 at 4 (App. Bd.\nSep. 11, 2003), citing Department of Navy v. Egan , 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  From our review\nof the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a security concern in this case are\nbased on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).  Third, Applicant\u2019s\narguments essentially amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  The\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security\nclearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 16-00276 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2017).  \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The record\nsupports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

We cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief also claims there are two errors in the hearing transcript. \nSpecifically, she claims the transcript incorrectly reflects the acronym of the entity from which she\nreceived credit counseling and incorrectly reflects the year in which she started that counseling. \nBecause she stated that she was responsible for the mistake pertaining to the acronym, no relief for\nthat error is warranted on appeal.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15148 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.\n25, 2013).  In this regard, we note the Judge based her decision primarily on Applicant\u2019s failure to\nact responsibly in addressing the credit card debt.    \n2\n\nAs best we can discern, Applicant also contends that the Judge did not consider all of the\nrecord evidence and mis-weighed the evidence.  For example, she asserts that the credit card debt\nwas due to the creditor\u2019s criminal activity, that she experienced periods of unemployment while\nworking on Federal contracts, that she exercised good judgment in handling her financial matters,\nand that the credit card debt has been removed from her credit reports.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nChristopher D. Thomas, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 13, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On March 29, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred by admitting\nevidence of conduct that had been addressed during a prior clearance adjudication; whether the Judge\nerred in finding that Applicant had deliberately made false statements or omissions; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable\nfindings under Guideline F are not at issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judges\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant joined the U.S. military after graduating from high school.  Stationed at a location\nnear his parents, he lived with them.  Applicant\u2019s mother suffered from health problems, and he\nrequested leave in order to care for her.  His request was denied, but he stayed behind with his\nmother rather than report for deployment to another country, remaining in AWOL status for about\nsix years.  In 2006, he returned to duty and was court-martialed, receiving a bad conduct discharge.\nApplicant began working for a Defense contractor in 2010.  He received a security clearance\nthe next year.  In 2013, while married and while holding a clearance, Applicant became romantically\ninvolved with a woman from Taiwan.  In June 2013, he traveled to Taiwan to visit her, and he\nsubmitted a travel request that his employer required for foreign travel.  In this request, Applicant\nfalsely stated that he was going to Taiwan with his wife, and he also failed to receive a required\ntravel briefing.  Applicant remained away from his job longer than his scheduled period of approved\nleave, advising his employer that he had missed his return flight.  In fact, he intentionally missed the\nflight so that he could remain in Taiwan longer with the woman with whom he was conducting an\naffair.  As a result, Applicant was AWOL from his employment for about five days.  \nWhen questioned by a Government official about his relationship with the Taiwanese\nwoman, Applicant stated that he would not be seeing her again.  After that, however, the woman\ncame to visit Applicant in the U.S. for about six weeks.  He failed to report this visit to the\nappropriate security authorities at his place of employment.  \nWhen completing his security clearance application (SCA) in 2016, Applicant did not\ndisclose a judgment against him, delinquent student loans in significant amounts, and accounts that\nhad been placed in collection status.  His \u201cno\u201d answers to the questions at issue were false. \nA co-worker found Applicant to be reliable and trustworthy.  His job performance\nevaluations generally rate him as \u201cconsistently meets standards.\u201d  A friend commended Applicant\u2019s\nhonesty, loyalty, and integrity.\n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThough noting that Applicant\u2019s military AWOL occurred several years in the past, the Judge\nstated that his poor decision-making persisted in the intervening years.  She also found Applicant\u2019s\ncredibility to be questionable.  The Judge noted, for example, that he was not truthful concerning his\naffair with the Taiwanese women and that he deliberately lied to his employer on more than one\noccasion.  She also stated that he deliberately failed to disclose his debts, citing to the extent of his\ndelinquent student loans as a reason to believe that Applicant was aware of them at the time he\ncompleted his SCA.  \u201cThe fact that he did not list these loans in response to questions on his\napplication, shows that he was either extremely careless, or he deliberately concealed the information\nfrom the Government, which in either case indicates questionable judgment, unreliability, and\nuntrustworthiness[.]\u201d Decision at 7.\nIn the whole-person analysis, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s having held a clearance for several\nyears.  She stated, however, that he was neither young nor naive, reiterating her findings that he lied\non his SCA about his debts and that he lied to his employer in order to conceal material information\nabout his extramarital affair.  \u201cThis is not an individual . . .  whom the Government can be confident\n. . .  will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking.\u201d \nDecision at 9.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred by admitting evidence of his AWOL while in the\nmilitary and of the resulting court-martial.  These things were considered during an earlier clearance\ninvestigation, and he believes that the doctrine of res judicata prevents them from being addressed\nduring his current one.  We do not find Applicant\u2019s arguments to be persuasive.  While res judicata\nhas some applicability in DOHA cases, the Government is never estopped from considering matters\nfrom a prior adjudication, especially when, as in the case before us, there is subsequent misconduct. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08806 at 4 (App. Bd. May 8, 2007).  In this case, Applicant went\nAWOL from his job in 2013 and made numerous false statements to his employers about his\ncircumstances.  That he did so despite having received a punitive discharge for a six-year incident\nof AWOL several years earlier was a matter that the Judge was entitled to consider in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s case for mitigation and rehabilitation.  The Judge did not err by admitting and\nconsidering evidence of Applicant\u2019s earlier misconduct.\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in finding that he had made deliberate false statements\nto his employer as well as on his SCA.  He contends that, at worst, he was negligent in failing to\nnotify his employer about his travel plans and that he relied on his wife to pay bills and, therefore,\ndid not know about the extent of his debts.  However, Government Exhibit 3, a U.S. Government\nMemorandum, dated October 1, 2014, contained a transcription of Applicant\u2019s interview with a\nGovernment agent from September 26, 2013, in which he admitted that he was not truthful during\na security interview concerning his 2013 travel to Taiwan.  In addition, Applicant acknowledged on\ncross examination that he told his employer \u201clies\u201d and was deceitful about his travel to Taiwan and\nabout his relationship with the Taiwanese woman.  Tr. at 137-140.  \n3\n\nRegarding Applicant\u2019s omissions from his SCA, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate\nfalsification is supported by evidence that Applicant was aware of his financial problems at the time\nhe completed his SCA, as well as by the multiple nature of his false statements, which in and of itself\ncan give rise to a conclusion of deliberate misconduct.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08163 at 5 (App.\nBd. Oct. 25, 2017).  We note the Judge\u2019s comment that if Applicant did not lie on his SCA he was\nat least extremely negligent, which might appear to qualify her conclusion about his mens rea.  In\nthe first place, the Directive provides that \u201cany failure . . . to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring national security investigative . . . processes\u201d can raise questions about a person\u2019s eligibility\nfor a clearance.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A\u00b6 15 (emphasis added).  It does not expressly limit the\nconcern to deliberately false statements only.  In  the second place, viewing the decision as a whole,\nwe conclude that the Judge treated the SCA omissions as deliberate failures to disclose material\ninformation, as, for example in her whole-person analysis.  The Judge\u2019s various findings about\nApplicant\u2019s falsifications and omissions are supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable\nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the\nsame record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See also ISCR Case No. 18-01564 at 3 (App. Bd. May 30,\n2019).\nApplicant cites to his favorable evidence and argues that the Judge erred in evaluating his\ncase for mitigation.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the\nevidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04112 at 2 (App. Bd. May 28, 2019).  A\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the record is not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner\nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02250 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMay 23, 2019). \nApplicant asks if he can be given the \u201cbenefit of the doubt.\u201d (Appeal brief at 3). We are\ninstructed as follows: \u201cany doubt shall be resolved in favor of the national security.\u2019  Directive, Encl.\n2 \u00b6 E.4.\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

In 2010, the IRS audited Applicant for 2006 and 2007 and found he and his wife owed $129,000 in unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn November 6, 2018,, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased against\nApplicant; whether the Judge utilized an improper standard in making his findings of fact; whether\nthe Judge abused his discretion in amending the SOR; whether the Judge denied Applicant due\nprocess; whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant is the president of a Defense contractor.  He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and is an\nordained minister.  Applicant has held a secret clearance since 2005.  He also has held a top secret\nclearance with access to sensitive compartmented information in the past.  He is married and has\nfour adopted children.\nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges that he failed to pay his Federal taxes for 2010 through 2013 and\nfor 2015; that he failed to pay his state taxes for 2010 through 2015; and that he is indebted to the\nFederal Government for six tax liens secured against him in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.  The total\namount of the alleged liens is nearly $204,000.  Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, and\nthe Judge incorporated these admissions into his findings.1  \nApplicant attributed his tax delinquencies to several factors: his company has struggled\nthrough the years; his wife has experienced serious health problems; Appellant\u2019s wife lost income\nas a realtor during the poor housing market; he lost rental income on property that he owned; he\nreceived poor tax advice from his accountants; and the adoption of his children took two years\nlonger than anticipated.  His loss of income, failure to pay payroll taxes in a timely manner, and\nfailure to maintain monthly payments under installment agreements eventually led the IRS to cancel\nthose agreements and file liens.\nAlthough Applicant failed to pay his tax obligations as due, he filed his Federal returns in\na timely fashion, except for tax year 2016.  He eventually filed his 2016 return several days after the\nhearing.  The IRS initially rejected this return due to errors but finally accepted it in August 2018.\n1During the hearing, the Judge amended the SOR to include an allegation that Applicant failed to file his 2016\nincome tax returns in a timely manner.  Tr. at 81-83.  Applicant neither admitted nor denied this additional allegation. \nSee below for discussion of Applicant\u2019s assignment of error on this matter.\n2\n\nFor all of the years in question, except for 2014, Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income was about\n$200,000 or more.  His AGI for 2014 was about $85,500.  As stated above, Applicant had an\ninstallment agreement with the IRS, who cancelled it after Applicant failed to make a required\npayment.  Applicant presented some documentary evidence in corroboration of his claim to have\nmade payments over $44,000 under this agreement.\nApplicant made an offer in compromise to the IRS, but the agency rejected it.  Applicant\nclaimed that he had made $16,000 in payments during that time, but he only corroborated about\n$14,500.  Applicant entered into another payment plan covering 2010 through 2013.  He made only\ntwo payments under the plan because a client stopped paying him.  During this time, Applicant\u2019s\nbalance due to the IRS for 2010 through 2013 increased to nearly $118,000.  Applicant stated that\nas of August 2018 his unpaid individual income taxes totaled nearly $154,000 for 2010 through\n2013 and 2015.  However, at the hearing he testified that his 2010 through 2013 taxes had been paid\nand that only his debts for 2014 and 2015 remained due, both of which were covered under an\ninstallment agreement.  \nRegarding the liens entered against him, Applicant told his clearance interviewer that he had\nnot been aware of any liens at the time he completed his security clearance application (SCA). \nHowever, this contention is not consistent with the contents of his installment agreements, which\nshow that liens had already been filed.  These agreements predate the SCA.  Applicant contended\nthat he had disputed some of his liens with the IRS but did not corroborate that claim.  Applicant\nalso failed to corroborate his claim to have resolved his state tax obligation.  He  did present\nevidence of an installment agreement, dated January 2018, showing a balance owed of nearly\n$17,000.  He did present evidence of six payments under this agreement.\nApplicant also has other delinquent debts, such as a mortgage, credit card, automobile loan,\nand medical expenses.  Has paid off most of the $38,480 that these debts amount to.  In addition, he\nowns a residence where his mother lives and pays about $600 a month toward the mortgage.  His\nfinancial statement shows that he has a net monthly income of about $15,500, with about $800 left\nafter ordinary expenses.  There is no evidence that he has received financial counseling.  He failed\nto provide corroboration for his testimony about the various causes underlying his financial\nproblems.  However, as noted above, Applicant\u2019s gross income has almost consistently exceeded\n$200,000.  He found that his claims about his wife\u2019s loss of income is unsupported by documentary\ncorroboration, as is his testimony about lost rental income and poor advice from accountants.  \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for his duty performance, knowledge, and\nexperience.  He recently received an award for his \u201cconsistent record of excellence.\u201d  Decision at\n8.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s tax problems raised the following concerns: inability \nto satisfy debts, unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; a history of not meeting\n3\n\nfinancial obligations; and failure to file and pay taxes when due.2  He further concluded that\nApplicant had not met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  He noted that Applicant\u2019s unpaid\ndebts are ongoing and, therefore, recent.  He also reiterated his finding that Applicant had not\ncorroborated his testimony about the causes of his problems or his efforts to resolve them.  The\nJudge stated that, as president of a corporation, Applicant was charged with understanding the\nvarious financial requirements that went with the position.  Applicant had a significant income for\nthe years in question, and yet his difficulties are still unresolved.  The Judge cited to his finding that\nApplicant had not received financial guidance, and he also concluded that Applicant\u2019s payment\nhistory does not equate to a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.  He also stated that inability to pay\ntaxes is not an excuse for having failed to file his 2016 return on time.  He concluded that\nApplicant\u2019s recent efforts at addressing his tax problems suggest that he has done so simply because\nhis clearance is in jeopardy and that Applicant\u2019s evidence, viewed as a whole, amounts to a promise\nto resolve his debts in the future, which is not enough to establish mitigation.\nIn the whole-person analysis the Judge stated that Applicant had established \u201can extremely\npoor track record of debt reduction . . .  until well after the SOR was issued.\u201d   \u201cOverall, the\nevidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability\nfor a security clearance.\u201d  Id. at 15.\nDiscussion\nBias\nApplicant contends that the Judge was biased against him.  He cites to various aspects of the\nrecord which be believes demonstrate that the Judge was not impartial.  A Judge is presumed to be\nunbiased and a party who alleges otherwise has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02391 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018).  Bias involves partiality for or against a\nparty, predisposition to decide a case or issue without regard to the merits, or other indicia of a lack\nof impartiality.  ISCR Case No. 12-09421 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 15, 2017).    \nAmong the things that Applicant asserts in support of this assignment of error is the claim\nthat the Judge directed him to present evidence from which the Judge later drew unfavorable\nconclusions.  Applicant is referring to a portion of the hearing in which Department Counsel\nquestioned him about his yearly income.  Applicant did not provide a clear answer, and his counsel\nexpressed a concern that Applicant was being required to \u201cdo math in his head on the stand.\u201d  Tr.\nat 79.  At this point, the Judge interjected, proposing that the issue could be resolved if he could have\nthe first two pages of every income tax return for the years in question.  He advised that he did not\nneed \u201cthe rest of the stuff,\u201d meaning the entire tax documents, only those that would address the\nmatter of Applicant\u2019s income.  Id.  In the end the Judge concluded that this evidence showed that\nApplicant had sufficient income to have resolved his financial problems.  \n2Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 18 (a-c, f).\n4\n\nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal, on this record we construe the Judge\u2019s motive\nin seeking the tax returns to have been an effort to clarify the evidence on a material point rather\nthan to hobble Applicant in his effort to establish mitigation or otherwise to place an undue burden\nupon him.3  We have examined the other things that Applicant has cited as evidence of bias and\nconclude that they constitute rulings, interpretations of the record, findings, etc., with which\nApplicant is dissatisfied.  A party cannot demonstrate bias merely by showing that the Judge ruled\nagainst him or her.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017);  See also\nBixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751 at 762 (10th Cir. 2010).  Applicant has directed our attention to\nnothing that would likely persuade a reasonable person that the Judge was lacking in the requisite\nimpartiality.\n \nImproper Standard for Making Findings\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not utilize the proper standard in making findings and\ndrawing conclusions therefrom.  Noting the Judge\u2019s comments that he had not corroborated his\ntestimony about the difficult circumstances underlying his financial problems or about his effort at\nrepayment, Appellant argues that the Judge, in effect, wrongfully denied to his testimony the status\nof evidence.  We construe this argument to mean that the Judge did not comply with the criteria set\nforth in the Directive for making and evaluating findings of fact.  \nThe standard that we use in evaluating the sufficiency of a Judge\u2019s findings is set forth in\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1:   \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  See ISCR Case No.\n17-02145 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).  Of course, testimony is evidence and, in an appropriate\ncase, it can support sustainable findings on its own.  However, it is not unreasonable for a Judge to\nexpect an applicant to corroborate his claims that he has mitigated the concerns set forth in an SOR. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07062 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2017).  In a DOHA proceeding, the\napplicant bears the burden of persuasion that he or she should have access to classified information,\nand corroborating evidence can go a long way toward enabling an applicant to meet that burden. \nIn the case before us, the Judge did in fact make findings drawn from Applicant\u2019s testimony. \nHowever, he apparently did not find Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated assertions to be sufficiently\ncredible so as to satisfy the mitigating conditions set forth in the Directive, and we are required to\ngive deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Moreover, a Judge\nis not required to give conclusive weight to any kind of evidence, even if it is un-rebutted.4  The\nJudge did not contravene the Directive in making his findings of fact. \n3By stating or implying that a party should not present certain evidence, the Judge runs the risk of infringing\non a party\u2019s responsibility to present evidence.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E.3.1.14. and E.3.1.15.\n4See ISCR Case No. 98-0592 at 5 (App. Bd. May 4, 1999): A \u201cJudge must consider the record as a whole and\nuse common sense . . . in evaluating the absence of corroborating evidence.\u201d  This case quotes ISCR Case No. 98-0265\nat 4, n.2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 1999): An \u201cAdministrative Judge is not required to accept unrebutted evidence uncritically\nor without considering it in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  \n \n5\n\nSOR Amendment\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in amending the SOR.    \nThe SOR may be amended at the hearing by the Administrative Judge on his own\nmotion, or upon motion by Department Counsel or the applicant, so as to render it\nin conformity with the evidence . . . When such amendments are made, the\nAdministrative Judge may grant either party\u2019s request for such additional time as the\nAdministrative Judge may deem appropriate for further preparation or other good\ncause. [ Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17.] \nWe review a Judge\u2019s decision to amend an SOR for an abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n14-00019 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2014).\nAs noted above, evidence was adduced at the hearing that Applicant had not filed his 2016\nFederal income tax return in a timely fashion.  Tr. at 35-37; Applicant Exhibit (AE) Y.  Department\nCounsel moved to amend the SOR to add an allegation to that effect, the SOR being silent on the\npoint.  The Judge overruled Applicant\u2019s objection and granted the motion.  Tr. at 81-83.  At the close\nof the hearing, Applicant requested three months in which to address the new allegation.  The Judge\nheld the record open from August 9, 2018, the date of the hearing, until September 27, 2018.  Tr.\nat 94.  Accordingly, the amendment was founded upon evidence that was properly before the Judge,\nand it rendered the SOR in conformity therewith.  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s decision to grant\nApplicant less additional time than he requested, although he allowed him well over a month and\na half after the hearing to present evidence in mitigation of the new allegation.  The Judge did not\nabuse his discretion in amending the SOR.\nRemaining Issues\nWe find no support for Applicant\u2019s contention that the Judge improperly limited his ability\nto present evidence in mitigation.  Neither do we conclude that the Judge made improper use of the\nnon-alleged conduct noted in his findings.  A Judge may consider non-alleged conduct on such\nthings as evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, performing a whole-person analysis, and\nmaking a credibility determination.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16,\n2017).  Applicant was not denied the due process that the Directive affords.\nThe Judge did not err in finding that Applicant had not received financial counseling.  The\nrecord does not support Applicant\u2019s argument that, under the facts of this case, his use of a CPA\nsatisfied the requirements of Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(c).  After reviewing the record, we\nconclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute\nreasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the record.  Applicant has not\nidentified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.  Considering the record\nevidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 16-02640 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).\n6\n\nApplicant\u2019s brief is, to a large extent, a challenge to the manner in which the Judge weighed\nthe evidence.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to\nargue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).  A person who fails to file\ntax returns and pay taxes when due does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and\nreliability required of those granted access to classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n01256 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018).  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nAugust 29, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant  requested a hearing. \nOn October 12, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree and requires a clearance as a condition of his current\nemployment by a Defense contractor.  He is married with two grown children.  Applicant has\nnumerous delinquent debts.  The ones that the Judge found against him were for credit card accounts\nand a line of credit provided by a bank.  Applicant attributed his financial problems to several\ncauses\u2013his failure to monitor spending or maintain a budget; his having refinanced his home to pay\noff credit card debt; and his mismanagement of an inheritance that he received upon the death of his\nmother.  \nApplicant sought the assistance of an attorney to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on his\nbehalf.  Accordingly, he stopped paying on credit cards, as they were to be included in the\nbankruptcy petition.  Applicant\u2019s attorney did not file a petition, however, because he \u201ckept trying\nto figure out the right formula.\u201d  Decision at 5.  Subsequently Applicant discovered a means of debt\nresolution propounded by a radio personality.  He began selling some of his assets in order to build\nup a cash emergency fund, and he sold off a vehicle.  However, he still did not have enough funds\nto pay off his credit card debts. \nAlthough Applicant stated on more than one occasion that he would pay all of his debts, as\nof the close of the record he had failed to do so.  For example, he claimed that he would resolve his\nlargest account, a credit card debt for nearly $23,000, by withdrawing from his retirement fund, but\nhe provided no evidence that this debt had been paid or settled.  Neither did he demonstrate\nresolution of two relatively small credit card accounts.  He did present evidence that the creditor of\na $4500 charged-off account had forgiven $3,472 and that he testified that he had paid taxes on this\namount.  In the Analysis, however, the Judge stated that it was not clear from the record whether\nApplicant still owed some portion of the debt that might be attributable to interest or penalties. \nApplicant self-reported his financial problems to his employer, and he has handled classified\ninformation properly.  A supervisor from a previous job recommended him for a clearance, provided\nhe addresses his financial situation.\n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s circumstances raised three disqualifying conditions:\ninability to satisfy debts, a history of not meeting financial obligations, and consistent\noverspending.1  Regarding four debts, including the largest addressed above, she concluded that\nApplicant had not demonstrated mitigation.  She noted that creditors were willing to settle, although\nApplicant did not have on hand sufficient funds to make even the reduced amounts.  She stated that\nApplicant does not have pending settlement offers or plans.  She noted Applicant\u2019s evidence that\nhis difficulties were, in large part, due to his having failed to budget his expenses, his reliance upon\ncredit cards, etc.  She also noted evidence that Applicant had engaged in new spending by using\ndiscretionary funds that could have been directed toward debt payment.  In the whole-person\nanalysis, the Judge acknowledged that Applicant had properly handled classified information while\nundergoing financial difficulties.  She stated, however, that once a security concern arises, there is\na strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a clearance.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant argues that he has resolved all of his debts.  His argument includes assertions from\noutside the record, which we cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  In any event, even if debts have\nbeen resolved a Judge may still consider the underlying circumstances for what they may reveal\nabout the applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02246 at 2 (App. Bd.\nDec. 8, 2017).  He cites to aspects of the record that he contends are favorable to him, such as his\nefforts at debt settlement, the debt that the creditor forgave, his full disclosure of his financial\nproblems to his employer, his credit reports which he argues show that his debts have been resolved,\nand his good security record.  On this last point, the government need not wait until an individual\nmishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before it can make an unfavorable security\nclearance decision.  Even those with good prior records can encounter circumstances in which their\njudgment and reliability might be compromised.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07941 at 2 (App. Bd.\nNov. 29, 2018).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the\nevidence in the record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Id.  Applicant cites to a portion of his clearance interview\nsummary which states that he cannot be blackmailed or coerced due to his financial difficulties. \nHowever, this represents the interviewer\u2019s summary of Applicant\u2019s answers, not the interviewer\u2019s\nindependent judgment as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance.  Even if it did represent the\ninterviewer\u2019s opinion it would not bind the Government in evaluating Applicant\u2019s case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 15-03995 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 24, 2017).        \nGiven Applicant\u2019s history of overspending and evidence that as of the close of the record he\nstill had not resolved his delinquent debts, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s overall adverse\nconclusion.  The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation\nfor the decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nDecember 1, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline M (Use of\nInformation Technology), and Guideline K (Handling Protected Information) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn February 11, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant was terminated from a previous employment.  The reasons for this termination\nwere that he installed unauthorized software on his work computer; created five \u201cadministrative\naccounts,\u201d some in the names of co-workers, on a classified system without obtaining approval; and\nfalsified his time card over a seven-day period, during which he spent the majority of his time on\nnon-work related activities.  Applicant claimed that he did not know that the software he installed\nwas not authorized and that he had authority to create the administrative accounts.  He did not\ncorroborate these assertions.  Applicant submitted five letters of support, but none of them shed light\nupon his misconduct.  \nThe Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s security-significant conduct was intentional, unauthorized,\nand occurred within two and a half years prior to the hearing.  He noted Applicant\u2019s falsified time\ncards and other misconduct, stating that he showed little or no remorse.  Though noting evidence\nthat Applicant is well-respected in his current job, he found that the record left him with questions\nand doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider, or that he mis-weighed, favorable record\nevidence, such as his claim that he had approval for some of his conduct and that his conduct\noccurred over two years prior to the hearing.  He argues that his infractions were relatively minor\nand that he had not been properly trained.  Applicant takes exception to the Judge\u2019s comments that\nhe had acted intentionally and that he lacked remorse, thereby challenging the Judge\u2019s adverse\ncredibility determination.  On this last point, we give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility\ndetermination.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  The evidence, which includes his prior employer\u2019s written\nsummary of the things that led to his firing, support the challenged finding.  Indeed, the number of\ninfractions suggest that they were not merely inadvertent or negligent.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n08163 at 5 (App.  Bd. Oct. 25, 2017) (Multiple false statements support a finding of intentional\nmisbehavior).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the\nevidence in the record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15,\n2\n\n2019).  We give due consideration to the Hearing Office case that Applicant has cited.  However,\nHearing Office cases are not binding on other Hearing Office Judges or on the Appeal Board.  Each\ncase must be adjudicated on its own merits.  The cited case does not provide a reason to conclude\nthat the Judge erred in his analysis or conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03363 at 3 (App.\nBd. Nov. 29, 2018).\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

On\nOctober 17, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nDecember 6, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Braden M. Murphy denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Government failed to establish\nthe sole SOR allegation and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is 37 years old, served honorably in the military for about five years.  He is\nmarried, has one child, and his wife is expecting another.   Since earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in\n2009, he has worked for Federal contractors with some periods of unemployment.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was terminated from a defense contractor position in 2016\nfor falsifying his timecards.

In 2016, he was required to complete\nten on-line training courses for one employer that was expected to take a total of about 25 hours to\ncomplete.  He requested to complete these self-paced courses during a 40-hour work week (October\n3-7) while teleworking from home.  His supervisors noted Applicant erroneously billed the 40-hours\non his timecard as overhead rather than training, but he later changed it to reflect eight hours of\ntraining for each of those days.\nIn reviewing the course materials, the supervisors noted that Applicant started and completed\nonly two courses on two of those workdays and that he logged into the training program for only 2\nhours and 15 minutes.  When his supervisors confronted him about this apparent discrepancy,\nApplicant stated that he conducted eight hours of training on all five days but was unable to explain\nthe incongruity.  Applicant offered to change his timecard to reflect 40-hours of personal time off\nand was told to resubmit an accurate time card.  He resubmitted the timecard so that it reflected 25\nhours of training and 15 hours of personal time.  The supervisors decided that Applicant had a\nsufficient opportunity to be truthful and recommended he be terminated.  The human resources (HR)\noffice later issued a memorandum noting Applicant routinely reported working 40 hours but his\nbadge swipes showed a patten of working fewer hours and coworker corroborated that he often left\nearly.  His employer subsequently terminated him.\nApplicant denied that he falsified his timecards.  He claimed his immediate supervisor gave\nhim permission to submit a timecard reflecting 25 hours of training and thought there was a lack of\ncommunication between the immediate supervisor and the next-level supervisor.  Instead of\nwatching the training videos and then taking the associated test, he claims he worked the whole\nweek, first watching all the training videos, and then taking all the tests at the end of the week.  He\n2\n\ncontends that he received credit for only a few hours of training because he just passed two or three\nof the tests and did not receive credit for taking tests he did not pass. \nBefore the hearing, Applicant reached out to his former supervisor to confirm his claims. \nThe former supervisor had been advised to refer Applicant back to the HR office, which Applicant\ndid without success.  He sought to subpoena the former supervisor to testify, but was advised the\nJudge did not have authority to subpoena witnesses.   He continues to work for the other defense\ncontractor and received a favorable 2018 mid-term review.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n\u201cGE 3, GE 4, and GE 5 are company business records establishing that Applicant was\nterminated [in late 2016] for what the company concluded was falsification of his timecards.  An\nemployer\u2019s characterization of events underlying an adverse action are entitled to some deference.1\nApplicant\u2019s disagreement with the reasons for his termination is not enough to overcome that\npresumption.\u201d  Decision at 8.   Applicant\u2019s assertion that his supervisor told him to change his\ntimecard to reflect 25 hours of training is simply not credible.  His testimony that he was not credited\nfor logging in for tests he failed is not credible.  No personal conduct mitigating conditions apply. \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29. \nApplicant asserts that the Judge \u201cgave deference to the Government, raising concerns of Due\nProcess\u201d and established one standard for the Government and another for him for presenting\nevidence.  Appeal Brief at 1-2.  To the extent that he is arguing the Judge is biased, we do not find\nthis contention persuasive.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a judge is impartial and unbiased,\nand a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 17-00661 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 7, 2018).   We find nothing in the record either to persuade\na reasonable person that the Judge lacked impartiality or to show the Judge applied different\nstandards to the parties for presenting evidence.  Applicant has failed to met his heavy burden of\npersuasion to establish bias.  Both parties were provided an equal opportunity to present evidence\nsupporting their cases.\n  \nApplicant contends the Government failed to present evidence establishing he falsified his\ntimecard by stating \u201cthe Government never presented any \u2018evidence\u2019 raising security concerns but\nmade allegation without any supporting documentation\u201d and  \u201ccompany records . . . should be\nconsidered allegations not evidence.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  He also notes he did not have the\nopportunity to cross-examine witnesses and asserts his former company could have furnished\n1 The Judge cited two Appeal Board decision for this proposition, i.e., ISCR Case No. 14-00114 at 3 (App. Bd.\nSep. 30, 2014)(citing ISCR Case No. 10-03886 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 26, 2012). \n3\n\ndocuments, such as computer logs or training records, to support their claim, but did not do so. \nThese contentions lack merit.  A Judge\u2019s findings must be supported by substantial evidence, i.e.,\n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in\nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See also, ISCR Case\nNo. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018).  In this case, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s timecard\nfalsification was based on business records (GE 3, GE 4, and GE 5), which are an admissible form\nof evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule.  See, Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and Federal Rule of\nEvidence 803(6).  See also, ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).  Moreover, an\napplicant\u2019s right to confrontation is not violated by admission of documents that fall within well-\nestablished exceptions to the hearsay rule, such as the business records exception.  Id.2  Furthermore,\nthe Directive does not require either party to present specific types of evidence, such as computer\nlogs, to prove controverted facts.  Finally, business records need not be independently corroborated\nto be admissible into evidence.  In this case, the Judge\u2019s material findings were based on substantial\nevidence.  Applicant has failed to establish he was not afforded the due process rights afforded him\nunder the Directive.  \nApplicant also notes that the Judge highlighted his failure to corroborate his testimony, while\nthe Government did not corroborate the business records that it offered into evidence.  This\nargument, in essence, is a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  In this regard,\nApplicant also cites to his military service, educational and athletic achievements, family situation,\nand other accomplishments.  However, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).\nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Enclosure\n2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nA security clearance decision must be based upon a reasonable interpretation of the record\nevidence viewed as a cumulative whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-04813 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 31,\n2015).  A Judge is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in the record.  However, a Judge\nshould not ignore significant record evidence that a reasonable person would expect  to be addressed. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017).  Department Counsel argues that\nthe Judge\u2019s decision did not devote attention to significant contrary evidence.  She argues that the\ndecision is not sustainable because it runs contrary to the greater weight of the evidence.  \nWe find Department Counsel\u2019s argument to be persuasive.  We note the following findings\nand /or record evidence that undercut the Judge\u2019s favorable decision:\nApplicant engaged the services of prostitutes over a period of several years.  Decision\nat 2-3; Response to SOR at 1; Tr. at 39.\nApplicant was first approved for a clearance in 2008.  Government Exhibit (GE) 1,\n2017 Security Clearance Application at 38.  He engaged prostitutes about eleven\ntimes between 2010 and 2014.  Tr. at 39.  Therefore, many of these incidents took\nplace while Applicant held a clearance.\nAlthough most of the incidents occurred in foreign countries where such conduct was\nlegal, one of them occurred in the U.S., where it was illegal.  Decision at 3; Tr. at 40,\n80.\n3\n\nApplicant did not disclose this U.S. offense in his 2017 SCA.  Decision at 4; GE 1\nat 38.  The offense in the U.S. is the only one which Applicant understood to have\nbeen illegal.  Decision at 4.\nApplicant has not disclosed his prostitution offenses to his wife, because he is\nconcerned about the effect it will have on her.  Tr. at 48.  \nApplicant engaged in a six-month extramarital affair, of which his wife is aware. \nDecision at 4; Tr. at 89.    \nHowever, Applicant did not disclose this affair during the October 2014 polygraph\nexamination.  He did disclose it during the post-test interview following a subsequent\npolygraph.  He stated that the reason that he had not disclosed it in 2014 was that\n\u201c[he] was afraid that it would [a]ffect his security processing, and [he] was\nembarrassed.\u201d Polygraph Report dated March 3, 2015, included in GE 3.  \n  This evidence demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s alleged sexual behavior occurred while he held\na clearance; that it included an incident that was illegal in the U.S. jurisdiction where it occurred;\nand that he failed to be totally candid about his security-significant offenses during the investigation\nand adjudication of his case.  We find persuasive Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable decision failed adequately to address this evidence as a whole.  In particular, we note that\nthe Judge did not address Applicant\u2019s admission that, during his 2014 polygraph, he had withheld\ninformation about his affair because he was afraid of the affect it might have on his access to\nclassified information.  The Directive is clear that it is of special concern for an applicant to fail to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the processing of an SCA.  It also states that \u201c[t]he\nfollowing will normally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination . . . : (b)\nrefusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security\nofficials, or other official representatives in connection with a personnel security . . . determination.\u201d \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 15.  Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s failure to have admitted his six-month\naffair until it was discovered during the course of a subsequent polygraph examination raises serious\nconcerns about his willingness to disclose security-significant conduct.  This was a matter that the\nJudge should have addressed forthrightly.  \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s many years of utilizing prostitutes, incidents that he has not admitted\nto his wife because he is not sure how she will respond, raise reasonable concerns about his\njudgment and the extent to which he could be subjected to undue influence or coercion.1  Of course,\nthe Judge was required to consider Applicant\u2019s character evidence and his explanations for his\nmisconduct.  In addition, we give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1.  However, that deference has its limits.  When a Judge fails to address record evidence\n1See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 12: \u201cThe Concern:  Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects\na lack of judgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, exploitation, or duress. \nThese issues, together or individually, may raise questions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness,\nand ability to protect classified of sensitive information.\u201d  \n4\n\nthat is contrary to his favorable credibility determination, it provides a serious reason to believe that\nhe has simply substituted a favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05565 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2017).  In this case, the totality of\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct\u2013especially his omission of material information during his 2014 polygraph\ndue to concern over its effect on his clearance\u2013persuades us that the Judge\u2019s credibility determination\nis not entitled to the deference that we normally extend to such conclusions.  \nGiven the above, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision fails to consider relevant factors and\nruns contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  In light of the totality of the evidence, we\nconclude that the Judge erred in finding that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion as to\nmitigation.  \nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan             \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

On\nAugust 25, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On October 3, 2018, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider all of\nthe evidence in the record and whether the Judge applied the wrong standard in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s case, rendering his decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists several delinquent credit card accounts and three judgments, two of\nwhich he has paid.  Applicant operated a business from 2006 to 2016, which did not succeed,\nespecially in 2014 and later.  He had difficulty paying bills.  Applicant enrolled in debt relief firms. \nHe was not able to make the required payments under the earlier one, and he provided no\ninformation about the status of the other.  Aside from the two judgments that he has paid, Applicant\nsubmitted no evidence of payment on his SOR debts.  He presented no evidence of a budget or of\nhis spending practices.\nGiven the extent of Applicant\u2019s remaining debts, it is likely that his financial problems will\ncontinue into the future.  Although his business failure was a circumstance beyond his control,\nApplicant has not demonstrated responsible action in regard to his delinquent debts.  He has satisfied\nonly two of his SOR debts, even though he has been fully employed since 2016.  He has never had\nfinancial counseling, and, though his debt programs refer to credit counseling, there is no evidence\nas to what this consisted of.  Applicant has not presented meaningful evidence of debt resolution. \nHe is not required to have paid off all debts in the SOR, but he should have a plan to pay his debts,\nsupported by evidence that he is implementing that plan.\nDiscussion\nApplicant has submitted exhibits which were not part of the record.  The Board may not\nconsider new evidence.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, in particular\ninformation provided in his Answer to the SOR about his having prioritized payment of non-SOR\nobligations owed to family members.  A Judge is not expected to address everything in the record,\nwhich would be a practical impossibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02243 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov.\n30, 2018).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence\n2\n\nin the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019).  Applicant contends\nthat the Judge held him to an impossibly high standard, in that he stated that Applicant\u2019s problems\nwould likely extend well into the future.  He argues that no one can be expected to remain debt-free. \nHowever, we construe the challenged statement to mean that, despite having held employment since\n2016, Applicant has not established a track record of debt payment.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015).  In fact, the Judge acknowledged explicitly that an applicant\nis not required to pay off all debts in order to receive a clearance.  The Judge did not employ the\nwrong standard in resolving Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation.  Compare, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 27, 2017) \u201c...[T]he Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s\n\u2018financial issues are recent and ongoing\u2019...\u201d\nApplicant cites a document the Board sends to the parties in all its cases.  The document\nmentions that the chairperson or designee may vary the terms of the document in certain\ncircumstances.  The document does not say that the provisions of the Directive will be varied. \nIndeed, the Chairperson has no such authority.\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 28, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant=s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive && E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge=s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge=s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant was 39 years old and was seeking a security clearance\nto work for a defense contractor.  He has earned three master\u2019s degrees.  He is single with no\nchildren.  He was either unemployed or not fully employed for over a year during 2015 and 2016. \nApplicant admitted to four incidents of criminal conduct between 1999 and 2014.  In 1999,\nhe was charged with felony second-degree burglary and misdemeanor stealing when he and a friend\ntook a vacuum cleaner from a house.  He was found guilty of both offenses and placed on probation\nfor five-year and two-year periods.  As result of a fight in 2000, he was charged with two felony\noffenses.  A first-degree assault charge alleged that he caused serious physical injury another.  This\noffense occurred when he was striking one individual with a pistol that fell to the ground discharging\na round into another individual.  He pled guilty to a reduced assault charge and armed criminal\naction, and he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for one charge and three years for the\nother.  He served about three years in prison.1 \nIn 2009, Applicant was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and reckless\noperation after a single-car accident.  He refused a roadside alcohol test.  Those charges were\ndisposed of through Applicant\u2019s completion of a pretrial intervention program.  In 2014, he was\ncharged with second-degree domestic assault, a felony.  This occurred when he had an argument and\nphysical altercation with his girlfriend in a restaurant after drinking shots of alcohol.  He pled guilty\nto a misdemeanor domestic assault charge and was sentenced to one year of confinement\n(suspended) and two years of probation under court supervision.  He was also required to complete\nan alcohol evaluation.  The court granted Applicant\u2019s request to terminate the probation shortly\nbefore he began his current employment.\n1 Since Applicant was sentenced to, and incarcerated for, more than one-year as a result of this conviction, he is\ndisqualified under the Bond Amendment from being granted or renewed access to Sensitive Compartmented\nInformation (SCI), Special Access Programs (SAP), or Restricted Data (RD).  See Directive, Encl. 2, App. B \u00b6 2. \n2\n\nApplicant also has a history of financial problems.  He admitted that he had 16 delinquent\naccounts totaling about $41,100.  With the assistance of a firm, he entered into a debt resolution\nagreement in which he agreed to make a monthly payments of about $300 for 11 delinquent accounts\nstarting in October 2017.  He stated he has made all payments under the agreement but did not\npresent supporting documentation.   He has not shown that any of the alleged accounts are resolved. \nHe described his financial situation as living paycheck to paycheck and owes about $200,000 in non-\nalleged student loans that are in deferment.  He expects the student loans to become due about three\nmonths after the hearing.  Through documents and four witnesses, he presented a wealth of favorable\ncharacter evidence. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his history of criminal conduct. \nAlthough he has taken the initial steps to address his financial problems, it is too early to tell if he\nwill adhere to his debt resolution agreement.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant does not dispute any of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  He contends that the Judge\ndid not consider all of the record evidence and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person concept.  For example, he asserts:\n[The Judge] fails to make mention that one of the root causes of the financial issues \nis the untimely and unanticipated health issues of [Applicant\u2019s] father that caused\nhim to leave his state of residence and travel to [another state] to care for his father. \nThis is a proper mitigating condition under the Guidelines that [the Judge] never\nmentions.  [Appeal Brief at 7.]\nThe Judge, however, made a finding of fact that Applicant attended to a family member with a\nserious illness during his period of unemployment.  See Decision at 3.  Applicant\u2019s arguments on\nappeal are neither sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence\nin the record nor enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018). \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s arguments are not sufficient to establish that the Judge erred in his whole-\nperson analysis. \nApplicant has failed to establish harmful error below.  The Judge examined the relevant\nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on\nthis record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent\nwith the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 9, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information), Guideline\nM (Use of Information Technology), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April\n12, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge\nMichael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether his right of cross-examination was\ndenied and whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\nwith the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis  \nApplicant is 57 years old, is a retired military member, and has worked in the industrial\nsecurity field for a number of years.  The SOR alleged that Applicant mishandled company\nproprietary information in 2015 when he transferred over 1,600 files to a company-approved external\nhard drive without authorization.  It also alleged that, during an investigation into that matter,\nApplicant was asked to return the hard drive, intentionally returned another hard drive, and then\nintentionally and without authorization destroyed the hard drive in question.  The Judge found\nagainst Applicant on both of those allegations.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on a third\nallegation that has not been raised as an issue on appeal.  \nApplicant provides varying accounts of the 2015 incident.  This incident came to light after\nApplicant and other employees had received layoff notices and were placed on elevated computer\nand email monitoring.  Additionally, a retroactive 90-day download report was generated that\nrevealed Applicant\u2019s multiple downloads to an external device.  When confronted by a company\nofficial about the downloads, Applicant denied downloading information to a personal hard drive. \nHe later destroyed the company-owed external hard drive.  \u201cThe investigation by Applicant\u2019s former\nemployer substantiated the allegations of damage to the company\u2019s assets and unauthorized\ndownloads.\u201d  Decision at 6.  Applicant resigned in lieu of termination from that former position.   \nApplicant did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising from\nhis intentional destruction of a company external hard drive to which he had transferred about 1,600\nfiles, including proprietary information, before beginning another job in the defense industry.  There\nare two main concerns: (1) Applicant gave varying accounts of the incident, and (2) he did not\nconduct himself as an honest person by not returning the external hard drive to his employer while\nhe still had it.  Applicant\u2019s transgressions were serious misconduct.  \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant cites to \u201cExecutive Order 10865[\u00a7 3](6) and DoDD 5220. 6,\nparagraph  4.3.3\" in arguing that his right of cross-examination was denied because he did not have\n2\n\nan opportunity to cross-examine the persons who produced Government Exhibit (GE) 2.  Appeal\nBrief at 2.  GE 2 consists of a document from Applicant\u2019s former employment record and a summary\nof an inquiry the former employer conducted into Applicant\u2019s downloading of files onto an external\ndevice.  In the decision, the Judge noted that the summary of the inquiry was prepared more than two\nyears after the incident in question and two days before the hearing was originally scheduled to be\nheld.  The Judge stated, \u201cit is obvious that the [summary] was prepared for the purpose of litigation\nin this case . . . .\u201d  Decision at 3.  The Judge also noted that the summary was not self-authenticating,\nwas not authenticated by a witness, and Applicant had no opportunity to cross-examine the person\nwho prepared it.  At the hearing, Applicant was represented by counsel.  During the hearing, the\nJudge asked Applicant\u2019s Counsel whether he had any objections to the admission of GE 2 into\nevidence.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel responded, \u201cNo objections . . . .\u201d  Tr. at 14.  In the decision, the\nJudge indicated that, although the summary was admitted without objection, he would weigh it in\nlight of the issues he highlighted.  In the past, the Appeal Board has held that an appealing party must\ntake timely, reasonable steps to raise objections or other procedural matters to preserve them for\nappeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-08813 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 15, 2005).  See also  ISCR Case No.\n03-00543 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 21, 2004)(discussing the purposes served in raising evidentiary or\nprocedural objections at the hearing).  Having failed to raise an appropriate objection below,\nApplicant cannot claim on appeal the Judge\u2019s consideration of GE 2 was error.  From review of the\nrecord, Applicant has not established that the right of cross-examination afforded him in the\nExecutive Order or Directive was denied because the Judge considered GE 2.     \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the downloaded files contained proprietary\ninformation.  In the findings of fact, the Judge stated \u201cApplicant had conducted multiple downloads\nto a \u2018possible personal external device,\u2019 since September 2015, with more than 1600 files being\nmoved, to include presumed personal files and company files that likely contained company\nproprietary information (e.g., security-related forms, presentation, templates, and letters).\u201d \n[Emphasis added.]  Decision at 6-7.  This finding is almost a verbatim quote (with some minor \nexceptions such as the deletion of the company\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s names) from a sentence in the\nsummary of the inquiry (GE 2).  In his analysis, however, the Judge stated Applicant \u201chad transferred\nor moved approximately 1,600 files, which included company proprietary information[.]\u201d [Emphasis\nadded.] Decision at 9.  In his brief, Applicant contends that it is speculation that the hard drive in\nquestion contained any company proprietary information.  Given the nature and quantity of the\ndownloaded files, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that proprietary information was included in those files was\na reasonable inference based on information in GE 2.  At most, the Judge\u2019s conclusion was a\nharmless error because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR 11-15184 at\n3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).   \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  He argues, for example, that his downloading of the files was done in the best\ninterests of the former employer and that he had no intent to harm the former employer.  These\narguments are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22,\n2017). \n3\n\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 12, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline G\n(Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On June 26, 2019, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nThe Judge found against Applicant on SOR allegations asserting that he received a Chapter\n7 bankruptcy discharge in 2017; that he failed to file his Federal income tax returns for 2013-2016\nas required; that he owed about $740 in state regional income taxes for 2013; and that he owes about\n$1,700 in Federal income taxes for 2013-2016.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on two other\nGuideline F allegations and all of the Guideline G allegations.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings are\nnot at issue on appeal.     \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant denied that he failed to file his Federal tax returns as\nrequired.  On appeal, he again makes that assertion, arguing he either filed on time or before six-\nmonth extensions expired.  In the decision, the Judge found that Applicant filed his 2013 Federal\nincome tax return on May 12, 2014 with no indication an extension was granted; that he filed his\n2014 return in November 2015, which was about a month after a filing extension due date; that he\nfiled his 2015 return on December 5, 2016, which was about two months after a filing extension due\ndate; and that he filed his 2016 return on May 29, 2017, with no indication an extension was granted. \nIn responding to interrogatories, Applicant submitted his IRS tax transcripts for each year in\nquestion.  From our review of the IRS tax transcripts, we are unsure exactly when Applicant filed\nhis tax returns.  For example, his 2013 Federal tax transcript contains the following information:\nRETURN DUE DATE OR RETURN RECEIVED DATE (WHICHEVER IS LATER)   Apr. 15, 2014\nPROCESSING DATE \n       May 12, 2014\nTRANSACTIONS \nCODE    EXPLANATION OF TRANSACTION\nCYCLE\nDATE\n           AMOUNT\n150\nTax return filed\n20141705\n05-12-2014       $5,798.00\nThe first two lines quoted above reflect that Applicant filed his tax return on or before April 15,\n2014, which would have been an on-time filing, and the IRS processed the return on May 12, 2014. \nOn the other hand, the bottom-quoted line apparently reflects that the return was filed on 5-12-2014,\nwhich would have about a month late absent the filing for an automatic extension.  The Judge did\nnot address this apparent conflict about the filing date in the decision.  Each of Applicant\u2019s tax\ntranscripts for the years in question contains a similar conflict.1  We note that the IRS Master File\n1 Viewing the tax transcripts in a light most favorable to Applicant, his 2014 and 2015 tax transcripts still reflect\nthat he filed those tax returns four days and two days after approved automatic extension due dates.  Such minor filing\ndeficiencies, however, do not raise security concerns.  \n2\n\nCodes2 indicate that Transaction Code 150 is for \u201cReturn Filed & Tax Liability Assessed,\u201d which\nappears to involve the processing of the return to assess the tax owed and might explain why an\namount is reflected on that transaction line and why the Transaction Code 150 date would also match\nthe processing date for a routine individual tax return.  This observation in not a finding of fact and\nis not binding on the Administrative Judge.   \nA Judge\u2019s task is to resolve apparent conflicts in the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n00281 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2014).  In light of Applicant\u2019s SOR response denying the alleged tax\nfiling deficiencies, we conclude the Judge erred in failing to address in his decision the contradiction\nin the IRS tax transcripts about the filing dates and then explain how he was resolving those\nconflicts.  Given that Applicant\u2019s remaining delinquent debts total about $2,500, we cannot conclude\na possible error in finding against Applicant on the tax filing deficiencies was harmless.3     \nAccordingly, we remand the case for the Judge to reopen the record to provide the parties an\nopportunity to present evidence and address the apparent conflict in the tax transcripts about tax\nreturn filing dates and to issue a new decision in accordance with the Directive. \n2 https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/6209-section-8a-2012.pdf\n3 In his appeal brief, Applicant also contends that he paid his Federal tax debt before the Judge issued the\ndecision, but there is no evidence in the record to support that claim.  \n3\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REMANDED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan        \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

On\nDecember 21, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  Subsequently, Department Counsel withdrew the\nGuideline E allegations.  On January 2, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nhis circumstances raised security concerns and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nThe Judge made the following findings that are pertinent to the issues raised on appeal:\nApplicant was chief executive officer and primary owner of a Subchapter S corporation, which\npasses income, losses, deductions and credits on to shareholders.  In 2011, he sold a division of this\ncompany, resulting in an adjusted gross income to him of nearly $6,000,000 and a tax liability of\nover $1,000,000.  Although Applicant made some payments toward his tax debt, including a\npayment of $200,000,  as of the close of the record he owed the IRS over $700,000 for tax year\n2011.  He also owed the IRS over $60,000 for 2012.  Applicant testified that he relied on the advice\nof an accountant to address the tax liability resulting from the sale of the division.  Rather than pay\nthe full amount of tax due, Applicant spent the proceeds from the sale on investing in the remainder\nof the company, paying off the mortgage on his home, paying off credit cards and loans, and setting\naside funds for his children\u2019s college.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s circumstances raised Guideline F disqualifying\nconditions, including the one found at Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 19(f): \u201cfailure to pay annual\nFederal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d  He found that Applicant had mitigated some of the\nSOR debts, though not those arising from his tax obligations.  He concluded that Applicant\u2019s tax\nliabilities are ongoing and continue to cast doubt on his trustworthiness and reliability.  He also\nstated that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible action in regard to his tax problems.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in holding that his tax debts raise security concerns. \nHowever, the Judge did not err in concluding that Applicant\u2019s ongoing tax debts raise concerns that\nhe may be lacking in qualities expected of those with access to classified information.  Indeed, the\nDirective presumes that there is a nexus between admitted or proved conduct under any of the\n2\n\nGuidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02595 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) .   Substantial tax obligations that have remained unresolved over several\nyears, despite an apparent ability to have addressed them, are sufficient to uphold the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion under Disqualifying Condition 19(f).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 17-01256\nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018) (A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations,\nsuch as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and\nreliability required of those granted access to classified information).\n  \nApplicant cites to record evidence that he argues is favorable to him, such as his reliance\nupon poor advice from his former accountant, his having hired a new one, and his efforts to address\nhis debts.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence\nin the record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019). \nMoreover, despite Applicant\u2019s argument to the contrary, the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complied\nwith the requirements of Directive \u00b6 6.3, in that he considered the totality of the evidence in reaching\nhis decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03592 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 14, 2017).\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.
