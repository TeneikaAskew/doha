Cervi, Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 13, \n2016. On June 14, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F.1 Applicant answered the SOR on September 25, 2018, and requested a \nhearing. \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) were revised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein. \n\n \n2 \n \nThe case was assigned to me on November 14, 2018. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on December 12, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for January 23, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified. The record was held open to permit Applicant to submit documentary \nevidence in mitigation, but no evidence was submitted. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on January 31, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old information technology support technician, employed by \na defense contractor since 2009. He graduated from high school in 1984. He married in \n2002 and has seven children, three of whom live with him. Applicant has never held a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on 17 debts totaling over $65,000; failed \nto pay Federal income taxes for tax years 1995-1997, 1999, and 2000-2012; owes the \nIRS for a tax lien totaling $13,930; and filed Chapter 13 bankruptcies in 1992, 2008, 2010, \n2011, and twice in 2012. All of the bankruptcy filings were dismissed except for 1992 that \nwas discharged in 1995, and 2012 that was discharged in 2017. The SOR allegations are \nsupported by substantial evidence. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with \nexplanations except he denied a debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m that he did not recognize. For some \ndebts he claimed to have included them in a credit repair agreement, and for others, he \nclaimed to have a payment plan. No documentary evidence of payment plans or credit \nrepair efforts was submitted. \n \nApplicant attributes his poor financial status largely to caring for his parents in their \nlatter years and helping with their financial needs. His father passed away in 2005 and \nhis mother passed away in 2012. Both suffered from illnesses and did not have the \nfinancial means to fully support themselves. Applicant\u2019s spouse has had an erratic \nemployment history due to medical conditions. Applicant also had a significant child-\nsupport obligation to satisfy. He used the Chapter 13 bankruptcy system to attempt to \ngain control of his finances, however three of the bankruptcies were dismissed due to \nApplicant\u2019s failure to make plan payments, or in one instance, failure to file required \ndocumentation. In his final bankruptcy discharged in 2017, he claimed $81,106 in \nunsecured debts, and paid $31,281 in disbursements to creditors.  \n \nApplicant testified that he could not pay his taxes when due, but he started a \nrepayment plan with the IRS in November 2018. At the time of the hearing, he testified \nthat he made two monthly payments toward the plan, and that $418 per month will be \nautomatically deducted from his checking account. He noted that he owes the IRS about \n$28,000. Applicant stated he has made three monthly installments toward a utility \ncompany debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j), and owes about $500. No documentary evidence has been \noffered to show that SOR debts have been addressed.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant spoke to a credit repair agency in 2018 and paid the initial fees, however \nhe has not shown that the company has made any progress with his debts. He admitted \nduring testimony that he is delinquent on payments on a credit card debt that he obtained \nto rebuild his credit because other financial needs arose. He also testified that he is behind \non student loan payments. These debts are not reflected on the SOR. He also admitted \nthat he has been irresponsible with debts and financially overextended over the years, \nand currently lives paycheck-to-paycheck. His spouse is not working and his children help \npay utility bills because they do not want to see him in a poor financial situation. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \n\n \n4 \n \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,  \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence are sufficient to establish \nthe disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial status was likely negatively impacted by his spouse\u2019s erratic \nemployment and health issues, his significant child support obligations, and his support \nfor his parents during their lives. However, he admitted to irresponsible financial practices \nand being financially overextended. Applicant has often availed himself of the bankruptcy \ncourt, and sought to discharge debts through the Chapter 13 process. Bankruptcy is a \nrecognized method of addressing debts and he successfully completed two bankruptcies, \nhowever he continued to incur debts and has long-standing unpaid obligations to the IRS \nfor delinquent taxes. Although he testified that his tax debts are being repaid in a payment \nplan, he has not shown documentary evidence of a plan or a reliable history of payments \nunder such a plan to determine that he is responsibly repaying the debt. Although his \nbankruptcies are largely mitigated, he has not shown that his other SOR debts have been \nadequately addressed. \n \nThe Appeal Board has long held: \n \nSecurity requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests \n\n \n6 \n \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \n \nApplicant\u2019s lack of financial responsibility with regard to tax obligations and other \ndebts, as well as a series of bankruptcy filings, show a history of financial difficulties that \nhave not been overcome to date. He has incurred additional debt despite his 2017 \nChapter 13 discharge, and has only begun to make payments on his substantial tax \nobligations. Applicant has retained a credit repair agency and presumably completed \ncourt-ordered financial counseling, but he has not shown an improved financial status. \nOverall, based on the record presented, I am unable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are under control or are unlikely to recur. No conditions fully apply to mitigate \nhis delinquent tax obligations and other debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).2 Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s personal \ndifficulties do not overcome his history of financial irresponsibility. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n2 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to \ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age \nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence \nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \n \n  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g \u2013 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 7, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 11, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer.) A subsequent email from Applicant requested that the \nhearing be converted to a decision on the written record in lieu of the hearing. Department \nCounsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on August 28, \n2019. Applicant did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence and identified as Items 1 \nthrough 6. Applicant received the form on September 11, 2019.  The case was assigned \nto me on November 19, 2019. Applicant responded to the FORM and presented \ndocuments. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 51, is divorced and has two children. She obtained her \nundergraduate degree in 2011 and her master\u2019s in 2013. Applicant completed her security \nclearance application on August 10, 2017. She has never held a security clearance. (Item \n3) Applicant has been employed with her current employer since 2003, as an electrical \nengineer. \n  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has delinquent debt in the approximate amount of \n$63,756. (Items 5, 6) The debts include a charged-off home equity loan, various medical \nbills, and a charged-off credit card. (Item 1) Applicant admitted the allegations with the \nexception of four minor debts (1.c-1.f), which she avers that she paid in February 2018. \n(Item 2) She provided explanations for each allegation. \n \nApplicant acknowledged her debt, but she denied that she is not doing anything \nabout it. She stated that most of the debt that is concerning medical issues is due to many \nsurgeries and high insurance deductibles. She is taking care of her current partner \nfinancially while he awaits his social security disability hearing.  He does not work. She \ndoes not agree that looking at her credit card reports make her a person who has poor \nself-control and is financially unstable. (Item 2) \n \nApplicant stated that as to SOR allegation 1.a, the home equity loan for about \n$43,026, is the result of a loan that she and her ex-husband opened in 2005, and he was \nnot paying child support. She disclosed on her SCA that she became behind in payments \nand is now working with a company to establish a repayment plan. She has been paying \n$179.98 monthly since March 2018. She submitted recent receipts and a statement to \nshow that the balance is $40,316. (Response to FORM, Item 4) \n \nAs to SOR 1.b, a charged-off account in the amount of $14,068, Applicant \nacknowledged the debt and stated that she is working with them currently to establish \nrepayment terms. She provided information that she hired a lawyer and signed an \nagreement for garnishment of $200 per pay period. The garnishment started in \nSeptember 2018, and the remaining balance is $13,286. \n \nAs to the medical accounts listed in SOR 1.c-1.f, Applicant denied the accounts \nbecause she stated that she paid them in February 2018. There is not documentation to \nconfirm her assertion.  \n \n The remaining medical accounts listed in the SOR 1.g -1.k have not been paid. In \nApplicant\u2019s 2017-2018 investigative interview, she takes responsibility for some of them \nand she disputes some of the accounts. There is no indication that she has addressed \nthe accounts, although she stated in her interview that she would look in to them and has \nbeen \u201cpaying them down.\u201d (Item 4) Her intent is to pay all her accounts that are delinquent. \nHer goal is to pay all delinquent accounts in two to three years. (Item 4) \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant stated that she took money from her 401(k) retirement account to help \nher former husband, and that left her in a troublesome financial situation. She believes \nhe is in jail at this time. In Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, she mentioned that she is \ndisputing certain accounts on her credit report through the various reporting agencies. \nHowever, she did not specify which accounts or provide any documentation reflecting a \ndispute. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant has not had any financial counseling. There is no information in the \nrecord concerning a salary or budget. She did not report any unemployment. (Item, 3) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n4 \n \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \n\n \n5 \n \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are long-standing, and she acknowledged that she \nhas not resolved them. She recently started a repayment plan for the home equity loan. \nShe has been on notice that her financial situation is of concern to the Government for \nalmost two years. She also learned of the accounts in her 2017 OPM interview. It is not \nclear from the record, except for the medical accounts, what events were beyond her \ncontrol and the specific nexus for the unresolved accounts. Applicant stated that she paid \na few of them, but provided no documentation. Thus, from the record, it cannot be \ndetermined if she applied any good-faith efforts until last year. She also recently entered \ninto a garnishment agreement in late 2018 with the creditor in SOR 1.b. In her response \nto FORM, she stated that she has disputed some accounts, but did not specify which \naccounts. Without documentary evidence of more efforts, she has not demonstrated a \ntrack record of financial responsibility, and there is no indication that her financial situation \nis under control. She has not received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved, but she promises to address them. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. While Applicant\u2019s surgeries were beyond her control, \nshe has not acted responsibly to address the resulting debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not receive any financial \ncounseling; nor are there clear indications that her financial situation is under control.  Her \ncurrent ability to pay her delinquent debts is in doubt as she stated that she lives on  some \nsavings. Her financial problems are not under control.  \n \nApplicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.k. against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n6 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s work career and medical issues, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her financial indebtedness. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b:-1.k: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Additionally, he did not comply with the terms of his probation by consuming \nalcohol and failing to complete court-ordered alcohol counseling. He did not present \nsufficient information to mitigate the security concerns about his alcohol consumption. His \nrequest for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 22, 2018, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators, having been \nunable to determine from available information that it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security for Applicant to have a security clearance,1 issued a \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n04/08/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under the \nadjudicative guideline for alcohol consumption (Guideline G).2 Applicant timely responded \nto the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without a hearing; however, on August \n17, 2018, Department Counsel requested a hearing, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 \nof the Directive. \n \n \nI received the case on September 19, 2018, and convened the requested hearing \non December 11, 2018. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel \nproffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 10, all of which were admitted into evidence.3 \nApplicant testified on his own behalf. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January \n2, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline G, the Government alleged that in August 2012, Applicant was \ncharged with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol (SOR 1.a); that in June 2016 he \nagain was charged with DUI, and that because he failed to comply with the terms of his \nsentence, warrants for his arrest were issued in July 2016 and May 2017 (SOR 1.b); and \nthat in July 2017, he was arrested for DUI (SOR 1.c). In response, Applicant admitted, \nwith explanations, each of the allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established \nby Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old. Since June 2015, he has worked in an information \ntechnology position for a large defense contractor. Between September 2007 and June \n2015, he held similar positions with several other companies in both the defense industry \nand the private sector. Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force from October 1999 until \nbeing honorably discharged in September 2007. Applicant was married from March 2009 \nuntil divorcing his wife in June 2013. They have two children, ages 9 and 13, together. \nApplicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and is working toward a master\u2019s \ndegree in the same field. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 6) \n \n \nApplicant first consumed alcohol at age 19 while stationed overseas with the Air \nForce. At that time, he would drink socially at least once a week, consuming two or three \nmixed drinks each time. After returning to the United States in early 2002, he did not \nconsume alcohol again until he turned 21 in 2003. His drinking then moderated, occurring \nonly about once or twice monthly. Applicant\u2019s drink of choice was a mixed drink of whiskey \nand a soft drink. He claims he has not consumed any alcohol since May 2017. He has \ndescribed himself as a \u201cproblem drinker\u201d in response to a questionnaire he completed \nduring alcohol counseling in 2013. (GX 2; Tr. 34 \u2013 36, 47 \u2013 48, 59) \n \n                                                 \n2 The adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, \nand made effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n3 GX 7 and GX 10 were admitted over Applicant\u2019s objections. (Tr. 24 \u2013 26, 28 \u2013 29) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first arrest for DUI occurred on August 17, 2012. He had been out at a \nclub where he consumed at least five shots of alcohol. On the way home, his car hit a \ncurb and one of his tires went flat. As he was trying to change the tire, police arrived and \ndetermined that he was intoxicated. Applicant testified he believed a blood test taken \nwhen he was arrested revealed he had a .87 blood alcohol content (BAC). Applicant later \npleaded guilty to DUI and was sentenced to two years of probation, with leave to petition \nfor early release from probation after one year if in compliance with the terms of his \nprobation, which began on June 18, 2013. Those terms included completion of 52 hours \nof alcohol counseling and 48 hours of community service within 10 months of sentencing. \nApplicant also was ordered to abstain from alcohol during probation. Applicant completed \nhis probation in June 2015. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 4; Tr. 36 \u2013 40) \n \n \n \nOn June 25, 2016, Applicant was again arrested and charged with DUI. Applicant \nclaimed he had been at a friend\u2019s house that evening and had two beers, which he \nnormally would not drink and resulted in an upset stomach. He stated that as he drove \nhome, he had no cell service and became lost as he was unfamiliar with the area where \nhis friend lived. He decided to pull off the road and sleep in his vehicle until it became \nlight out and he could get his bearings. Police later arrived and woke him up. Applicant \naverred that they smelled alcohol on his breath only because he had vomited earlier in \nthe evening. He also denied being intoxicated when police arrived, and he claimed the \npolice told him he had passed the field sobriety test they administered before arresting \nhim. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 40 \u2013 43) \n \n \nAccording to a police report about his arrest, police found Applicant asleep in his \nvehicle in the middle of a private one-lane road. They had difficulty waking him up and \nthere was vomit on the driver\u2019s side door. Applicant appeared disoriented and could not \nprovide cogent answers to their questions about his understanding of where he was or \nhow he wound up there. After Applicant refused a roadside sobriety test, he was placed \nunder arrest and transported to a police station where he was given a breathalyzer test. \nThe results of that test showed that, more than an hour after police took him into custody, \nhe had a BAC of .158. The record does not reflect what time he last consumed alcohol. \nAfter initially pleading not guilty to DUI, Applicant pleaded guilty. On January 5, 2017, \nApplicant was sentenced to 10 days in jail (with credit for one day already served when \nhe was first arrested) to be served by February 17, 2017. He also was placed on \nsupervised probation for two years, was assessed $2,200 in fines and court costs, \nordered to complete a drug and alcohol evaluation, and complete any alcohol counseling \nas directed in his drug and alcohol evaluation, and complete 48 hours of community \nservice. Applicant was also ordered to abstain from alcohol during his term of probation.  \n(GX 4; GX 9) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s probation requirements also included regular urinalysis testing. In May \n2017, Applicant tested positive for alcohol. He claims that he advised his probation officer \nthe day after he consumed champagne while celebrating a recreational sports victory with \nhis friends. Further, on July 26, 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. \nApplicant has denied consuming any alcohol that evening, and that he was acting as the \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \ndesignated driver for two intoxicated friends who were in the car with him when he was \nstopped for speeding. They and the driver of a second car traveling with Applicant\u2019s were \nout celebrating a birthday. According to the police reports of his arrest, Applicant failed a \nfield sobriety test and was taken into custody. After refusing a breathalyzer at the scene, \nhe was transported to a nearby hospital and blood was drawn over an hour after he was \narrested. That blood sample showed Applicant had a .091 BAC, which exceeded the legal \nlimit for alcohol. (Answer; GX 2; GX 7; Tr. 43) \n \n \nApplicant was charged with DUI; however, on December 15, 2017, the charge was \ndismissed. On the night of Applicant\u2019s arrest, police also stopped the other car driven by \nanother friend with whom they had been out celebrating. That person also was suspected \nof DUI but had a lower BAC. A prosecutor mistakenly based his decision to enter \nApplicant\u2019s charge as nolle prosequi on the other driver\u2019s information. Nonetheless, in \nJuly 2017, Applicant\u2019s probation was revoked because he had consumed alcohol in May \n2017, and because he had not yet completed the terms of his sentence for the June 2016 \nDUI conviction. Specifically, Applicant had not completed his jail sentence, and he had \nnot completed his alcohol counseling. Applicant was ordered to jail on July 7, 2017. After \nhis release from jail, Applicant was returned to probation; however, in September 2017, \nanother probation revocation hearing was held because he had not yet completed \nrequired counseling and pending the outcome of his July 2017 charges, which occurred \nin a different jurisdiction. Applicant was returned to probation on March 8, 2018. At his \nhearing in this matter, Applicant disclosed that he has yet to complete court-ordered \nalcohol counseling and will remain on probation until he does so. (Answer; GX 2; GX 7; \nGX 10; Tr. 44 \u2013 52, 56) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of \nthe guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n                                                 \n4 See Directive. 6.3. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.6 A person who has access \nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based \non trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the Government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAvailable information shows that Applicant has been arrested three times for DUI \nand that he has, at times, consumed alcohol to excess. He has described himself as a \n\u201cproblem drinker\u201d and he is still on probation for his 2016 DUI conviction because he has \nnot yet completed court-ordered alcohol counseling. This information reasonably raises \na security concern about alcohol consumption that is expressed at AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nThe facts and circumstances of this case require application of the following AG \u00b6 \n22 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \n                                                 \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n7 See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \n \n \nI also have considered the following mitigating conditions available to Applicant \nunder AG \u00b6 23: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nApplicant claims he has not consumed alcohol since May 2017, when he tested \npositive for alcohol through a urinalysis test administered by his probation officer; \nhowever, a blood test two months later showed he had consumed more than the legal \nlimit before he was pulled over in July 2017 and charged with DUI. The dismissal of that \ncharge does not negate the security significance of available information about his use of \nalcohol on that occasion. Additionally, the significance of Applicant\u2019s current abstinence \nis attenuated by the likelihood he will be jailed should he be found to have consumed \nalcohol because he is still on probation for his 2016 DUI conviction. Indeed, his only \nsignificant periods of sobriety in the last six years have occurred while he has been under \ncourt orders to abstain from alcohol. Additionally, despite Applicant\u2019s first DUI conviction \nin 2013, Applicant repeated his conduct twice over the next four years. All of the foregoing \nundermines any confidence that Applicant will not again engage in alcohol-related \nmisconduct or that his use of alcohol is no longer of concern. Applicant did not meet his \nburden of persuasion in response to the Government\u2019s information. None of the AG \u00b6 22 \nmitigating conditions apply and the security concerns about his use of alcohol have not \nbeen resolved. \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). I note that Applicant served honorably in the United States Air Force and \nthat he has been gainfully employed in the information technology industry since leaving \nthe military. Nonetheless, this information, without a showing that Applicant\u2019s use of \nalcohol no longer is a security concern, is not sufficient to resolve the doubts raised by \nthe Government\u2019s information. Because protection of the interests of national security is \nthe principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved against \nthe granting of access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s \nevidence in mitigation was insufficient to mitigate security concerns raised by his family \ncircumstances. Based upon the record evidence as a whole, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 21, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in \nconnection with his employment. On July 2, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline B. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, \n1960); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \n\n2 \n \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 31, 2018. He requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn July 17, 2019, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nSeptember 6, 2019, scheduling the hearing on September 26, 2019.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered three \ndocuments, which I marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 - 3. She also requested that \nI marked the Department Counsel\u2019s Exhibit List as Hearing Exhibit 1. Applicant raised no \nobjection to the Government\u2019s proposed exhibits and offered no exhibits of his own at the \nhearing. I left the record open until October 3, 2019, to allow Applicant the opportunity to \nmake a post-hearing submission and to make any corrections to GE 2, which is the report \nof investigation summarizing Applicant\u2019s August 19, 2017 background interview. On \nOctober 1, 2019, he sent a document to me by e-mail, which I marked as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AE) A. In his e-mail, he noted that he had no corrections to GE 2. On October 2, \n2019, Department Counsel advised me in an e-mail that she had no objection to AE A. \nAll exhibits were admitted into the record. I have marked the two referenced emails as \nHearing Exhibits 2 and 3. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 15, 2019. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about the Republic of Iraq (Iraq). I have marked this request as Hearing \nExhibit 4. Applicant did not object to this request, and I have taken administrative notice \nof the facts contained in the request that are supported by source documents that are \nofficial U.S. Government publications. The facts are summarized in the Findings of Fact, \nbelow. Department Counsel made no request that I take administrative notice of facts \nregarding Egypt. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted, with explanations, the five allegations in the SOR. I have \nincorporated his admissions in my findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is \nextracted from GE 1, his SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to \nthe record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, the hearing testimony, \nand the documentary evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iraq in 1973 and is presently 46 years old. He and his wife \nwere married in Iraq in 1997. They and two of their three children entered the United \nStates in 2009. Applicant entered the United States as a refugee at the age of 35. In 2011, \nhe and his wife had a third child, who was born in the United States. Applicant became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2014. His wife and two oldest children have also become \nnaturalized U.S. citizens. (Tr. 14-15; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 32.) \n \n\n3 \n \n \nIn 1996, Applicant received an engineering degree in Iraq. For a little less than two \nyears ending in 2005, Applicant\u2019s Iraqi engineering company worked with the U.S. Army \nunder a contract. Through his company, he performed services on several infrastructure \nprojects, such as potable water, sewer systems, storm drains and road paving. In 2005, \nhe received two anonymous threats by phone from a terrorist organization telling him to \nstop working for the United States. He then received an even more threatening warning \nand decided that his life was at risk. After living in Iraq for the first 30 years of his life, he \ntook his family to Egypt, where they lived until 2009. During that period, he returned to \nIraq on several occasions. He was unable to work in Egypt because he was not an \nEgyptian citizen. He learned about an organization that assists refugees to relocate to the \nUnited States. In 2009, he successfully sought refuge in this country. (Tr. 7, 30; GE 2 at \n2; AE A.) \n \n \nOnce in the United States, Applicant purchased a gas station and operated it for \nabout three years. He purchased a home in 2014 after he sold the gas station. He \nsubsequently bought a less expensive home where he and his family presently reside. \n(Tr. 16-17.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and two siblings also immigrated to the United States with him \nin 2009 and became U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s father worked in the Iraqi Ministry of Trade \nas an accounting manager before he immigrated to the United States. Applicant\u2019s mother \nis and always has been a housewife. Left behind in Iraq is one brother and his wife (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a), his wife\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.b), sister (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and brother (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law died in 2000. He was a lawyer in the Iraqi Ministry of Finance. \n(Tr. 29; GE 3 at 26, 31, 33, 37.)  \n \n \nApplicant has weekly contact by phone with his brother, who lives in Baghdad. In \nhis SCA, Applicant reported that his brother rents cars for an Iraqi company. At the \nhearing, Applicant testified that this brother is a civil engineer like himself. Applicant\u2019s \ncontact with his brother\u2019s wife, who is a housewife, is limited to monthly calls. Applicant\u2019s \nmother-in-law is a retired elementary school teacher, who worked for the Iraqi Ministry of \nEducation. He has weekly contact with her by phone. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law works for \na foreign airline in Iraq. In his SCA, Applicant also reported that he has weekly contact \nwith her by phone. He testified at the hearing that he only speaks with her every two or \nthree months. Applicant\u2019s wife has a very close relationship with this sister. The brother \nof Applicant\u2019s wife works as a lawyer in the Law Department of the Iraqi Media Network, \na government agency. According to his SCA, Applicant has weekly contact with him, \nthough Applicant\u2019s wife speaks with her brother more often. At the hearing, Applicant \ntestified that he only speaks with his brother-in-law every two or three months. Applicant \nalso visits each of these relatives when he travels to Iraq, which he has done in 2006 (two \ntimes), 2007 (one time), 2008 (four times), 2009 (one time), 2015 (one time), and 2016 \n(one time). He did not travel to Iraq between 2009 and 2015 because of the requirements \nto obtain U.S. citizenship. He travels on his Iraqi passport because he believes it is \ndangerous to be identified as a U.S. citizen. He renewed his Iraqi passport when he was \nin Iraq in 2016. (Tr. 19-20, 22-26; GE 2 at 4, 6-8; GE 3 at 16-23, 26, 31, 33, 37.) \n \n\n4 \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant has a friend who is citizen and resident of \nEgypt (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant met this foreign national while he was living in Egypt from \n2005 to 2009. The friend is a \u201crespectable businessman.\u201d Applicant has traveled to Egypt \nin 2014 (one time), 2015 (seven times), 2016 (two times), and 2017 (one time). In addition, \nhe has traveled to the United Arab Emirates on five occasions during the 2015-2017 \nperiod. He notes in his SCA that all of his travel to Egypt and Iraq was to \u201cvisit family or \nfriends,\u201d and his repeated travel to the United Arab Emirates was for \u201ctourism.\u201d (SOR \nresponse at 1.) \nApplicant owns his home, but he has exhausted his savings and has limited funds \nand no retirement accounts. He has been unemployed since 2017. He has been offered \nemployment in Iraq as a linguist. He seeks a security clearance in connection with that \nemployment offer. (Tr. 8-9, 12, 18; GE 3 at 5.)  \nIRAQ \nThe U.S. Department of State warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq remain at high risk \nfor kidnapping and terrorist violence and advises them to avoid all travel to Iraq. The ability \nof the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside of Baghdad is \nextremely limited given the security environment. ISIS controls or is present, directly or \nthrough affiliates, in portions of Iraq\u2019s territory. Within areas under ISIS control, the Iraqi \ngovernment has little or no ability to control and ensure public safety.  \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such \ngroups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay also threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. U.S. \nGovernment and western interests remain possible targets for attacks. The U.S. \nGovernment considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. Government \npersonnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under strict \nsecurity guidelines.  \nThere are significant human rights problems in Iraq to include: sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, and the lack of transparency at all levels of the Iraqi government \nand society, which has weakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective \nhuman rights protections. Iraqi security forces and members of the Federal Police have \ncommitted human rights violations to include killing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. \nThere are also problems that include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention \nand prison facilities, arbitrary arrest, lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, \nlimits on freedom of expression, freedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on \npeaceful assembly, and societal abuses of women. ISIS is also responsible for human \nrights abuses. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \n\n5 \n \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n\n6 \n \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s relatives in Iraq, his admissions in his SOR response and at the \nhearing and the documentary evidence in the record establish the following potentially \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nnecessary to raise these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened \nrisk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living \nunder a foreign government. The totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as \nwell as each individual family tie must be considered.  \n \n\n7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother, his brother\u2019s wife, his mother-in-law, and his brother and sister-\nin-law are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant and his wife have ties of affection to \neach of them. He maintains regular contact with these relatives, as does his wife with her \nimmediate family and the spouses of her siblings. Applicant\u2019s family residing in Iraq \ncreates a heightened risk and a potential foreign influence concern. \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq because \nof continued instability and threats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. It also \nhas serious concerns about terrorist activities in Iraq that specifically target Americans. \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Iraq because of terrorists and \ninsurgents. A number of years ago, Applicant supported the U.S. Army through his work \nas an engineer, but had to flee the country out of fear for his safety. Now he is willing to \nreturn to Iraq and work for the U.S. Army again, this time as a linguist. Thousands of the \nU.S. and coalition armed forces and civilian contractors serving in Iraq are targets of \nterrorists, along with Iraqi civilians, who support the Iraq Government and cooperate with \ncoalition forces.  \n \nThe mere possession of a close personal relationship with a person, who is a \ncitizen and resident of a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under \nGuideline B. However, depending on the facts and circumstances, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment; the government ignores the rule of law including widely accepted civil \nliberties; a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government; the \ngovernment is engaged in a counterinsurgency actions; terrorists cause a substantial \namount of death or property damage; or the country is known to conduct intelligence \ncollection operations against the United States. The relationship of Iraq with the United \nStates, and the situation in Iraq place a significant, but not insurmountable burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships with his family members \nliving in Iraq do not pose a security risk. Applicant, however, should not be placed a \nposition where he might be forced to choose between his loyalty to the United States and \na desire to assist a relative living in Iraq.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives or terrorists from Iraq seek \nor have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his family, \nnevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the future. International \nterrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as effectively as capable state \nintelligence services, and Iraq has an enormous problem with terrorism. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships with relatives living in Iraq create a potential conflict of interest because \nterrorists could place pressure on his family living there in an effort to cause Applicant to \ncompromise classified information. These relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of \n\n8 \n \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Substantial \nevidence was produced of Applicant\u2019s contacts with family in Iraq and has raised the issue \nof potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply \nto SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d.  \n \nThe Government did not pursue an argument for disqualification under SOR \u00b6 1.e \nregarding Applicant\u2019s Egyptian friend. In the absence of evidence of a heightened risk or \na conflict of interest with respect to this friend, neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) nor 7(b) has been \nestablished.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant has not established mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a). The nature of his \nrelationships with Iraqi relatives, as alleged in the SOR, and the country in which they \nreside, preclude a conclusion that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position \nof having to choose between the interests of his Iraqi relatives and the interests of the \nUnited States.  \n \n \nSimilarly, mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b) has not been established. The record \nevidence demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty and obligation to his Iraqi \nrelatives, including his wife\u2019s relatives, is quite strong. He has frequently traveled to Iraq \nto visit them, despite the fact that he feared for his life and fled Iraq, first to Egypt, and \nthen to the United States as a refugee. Also, he frequently communicates with these \nrelatives by telephone. His loyalty and sense of obligation to these persons is hardly \n\u201cminimal.\u201d In fairness, Applicant also has a significant relationship with the United States. \nHis parents, several siblings, wife, and children are citizens and residents of the United \nStates. In 2003 to 2005, he also served the U.S Army admirably and with significant risk \nthrough his Iraqi engineering company. Applicant has only resided in the United States \n\n9 \n \nsince 2009, however, and has only been a U.S. citizen since 2014. His U.S. assets are \nbasically limited to the equity he has in his residence. During the past ten years, he has \nfrequently travelled abroad to visit family and friends. It cannot be concluded that \nApplicant\u2019s relationships and loyalties in the United States are so deep and longstanding \nthat he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established with respect to the Iraqi relatives alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s contacts and communications with these relatives is not casual or infrequent \nso as to create little likelihood that those relationships could create a risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAs a refugee, Applicant has a unique connection to the United States compared to \nmost U.S. citizens. He has also served the U.S. Army in helping to rebuild Iraq. \nNevertheless, the presence in Iraq of his brother with whom he is close, and his wife\u2019s \nrelatives, with whom she is close and to whom he is obligated as his wife\u2019s family \nmembers, creates a potentially difficult conflict of interest and a heightened risk of \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his multiple contacts and connections \nwith Iraqi citizens and residents. \n \n \n \n\n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

He has numerous on-going contacts with citizens and/or residents of \nAfghanistan and/or Pakistan. Additionally, his extramarital affair with a foreign national \ncreated an unmitigated heightened risk for exploitation. He successfully mitigated the \nGuideline E, personal conduct security concern. National security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 22, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines B, foreign influence, and E, personal conduct. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), implemented June 8, 2017.  \n03/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on September 18, 2018, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted its file of relevant material (FORM) on January 28, 2019. Applicant received it \non February 10, 2019. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 11. \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant submitted a one-page email in response to the FORM (Response) within the \ntime period. Items 1 through 7 are admitted into the record. The case was assigned to me \non March 4, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nIn the FORM, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Department Counsel provided summaries of \nthe facts, supported by Government documents pertaining to Afghanistan and Pakistan, \nmarked as Items 8 through 11. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the \nU.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject \nto reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nPursuant to Additional Procedural Guidance \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.2, E3.1.3, E3.1.7, and \nE3.1.13 of the Directive, Department Counsel moved in the FORM to amend the SOR \nissued to Applicant to conform to the evidence. Applicant raised no objections to the \namendment in his Response, and I grant the motion. The SOR \u00b6 1.j is amended to: \n \n1.j. You have provided approximately $1,000 in financial support to your \nfather-in-law. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g and 1.j. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, \nand 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old linguist for a government contractor, with whom he has \nbeen employed since October 2017. He previously worked as a linguist in Afghanistan \nfor another government contractor from 2011 to 2014. He was injured while in Afghanistan \nand recuperated in the United States from January 2012 to April 2012. He returned to \nAfghanistan until 2014. It is unknown whether his injury related to his job as a linguist. \n(Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \n \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan. He attended high school in Pakistan. He \nimmigrated to the United States in 2008. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2017. He \nresides in a home owned by his father in the United States. His mother, father, and \nbrothers are citizens and residents of the United States. His sister is a permanent resident \nin the United Sates and a citizen of Afghanistan. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn 2014, Applicant married his wife in Pakistan. Together, they have one child born \nin 2017. His wife is a 24-year-old citizen of Afghanistan and resides with Applicant in the \nUnited States. She is a homemaker. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a 38-year-old citizen and \nresident in Afghanistan. She is a homemaker. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a 49-year-old \ncitizen and resident in Afghanistan. He is self-employed in an import-export business. \nApplicant disclosed on his security clearance application that he sent his father-in-law \n$500 twice. Applicant later corrected this statement to clarify that he sent his father-in-law \ntwo payments totaling $500 to assist with Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s move to the United States. \nApplicant has not spoken to his in-laws since his wedding. The record does not indicate \nthe frequency at which Applicant\u2019s wife contacts her parents or if she visits them in \nAfghanistan. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother is a citizen of Afghanistan and resident in Pakistan. \nApplicant last had in-person contact with her in 2014. Applicant maintains monthly \ntelephonic contact with his grandmother. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant has two cousins who are citizens of Afghanistan, but reside in Pakistan. \nNeither cousin has served in the military. They are both self-employed. The SOR alleged \nthat Applicant sent approximately $12,000 in support to one of his cousins. That allegation \nwas based upon Applicant\u2019s disclosure on his security clearance application that he \nprovided his cousin $2,000 on six occasions. Applicant denied that amount in his Answer. \nHe recalculated the funds sent to his cousin by adding up receipts for the transactions \nand found that he sent a total of $3,105 over four to five years. (Answer; Item 3; Item 4; \nItem 5; Item 6.) He indicated: \n \nThe reason of sending this amount is because of my spouse expenses and \nmy own cloths, dry fruit and because of Muslim Eid occasion where we sent \nmoney to do Sacrifices of a Goat, cow [sic] from behalf of me and my family. \n(Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant maintained contact with two childhood friends. One is a citizen of \nAfghanistan who resides in Pakistan. This friend is a student and supports himself by \nperforming odd jobs. Applicant speaks to him once or twice a year by phone. The other \nis a citizen and resident of Pakistan. He runs a gas station. Neither friend has \u201cmilitary \nexperience.\u201d Applicant last saw the second friend in 2014 at Applicant\u2019s wedding, and has \none or two telephone conversations with him yearly. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant had an extramarital relationship with an Afghan citizen residing in the \nUnited Kingdom from approximately October 30, 2017 to January 2018. They met on a \nsocial media platform. The relationship ended after the woman became engaged to marry \nanother man. She was a student and worked part-time in an electronics store. Applicant \nhas not had contact with her since January 2018. Applicant told \u201chis wife he was traveling \nto England to visit a friend, and that is all she is required to know . . . in his culture he is \nnot required to tell his wife any further information.\u201d He did not plan to tell his wife about \nhis extramarital relationship. Applicant did not feel the information could be used to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nblackmail him because he knows his wife \u201cwould never believe he would ever be \nunfaithful.\u201d (Answer.) \n \nApplicant failed to list the woman with whom he had the extramarital affair with on \nhis November 17, 2017 security clearance application under foreign contacts. However, \nhe denied that the omission was intentional. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) He explained: \n \nI have mention[ed] [name omitted] during my CI interview with full detail and \nthe reason [I] first missed it to put it in (e-QIP) Maybe because [I] didn\u2019t \ndouble check my all detail and was unable to put everything\u2019s which [I] \nshould have, it [was] also possible because when there is too much paper \nwork there is always a chance a person missed some of the information to \nput because naturally a person want to finish things in a hurry. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant provided a copy of his itinerary showing that he flew to London in October \n2, 2017, and returned early November 2017. His child was born the day after his return \nto the United States. He disclosed this travel on his security clearance application and \nlisted the purpose of his trip as \u201ctourism.\u201d He disclosed his extramarital affair with the \nresident of the United Kingdom at his November 20, 2017 counterintelligence screening. \n(Item 6.) The next day, November 21, 2017, he signed his security clearance application. \n(Item 4.) Despite disclosing the extramarital relationship to the Government, his wife does \nnot know of the affair. \n \nAfghanistan \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has issued a travel warning for Afghanistan, due to \ncrime, terrorism, civil unrest, and armed conflict. It notes that travel to all areas of \nAfghanistan is unsafe due to the ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage taking, military \ncombat operations, suicide bombings, and insurgent attacks. Attacks may target official \nAfghan and U.S. governmental convoys and compounds. Extremists associated with \nTaliban networks and the Islamic State are active throughout Afghanistan. Widespread \nhuman rights abuses are reported. (Item 9.) \n \nPakistan \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has issued a travel warning for Pakistan due to \nterrorist threats. Terrorists in Pakistan attack with little or no warning and target public \nplaces like shopping malls, airports, universities, military installations, and tourist \nlocations. Further, human rights abuses including extrajudicial and targeted killings, \ndisappearances, torture, lack of rule of law, and vigilante justice exist in Pakistan. (Item \n10.) \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology;  \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling or residing outside the U.S., that may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \n \n  \nApplicant has close connections to his wife, who is a citizen of Afghanistan, \nresiding with Applicant in the United States. Her parents are citizens of and residents in \nAfghanistan. Applicant\u2019s grandmother, with whom he has monthly contact, is a citizen of \nAfghanistan residing in Pakistan. His cousins and friends are residents of Pakistan. \nFurther, there is an articulated heightened risk associated with having ties to family \nmembers and friends in Afghanistan and Pakistan, due to the activities of terrorist \norganizations and human rights abuses within their borders. There is also a heightened \nrisk associated with having an extramarital affair with a foreign national. His extramarital \nrelationship with an Afghan citizen residing in the United Kingdom may make him \nvulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, \nor country. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to present sufficient evidence to establish any \nof the above mitigating conditions. Applicant is in contact with his family and friends in \nboth Afghanistan and Pakistan. He provided some financial support to his family in \nPakistan. Due to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his family, and the terrorist threats and \nhuman rights abuses in Afghanistan and Pakistan, I cannot find it is unlikely he would be \nplaced in a position of choosing between them and the interests of the United States. \nFurther, his wife is not aware of his extramarital affair. He could be subject to coercion as \na result. He failed to demonstrate deep and longstanding loyalties to the United States \nthat would demonstrate he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. While he is credited for his years of service to the United States as a linguist, the \nrecord contains little information on assets, or physical or emotional bonds to the United \nStates, aside from the presence of his immediate family, parents and siblings in the United \nStates. Without more information, it cannot be determined that Applicant would resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information or sensitive information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant failed to identify a foreign contact when he omitted his girlfriend on his \nNovember 2017 security clearance application, even though he had visited her in England \njust 19 days prior to completing the form. However, that omission was not intentional, as \nhe had reported his extramarital relationship to the Government during his \ncounterintelligence screening the day prior to submitting his security clearance \napplication. He also reported his travel to the United Kingdom. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \napplicable.1  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n                                                          \n1 The SOR did not allege Applicant\u2019s extramarital affair was disqualifying because it was conduct that \ncreated a vulnerability to exploitation under Guideline E. As a result, it is not proper to consider his \nextramarital affair as disqualifying outside of the falsification allegation under Guideline E. However, it is \nappropriate for examination under the whole-person concept. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant \nserved honorably as a linguist. However, the record lacks information to support a finding \nthat he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. He has placed \nhimself in a position that could easily lend itself to coercion by participating in an \nextramarital affair with a foreign national, and concealing that relationship from his then \npregnant wife. His indiscretion was recent, and he has provided no evidence of \nrehabilitation. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light \nof all pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. He \nfailed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for \nforeign influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n     FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility is denied. \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Findings of Fact Applicant is 50 years old, and he was born in what is now South Sudan. In 1999, Applicant and his wife fled Sudan and entered the United States. They were persecuted by the Sudanese government due to their religion. Applicant and his wife were naturalized in 2005. He has been married to his wife since 1999, and they have five children between the ages of 8 and 18, all of whom were born in the United States. (Tr. 27-28, 101; GE 1; GE 3 at 2, 8; AE H) In 1995, Applicant received a college degree from a school in South Sudan, and he has completed some college courses in the U.S. Between June 2006 and January 2009, he served as a linguist in Iraq with the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps. During this period, he was in Fallujah, Ramadi, and Baghdad, and subject to live fire. He was granted a secret security clearance in 2006, and he received a top secret, sensitive- compartmented information clearance in 2008. He is sponsored by a defense contractor and requires a clearance for this position. (Tr. 17, 25-26, 30-35; GE 1; GE 3 at 2) After Applicant returned to the United States from Iraq in January 2009, he was unemployed for eight months. He was then employed by a defense contractor from August 2009 until late 2011, when his position was eliminated.

His longstanding U.S. \nties to the United States mitigate security concerns raised by his familial relations in South \nSudan. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nHistory of Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 18, 2017. \nOn November 17, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and B. Applicant answered \nthe SOR on November 30, 2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nI was assigned to the case on January 30, 2019. On April 1, 2019, I issued an \norder to both parties to produce their documentary evidence by April 29, 2019. On April \n5, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for May 15, 2019, and I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F, were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant, his wife, and another witness testified. I received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on May 29, 2019. The record was held open until July 8, 2019, to allow \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nApplicant to submit additional documentation. He timely submitted AE G through I, which \nare admitted without objection, and the record is closed. \nSOR Amendment \nDuring the hearing, I amended the SOR to conform to the record evidence, \npursuant to Paragraph 17 of the Additional Procedural Guidance of the Directive. I \nchanged SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c to read, \u201cYour mother, sister, and sister-in-law are citizens \nof South Sudan, residing in Uganda.\u201d There were no objections to the amendment to the \nSOR. (Tr. 69-70) \n \nAdministrative Notice \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning the Republic of South Sudan (South \nSudan). Those facts are set forth in the Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice \nfor South Sudan, marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. These documents are included in the \nrecord. The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and \nmatters not subject to reasonable dispute. Those facts are set out in the Findings of Fact, \nbelow.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 50 years old, and he was born in what is now South Sudan. In 1999, \nApplicant and his wife fled Sudan and entered the United States. They were persecuted \nby the Sudanese government due to their religion. Applicant and his wife were naturalized \nin 2005. He has been married to his wife since 1999, and they have five children between \nthe ages of 8 and 18, all of whom were born in the United States. (Tr. 27-28, 101; GE 1; \nGE 3 at 2, 8; AE H) \nIn 1995, Applicant received a college degree from a school in South Sudan, and \nhe has completed some college courses in the U.S. Between June 2006 and January \n2009, he served as a linguist in Iraq with the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps. During \nthis period, he was in Fallujah, Ramadi, and Baghdad, and subject to live fire. He was \ngranted a secret security clearance in 2006, and he received a top secret, sensitive-\ncompartmented information clearance in 2008. He is sponsored by a defense contractor \nand requires a clearance for this position. (Tr. 17, 25-26, 30-35; GE 1; GE 3 at 2) \nAfter Applicant returned to the United States from Iraq in January 2009, he was \nunemployed for eight months. He was then employed by a defense contractor from \nAugust 2009 until late 2011, when his position was eliminated. Applicant struggled to \nregain employment, and as a result, in the spring of 2009, he and his wife started a \ntrucking company. They owned a tractor-trailer truck, leased trailers, and hired operators \nto drive their truck. They closed the business in 2012. (Tr. 17-18, 35-39; GE 1 at 18-21; \nAE C) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nIn approximately May 2012, an individual filed a lawsuit against Applicant and his \ncompany for $75,000. The plaintiff was supposed to buy Applicant\u2019s truck, but the plaintiff \nmisplaced a trailer; as a result, Applicant cancelled the transfer of title for the truck. In \nMay 2019, the lawsuit against Applicant was dismissed. In June 2019, the lawsuit against \nApplicant\u2019s company was dismissed. At this time, there are no ongoing lawsuits against \nApplicant or his company. (Tr. 37-39, 45-46; GE 1 at 71; GE 2 at 3; AE E; AE F; AE I)  \n \nAfter Applicant closed his trucking company in 2012, he was unemployed for \nseveral months. To support his family, he moved to another state and drove a cab for \napproximately one year. In 2014, Applicant and his wife opened a restaurant together. \nBecause the restaurant was not doing well, Applicant worked for other businesses \nbetween May 2017 and February 2018. At that time, they closed the restaurant because \nit was not profitable. Applicant currently drives a supply truck and restocks gas stations \nwith vending supplies. His wife owns a cleaning business, and together they cater events \nseveral times a year. (Tr. 41-44; GE 1 at 13-18; GE 2 at 2)  \n \nDue to Applicant\u2019s inability to find consistent employment and the two failed \nbusiness ventures, he fell behind on his mortgage payments. Applicant filed for Chapter \n13 bankruptcy protection in April 2016 to avoid foreclosure. His monthly mortgage \npayment was $1,500, and the monthly bankruptcy payment was $1,000. Because his \nrestaurant was not doing well, he was unable to make the required bankruptcy payments, \nand the bankruptcy was dismissed in November 2017. (Tr. 47-49, 97; GE 1 at 68-69; GE \n2 at 3-4; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 2; GE 7) \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October 2017, and the plan \nwas confirmed in March 2018. Since the confirmation of the bankruptcy plan, he has made \nmonthly payments of $3,800. His mortgage is included in the bankruptcy plan as well as \nthe credit card debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d. (Tr. 49-51, 54-56, 60; GE 4 at 4; GE \n5 at 2; GE 8) \n \nApplicant and his wife follow a written budget, and they attended a Dave Ramsey \ncredit-counseling class through their church. They also received credit counseling in \nconjunction with their bankruptcies. They have no outstanding debts related to their \nformer businesses. They owe no new outstanding income taxes and have timely filed \ntheir income tax returns for the past several tax years. Applicant brought to the hearing a \n$3,800 money order that reflected his March bankruptcy payment. After the hearing, \nApplicant provided a spreadsheet reflecting the payments he made between March and \nMay 2019 to the bankruptcy plan. Although he did not provide documentation of all of the \npayments he has made since March 2018, when the plan was confirmed, he and his wife \ntestified credibly that he has been making the required monthly payments. The \ngovernment offered no evidence to rebut his claims, and the admitted credit reports do \nnot show any new unalleged debts. (Tr. 61, 97-100, 104; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6) \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nSouth Sudan \nSouth Sudan became an independent presidential republic in July 2011, when it \ngained its independence from Sudan. Shortly thereafter, conflict arose between the \ngovernment and opposition forces, and it is an ongoing issue. Additionally, there has been \nborder conflict between South Sudan and Sudan and South Sudan and Uganda. As a \nresult, over a million people have been displaced and tens of thousands were killed. Due \nto ongoing armed conflict, crime, human rights issues, including extrajudicial killings, \nabuse, rape, and abduction, the U.S. Government advises against travel to South Sudan. \nSouth Sudan is not known for intelligence-collection efforts against the United States or \nU.S. citizens. \n  \n \nThe Government did not request that I take administrative notice of any facts or \nissues related to Uganda. (Tr. 83) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s half-brother, stepbrother, and brother-in-law \n(sister\u2019s husband) are citizens and residents of South Sudan, and they currently serve in \nthe South Sudanese Army. Applicant testified that all of these men are still citizens and \nresidents of South Sudan. He has not seen his half-brother since approximately 1997, \nand the last time he spoke to him was in 2008. Applicant heard that his stepbrother is a \nmajor in the South Sudan Army. Applicant met his stepbrother once when he was young \nand was still living in Sudan, and he spoke to him once in 2005. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-\nlaw is also an officer in the South Sudan Army. Applicant saw him in 2007, when Applicant \nvisited his mother in Uganda, but he does not communicate with his brother-in-law. \nApplicant does not know the positions, titles, or responsibilities of these relatives within \nthe South Sudan Army. (Tr. 62-68, 79; GE 3 at 3-4) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s sisters-in-law are citizens and residents of South \nSudan, and they work for the South Sudan Ministry of Finance. Applicant testified that \nboth women fled South Sudan as a result of the conflict, and they now reside in Uganda. \nNeither sister-in-law currently works for the South Sudan Ministry of Finance. (Tr. 67-68; \nGE 3 at 3-4) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother, sister, and sister-in-laws are citizens of \nSouth Sudan who reside in Uganda. Applicant\u2019s mother is a U.S. legal-permanent \nresident and previously resided with his family in the United States from 2008 until 2011. \nApplicant has not seen her since 2011. They speak approximately once a month, and he \nprovides her with less than $1,000 a year in financial support. Since 2000, he has sent \nher a total of approximately $15,000. He has no financial assets in South Sudan. (Tr. 68, \n70-72, 82-83; GE 3 at 3-4; AE B) \n \nThe last time Applicant saw his sister was in 2007, when he went to Uganda for a \nfamily gathering or reunion. She cares for their mother. (Tr. 73) The last time he saw his \nsister-in-law was in the 1980s, and she is a homemaker. (Tr. 74) \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s father-in-law, mother-in-law, brothers-in-law, and \nsisters-in-law are citizens and residents of South Sudan. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and \nfather-in-law reside in the United States with one of their sons, who is a naturalized citizen. \nThey are in the process of obtaining their Green Cards. One sister-in-law and one brother-\nin-law are residents of Australia. Three of his sisters-in-law are residents of Uganda, and \nthey are in the process of moving to Australia. One sister-in-law resides in India, and she \nis in the process of moving to Australia. One sister-in-law resides in the United States. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s eight siblings currently reside in South Sudan. (Tr. 75-77, 80-\n82, 95-97; GE 3 at 4-5) \n \nApplicant\u2019s \nformer \nco-worker \ntestified \nto \nApplicant\u2019s \ngood \ncharacter, \ntrustworthiness, sense of responsibility, and loyalty to the United States. The witness also \nserved as a linguist in Iraq for a significant period. They met in 2009 and worked together \nuntil approximately 2011. The witness has held a security clearance and recommended \nthat Applicant receive a clearance. (Tr. 87-94) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified about how hard he has worked to support their family, \napplying for many positions, and even cutting the grass for fellow church members. He is \na responsible and loyal person and wants to serve his country. Their family is involved in \nthe church, and their oldest daughter is attending a U.S. college this fall on a full \nscholarship. (Tr. 100-107) \n \nDuring his Iraq deployment, Applicant was awarded several command coins to \nsignify the service he provided to various military commands. Additionally, he received a \nletter of appreciation related to his service in Iraq. The Marine officer described Applicant \nas invaluable, diligent, responsible, hardworking, and devoted despite the duress of \nenemy fire. The Marines with whom Applicant worked relied upon his linguist skills in \n\u201ccountless tactical interrogations, convoys, foot patrols, detainee screenings, and \ndocument exploitations.\u201d (Tr. 108; AE C; AE D) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(c) \n(\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate those security concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nOver the years, Applicant experienced several professional setbacks that were\nbeyond his control. After he returned from Iraq in January 2009, he struggled to find\nsteady and gainful employment to support his wife and five children. In an effort to support\nhis family, he established a trucking company and owned a restaurant, both of which\nproved unprofitable. He drove a cab and mowed lawns in an effort to support his family.  \n \nAs a result of his unsteady income, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \n2016 and in 2017. He testified that he has been making his monthly bankruptcy payments, \nas required, since the plan was confirmed in March 2018. He provided some \ndocumentation to support his claims. Although he did not provide a status update for the \nbankruptcy or proof of all of his payments, his credible testimony demonstrates that he \nhas made a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors and resolve his debts. \nAdditionally, he has no new debts; files his state and Federal income-tax returns in a \ntimely manner; follows a written budget; and has attended credit counseling. Finally, the \nlawsuit against Applicant was resolved in his favor. \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \nThere is sufficient evidence to show that Applicant\u2019s finances are in good standing \nand he acted responsibly to address the alleged delinquent debts. Mitigation under AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) was established.  \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \nApplicant has several family members who are citizens of South Sudan but reside \nin Uganda. They fled South Sudan due to the armed conflict and have lived in Uganda \nsince at least 2007, when he last visited them. The Government did not provide evidence \nthat Uganda is a country of heighted risk or concern. Nor do these family members appear \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nto be in positions that they would be subject to foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant has limited ongoing familial connections with his half-brother, \nstepbrother, and brother-in-law who all serve in the South Sudan Army. These \nrelationships create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause of the risk of armed conflict in South Sudan. The evidence and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAt this time, Applicant has only three foreign contacts who continue to reside in \nSouth Sudan. Although they are employed by the South Sudan Army, he has had very \nlimited contact with them for at least ten years. His relationships with these individuals is \ncasual and infrequent.  \nApplicant has significant familial and financial ties to the United States. He owns \nhis own home, and his wife has a business in the United States. Their children were all \nborn in the United States and several of their extended family members have immigrated \nto the United States. Applicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Iraq demonstrates his sense \nof obligation to the United States outweighs his foreign relationships.  \n \n \nSecurity-clearance determinations are predictive judgments as to whether an \nindividual will safeguard classified information. The DOHA Appeal Board has identified \n\u201can exception in Guideline B cases in which applicants demonstrate that they have made \nsignificant contributions to national security in dangerous, high-risk circumstances.\u201d ISCR \n\n \n \n \n \n10 \nCase No. 10-05329 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 17, 2011). In this case, Applicant demonstrated \nhis significant contributions to national security while serving in high-risk combat \nenvironments on multiple assignments totaling 27 months. U.S. Military personnel \nrepeatedly and unreservedly entrusted Applicant with their lives and attested to \nApplicant\u2019s work performance and character in dangerous environments. Mitigation under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) was established. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has lived in the United \nStates for approximately 20 years, he served in Iraq, under fire, for over two years, and \nwas an invaluable member of the teams with which he served. Despite struggling \nfinancially after his deployments, he has worked hard to regain steady employment and \nresolve his debts through a bankruptcy. His connections and ties to the United States \nclearly outweigh any connections to a foreign country, and his family members who \ncontinue to reside in South Sudan and Uganda are either casual or they are not in \npositions that would cause a heightened risk.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns at issue. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the United States to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n \n \n \n11 \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant  \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n___________________________\nCAROLINE E.

On July 6, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DODCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective June 8, 2017.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 7, 2018, and subsequently \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) received the request on or about August 29, 2018. I received the \ncase assignment on August 30, 2018. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on September \n11, 2018, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 2, 2018. The \nGovernment offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 3, which were received into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A and B, without \n\n \n2 \n \n \nobjection. He also asked that the record be kept open until November 2, 2018, for the \nreceipt of additional documentation.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \n\n \n3 \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \n \nAppellant smoked marijuana for about 17 years, from about 1987~1996, and \nfrom about 2010~2017. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), and (c ) are established.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant ceased his marijuana use about 18 months ago, only after being \ninterviewed by a DOD investigator. However, during that interview Applicant averred \nthat he intended to use the illegal substance in the future. I find that not enough time \nhas passed to believe that Applicant will now adhere to his new averment. Guideline H \nis found against Applicant.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nRichard A.

The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems. He has not made a good-faith effort to resolve more than $50,000 in \ndelinquent debt. He also failed to timely file state and federal tax returns in recent tax \nyears. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non February 9, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on June 8, 2018, after reviewing the application and \nthe information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \n\n \n2 \n \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 21, 2017. He provided handwritten \nresponses on the SOR in which he admitted all the SOR allegations. Neither Applicant \nnor Department Counsel requested a hearing, but the case was inadvertently processed \nfor a hearing. This error was discovered during the June 2019 hearing, and Applicant \nstated he wanted to proceed with a hearing. (Tr. 12-15). \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on September 24, 2018. Applicant failed to appear \nfor a hearing scheduled for December 3, 2018. Upon due consideration, I granted \nApplicant\u2019s e-mail request to grant him an extension of time so he could pursue \nretaining an attorney to represent him. The hearing took place as rescheduled on June \n12, 2019. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department Counsel offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-6. Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A (a June 6, 2019 biweekly pay \nstatement) and B (a June 2019 credit report). Other than Applicant, no witnesses were \ncalled. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on June 25, 2019.   \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nAt the close of the evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r \nand 1.s, so as to render those allegations in conformity with the evidence admitted. (Tr. \n58-62). I granted the motion on SOR \u00b6 1.r, by adding tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018 to \nthe allegation that Applicant failed to timely file a state income tax return in 2014. The \nbasis for the amendment was Applicant\u2019s unequivocal and certain statements that he \nhad not filed a state income tax return since moving to his current state of residence in \n2016. I denied the motion on SOR \u00b6 1.s, to include additional tax years to the allegation \nthat Applicant failed to timely file a federal income tax return in 2014. Denial was \nappropriate because Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony, which was the basis for the \namendment, was too uncertain and conflicting to rely on. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. He is employed as a material program manager in the field \nof supply-chain management for a company in the defense industry. He has been so \nemployed since July 2016. His biweekly base pay is $3,401, or an annual salary of \nabout $81,624. (Exhibit A) He relocated to his current state of residence in mid-2016. \nHe attended college for many years, apparently on a part-time basis, during 1992-2001. \nHe was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999. He married in 2001 and divorced in 2005. \nHe has one child from the marriage. He has another child from a previous relationship. \nHe pays child support on an informal basis or agreement without the benefit of a court \norder or written agreement.    \n \nApplicant had a full-time job as a procurement agent for a large aerospace \ncompany from June 2002 to November 2014, when he was laid off due to a reduction in \n\n \n3 \n \nforce. As a result, he received an unspecified amount of severance pay. He was then \nunemployed or under employed until he began his current job in July 2016. He was out \nof work from December 2014 to May 2015. He worked as a consultant from May 2015 \nto April 2016, and was unemployed from May 2016 to July 2016. During the period of \nunemployment in 2015, he cashed out a 401(k) account from his previous employer, \nwhich withheld the tax due and the 10% penalty.  \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of failure to timely \nfile state and federal tax returns and 17 delinquent accounts, either charged off or in \ncollection, for about $69,341 in total. Twelve of the delinquent accounts are student \nloans for about $49,658 in total, which Applicant used to attend college during 1999-\n2001. The other five delinquent accounts are credit card accounts from major banks. \nFour of these accounts were reduced to judgment, by default, as reflected in county \ncourt records from 2017 and 2018. (Exhibit 2) Department Counsel agreed that the \n$5,000 unpaid judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.t was a duplication of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c or \n1.f. In addition to his admissions, the delinquent accounts are established by the \ndocumentary evidence (Exhibits 2-6). In both his answer to the SOR and in his hearing \ntestimony, he attributed his financial problems to his 2014 job layoff and the resulting \nperiod of unemployment and under employment.  \n \nApplicant has made some progress in repaying the delinquent credit card \naccounts. The $6,144 charge-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.c was reduced to judgment and \npaid off through wage garnishment with a date of last payment in November 2018. (Tr. \n33, 38-41; Exhibit B at 11) Likewise, the $4,489 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.f was \nreduced to judgment and is being repaid through wage garnishment at the rate of $335 \nper pay period, with $1,005 paid to date. (Tr. 33-34, 39-40; Exhibit A) For the other \nthree delinquent credit card accounts, two of which were reduced to judgment, Applicant \nstated that he is attempting to negotiate a payment arrangement with the creditors. (Tr. \n34-35, 41-43) In addition to the wage garnishments, Applicant has two loans against his \ncurrent 401(k) account. (Exhibit A; Tr. 53-54)  \n \nConcerning the delinquent student loans, Applicant is currently paying $436 per \npay period on those accounts, although he was uncertain if the payment was being \nmade directly to the Department of Education or a collection firm. (Tr. 32-33; Exhibit A) \nHe did not present a current account statement for the student loans. (Tr. 33) He \nestimated the current balance on the student loan accounts is about $50,000. (Tr. 55) \nThe student loan accounts were also reduced to a judgment, which is being paid \nthrough wage garnishment. (Tr. 43-44; Exhibit A) \n \nTurning to the tax matters, Applicant admitted failure to timely file an income tax \nreturn for tax year 2014 in his state of previous residence. (Tr. 36-37) He also admitted \nfailure to timely file income tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018 in his state of \nresidence since 2016. (Tr. 51-52) And he admitted failure to timely file a federal income \ntax return for tax year 2014. (Tr. 36-37) To date, neither the state nor federal returns \nhave been filed. He did not present any documentation from the state tax authorities or \nthe IRS. He admitted that his failure to timely file returns was due to oversight and \nfailure on his part. (Tr. 44) In light of the wage garnishments, he admitted reducing his \n\n \n4 \n \ntax withholdings to pay less tax and receive more income, which has resulted in having \ntax due when returns were required to be filed. (Tr. 44-46)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, it appears the genesis of Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems was the November 2014 job layoff. That event resulted in a nearly two-year \nperiod of unemployment and underemployment, which would be a difficult setback for \n\n \n6 \n \nanyone. Still, Applicant received severance pay, cashed out a 401(k) account, and had \nsome earned income during this period, so he was not completely without funds. \nFurther, his unemployment and under employment did not prevent him from timely filing \nstate and federal income tax returns. Given these circumstances, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(c) applies, but only in part, and Applicant receives limited credit in \nmitigation.  \n \n \nConcerning the delinquent student loan and credit card accounts for more than \n$60,000, Applicant has not made \u201ca good-faith effort\u201d to resolve those matters. Although \none of the charged-off card accounts was repaid and another is being repaid, that \noccurred due to wage garnishments to enforce money judgments, not voluntary \npayment plans arranged by Applicant. The same goes for the payments on the student \nloan accounts, which were reduced to a judgment and are being repaid through a wage \ngarnishment. Given these circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) does \nnot apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has not made any progress in resolving the tax matters. The state and \nfederal tax returns for tax year 2014 remain unfiled. What is more, Applicant has not \ngotten around to filing a state income tax return since relocating to his current state of \nresidence in 2016. He presented no documentation from the state and federal tax \nauthorities. He is a long way from being in compliance with state and federal tax \nauthorities. Given these circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(g) does not \napply.   \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.s:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n     Statement of the Case \nOn June 11, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Applicant answered the SOR on \nJuly 5, 2018, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing.  \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) on August 16, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on August 24, 2018, and \nhad 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Applicant did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence, and he provided an \nundated, two-page response to the FORM, with attachments including two character \nreferences, and a printout of a two-year payment history of child support payments \nmade in 2017 and 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence, was identified as Items one \n01/04/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthrough six. All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on December 31, 2018.  \n \n Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. He graduated from high school in 1988, and completed \nsome community college courses, but did not obtain a degree. Applicant has been \nemployed as a document preparation clerk by a federal contractor since October 2016. \nHe was married in 1990 and divorced in 2004, and he remarried in 2007. He reports a \nson, age 18, and a daughter, age 15, and he has two-adult stepchildren. Applicant \nstates that he had periods of unemployment including: October 2009 to October 2010; \nOctober 2013 to February 2014; August 2014 to May 2015; and November 2015 to \nJune 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1989 to 1995 and earned an \nhonorable discharge. He continues to serve in the Army Reserve and recently was \npromoted to sergeant first class. Applicant said he was deployed to Iraq for 15 months \nwhile he served on active duty at a U.S. base from October 2010 to October 2013.2 \n \nApplicant disclosed an arrest in November 2015 for misapplying entrusted \nfederal property in section 22 of his Security Clearance Application (SCA).3 He pled \nguilty in March 2016 to this misdemeanor offense and paid a $300 fine and $800 in \ncourt costs. He admitted to dumping several flyers and newsletters in a dumpster while \nhe was employed as a letter carrier with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Applicant \nstated he resigned from the USPS under adverse circumstances but he was not \nterminated.4   \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR (Answer), Applicant admitted two of the three \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR totaling $37,340, Including the $36,532 child \nsupport arrearage alleged at SOR 1.a. He denied the debt placed for collection in the \namount of $237 at SOR \u00b6 1.c, stating that this account was paid in full as of June 22, \n2018. He attached a receipt documenting this payment to his Answer to the SOR. He \nalso attached an \u201cIncome Withholding for Support\u201d agreement that he entered into with \nhis employer on February 16, 2018. This required Applicant to pay $1,012 per month in \nchild support based on an order from the county court in state A.  \n \n The child support arrearage arose because although Applicant pays child \nsupport, his payments have been sporadic due to chronic unemployment.5 His first \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s February 19, 2017 \nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA). (Item 3) \n \n2 Item 4. \n \n3 Item 3.  \n \n4 Item 4.  \n \n5  Items 4 and 5.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmarriage in 1990 was to a German national. They had a son and a daughter together. \nApplicant has had no contact with his son since 2004. Starting in 2006, a county court \nordered that Applicant\u2019s pay be garnished in the amount of $1,052 and sent to Germany \nvia the county court in state A. This court order was reaffirmed in 2014. Applicant \nattached a one-page payment history to his response to the FORM, reflecting child \nsupport payments of $425 every two weeks in 2017, and $506 every two weeks (or \n$1,012 a month) in 2018, in compliance with the income withholding for support \nagreement. The last reported payment was made on August 17, 2018. He also attached \ntwo character reference letters attesting to his work ethic, integrity and trustworthiness.   \n \n He admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, for an automobile loan that is past due \nin the approximate amount of $571, with a total balance of $7,131. In his clearance \ninterview, applicant claimed that he opened this account in 2005, and he eventually \ngave the vehicle to a friend who was supposed to take over payments on the loan. The \nfriend reneged on his promise to make payments and Applicant attached a letter from \nthe creditor dated June 26, 2018, to his Answer. It reflects a payment in the amount of \n$291 was verbally authorized in June 2018, and Applicant was supposed to continue \nmaking monthly payments on this automobile loan, pursuant to this verbal agreement. \nHowever, Applicant has provided no documents or evidence of the payment agreement, \naside from this one-time payment, to support his claims. \n \n In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant also admitted the allegation under SOR \u00b6 \n2.a for personal conduct, his conviction for depositing postal flyers in the trash, with an \nexplanation. He was already punished for this misconduct on the job as a letter carrier, \nwhen he paid court costs and a fine. He felt pressure to complete his mail route in a \nfinite amount of time, which did not allow for additional advertising flyers to be delivered. \nHe was also forced to resign under adverse conditions.    \n \n \n                                            \nPolicies \n \n \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful \nweighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and   \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are confirmed by his credit \nreports, answer to the SOR, and his clearance interviews. The Government produced \nsubstantial evidence to support the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c), \nthereby shifting the burden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.6 Applicant has not met that burden. Only one of the \ndelinquent debts has been resolved, the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control, and the individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances;     \n                                                          \n6 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant endured multiple periods of unemployment. Arguably, this condition \nwas beyond his control. He bears some responsibility for his forced resignation as a \nletter carrier for misconduct. However, it is unclear what efforts he made to find \nemployment. He made only sporadic child support payments, before being ordered to \ndo so by the county court. He admits to an arrearage of more than $36,000. He did \nattach an income withholding for support agreement to his Answer, but it started in \nFebruary 2018. His efforts are too little, too late. He has produced two favorable \ncharacter references, but no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. \n \n \n Applicant attached to his response to the FORM, a payment history showing \nchild support payments made in 2017 and 2018, but he stated that these payments \nwere ordered initially in 2006, and reaffirmed by the county court in 2014. It is unclear \nwhat payments, if any, he made before 2017. It is equally unclear why he was \nunemployed so frequently.   \n \n \nApplicant did produce evidence of one payment in the amount of $291 on his \ndelinquent automobile loan at the end of June 2018. This is evidence of at least one \nrepayment on this debt, presumably pursuant to a plan. He also demonstrated that the \ndebt at SOR \u00b6 1.c is paid in full. Yet, these efforts were on the eve of his FORM. SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b have not been resolved. In short, he has provided insufficient \ndocumentation to mitigate the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. His child support \nobligations are longstanding and unfulfilled. The alleged debts are recent and ongoing. \nHe has not demonstrated that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant \nhas the burden to provide sufficient evidence to show that his financial problems are \nunder control, and that his debts were incurred under circumstances making them \nunlikely to recur. The mitigating conditions enumerated above do not apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes . . . .  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgement, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics, indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, considerations of:  \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of government or other employer\u2019s time \nor resources; and \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to  \nthe employer as a condition of employment.  \nSince Applicant admitted his untrustworthy behavior and misdemeanor \nmisconduct as a letter carrier, he has not mitigated the government\u2019s concern. He had a \nfiduciary responsibility to his postal service customers when he was entrusted with their \nmail for delivery. He misused USPS time and resources. Although there is no evidence \nof a contract or writing, it is self-evident that his commitment to the USPS was to deliver \nthe mail entrusted to him. He dumped it for his own convenience in expediting \ncompletion of his route. Insufficient time has passed since he committed this offense to \nconclude that Applicant would act reliably if he was entrusted with classified information.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns \ninclude: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged his aberrant behavior by pleading guilty to the \nmisdemeanor charge of misapplying entrusted federal property and disclosing his \nconviction in his SCA. He alleviated stressors and changed his circumstances by \nresigning his job under pressure. Since his arrest and conviction are public matters and \nhe disclosed them, there is no vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nHowever, Applicant provided no evidence of counseling, and insufficient time has \nelapsed from his offense, to conclude that it won\u2019t recur. His conviction cuts to the heart \nof the matter of special trust and confidence being placed in persons holding security \nclearances, and continues to cast doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant \nhas not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines. Most importantly, Applicant has \nbreached his position of trust as a letter carrier and raised concerns about his \ntrustworthiness and reliability, which have not been mitigated, and he has not mitigated \nhis delinquent debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a security concern. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. He has not met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations, or under Guideline E, personal conduct.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:             \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.c:                                  For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:                                   Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

On June 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 29, 2018.  He requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.  (Item 2.)  On \nJuly 29, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five Items, was \nmailed to Applicant on July 31, 2018, and received by him on August 7, 2018.  The \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nFORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM. Applicant failed to respond to the FORM.  Applicant did not object to Items 1 \nthrough 5, and they are admitted into evidence.  Hereinafter, they are referenced as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 5.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and is married.  He has a high school diploma and an \nHVAC certificate.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Cable Technician.  He \nis seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.   \n \n \nApplicant began working for his current employer in December 2014.  He has \nnever held a security clearance before.  Applicant admits each of the allegations set \nforth in the SOR under both the criminal conduct guideline and the personal conduct \nguideline.  He admits to a serious history of criminal conduct that began in about 1994, \nat the age of 16, which continued until at least 2006.  Applicant admits that at the age of \n16, he was convicted for attempted robbery, (a felony) and by age 28, he was convicted \nand charged with an additional four felonies.  \n \n \nAs mentioned above, in 1994, Applicant was charged with Felony Attempted \nRobbery.  Applicant and a friend attempted to steal a woman\u2019s purse, when she \nscreamed, and they ran back to his friend\u2019s house.  Five minutes later, the police arrived \nat his friend\u2019s house to arrest the Applicant.  Applicant was convicted of the charge and \nsentenced to six months detention.  (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.)   \n \n \nIn January 1999, he was charged with two counts of Assault and Battery.  He \nwas convicted of one count of Assault.  In October 1999, he was charged with Profane, \nThreatening Language Over Public Airway.  In May 2000, he was charged with \nPossession of Marijuana, and convicted of the offense.  In July 2000, Applicant was \ncharged with Destruction of Property.  He was convicted of this offense.  (Government \nExhibits 4 and 5.)   \n \n \nIn October 2000, Applicant was charged with Driving After Forfeiture of License \nand Driving After Illegally Consuming Alcohol.  Applicant stated that he was drinking \nand driving after leaving a bar.  He dropped off a friend, and then got into an accident \nwhere he wrecked his car in a storm drain.  Applicant left his car at the wreck location \nand walked home.  Five minutes later, the police arrived and Applicant was arrested.  \nHe was convicted of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, and sentenced to 6 months \nsuspended.  (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.)   \n \n \nIn March 2006, Applicant was charged with three counts of Felony Manufacture, \nSale, Possession, of Controlled Substance; Felony Possession of Firearm While in \nPossession of Drugs; Felony Sale, Distribute Marijuana; and Felony Possession of \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nControlled Substance.  Applicant\u2019s house was raided by the police department.  \nApplicant states that he not at home at the time, but his wife was, and she was charged \nwith one count of possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) and was taken to jail \nimmediately after the raid.  Applicant states that when his wife was in jail, he was \ncontacted by a police officer who told him to turn himself in or his wife would be charged \nwith all seven felony counts.  Applicant states that he turned himself in and took the \nblame for all of the charges to prevent his wife from being charged for all of them.  \nApplicant contends that the firearms were not his, but belonged to, and were registered \nto a friend, consisting of two handguns.  Applicant\u2019s stated that his friend had left the \nfirearms at his house, as they would go to the shooting range together.  Applicant also \ncontends that the drugs were not his and that he did not purchase them.  In fact, he \nstates that he does not know how they ended up in his bedroom.  Applicant was initially \ncharged with seven felonies consisting of two firearm charges and five substance \ncharges which included psilocybin, marijuana, hash, mescaline and cocaine.  These \ncharges were dropped to four felonies. On May 1, 2007, Applicant pled guilty to and \nwas convicted of two felony counts of Possession with Intent to Distribute and two \nfelony counts of Possession of Firearm while in Possession of Drugs.  Applicant was \nsentenced to 20 years in prison with 15 years suspended.  He was incarcerated for five \nyears from May 2007 to about November 2012.  He was then placed on parole for three \nyears.  (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.)     \n \n \nApplicant states that he no longer associates with the people who were involved \nin his prior convictions.  He further states that he does not smoke, drink, or use drugs \nanymore.  He now spends his time with his family, watching movies and going to work.  \n(Government Exhibit 5.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matter of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless \nof whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or \nconvicted. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Although over ten years has \npassed since Applicant\u2019s last conviction and imprisonment, he has not established that \nhe is sufficiently reliable and trustworthy to access classified information.  Applicant has \nbeen convicted of at least six felonies for various criminal conduct discussed above.  \nThe offenses give rise to serious concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because of the nature of the offenses, and the circumstances \nsurrounding the offense.  The beforementioned disqualifying conditions have been \nestablished.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15. \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation.  This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and  \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Applicant has failed to provide \nany evidence in mitigation.   \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 39-year-old \nadult, who has an extensive criminal history that displays poor judgment and \nunreliability.  Applicant has also failed to provide any evidence in mitigation.  At this \npoint, Applicant has not demonstrated sufficient responsibility on any level to be eligible \nfor access to classified information.  Overall the record evidence leaves me with serious \ndoubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He \nhas not met his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guidelines for \nCriminal Conduct and Personal Conduct. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his Federal and State income tax returns as required for tax years 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014. He also failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. Applicant failed to pay his 2003 Federal income taxes and they were been written off by the IRS in 2015. He owes approximately $23,579 in Federal back taxes and approximately $17,262 for four other delinquent debts. In his answer, Applicant admitted allegations 1.a., through 1.k., and 1.o.

He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his Federal and State income tax \nreturns as required for tax years 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and \n2014.   He also failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2015 and 2016.  Applicant failed to pay his 2003 Federal income taxes and they were \nbeen written off by the IRS in 2015.  He owes approximately $23,579 in Federal back \ntaxes and approximately $17,262 for four other delinquent debts.  In his answer, \nApplicant admitted allegations 1.a., through 1.k., and 1.o.  He was not aware of the \ndebts set forth in allegations 1.l., 1.m., and 1.n.   \n \n Applicant began working for his current employer in 2006 and worked there until \n2009.  He was rehired in 2015 and he has worked there since then.  On August 23, \n2018, Applicant was offered a promotion if he is able to obtain a security clearance.  \nCredit Reports of the Applicant dated August 10, 2017; and February 20, 2019, confirm \neach of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) \n \nApplicant experienced several long periods of unemployment that has affected \nhis ability to pay his debts.  He was unemployed from September 2008 to August 2009; \nDecember 2009 to October 2012; June 2013 to September 2014; and June 2015 to \nMarch 2016.  He states that due to a bad economy, he was unable to find a suitable job.  \nDuring these periods, he collected unemployment benefits.  However, being off work for \nso long, he became depressed, overwhelmed and despondent.  The little money he did \nhave he used to pay his rent and to survive.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.)  He \nstates that he did not file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2002, \n2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014 because he did not have \nthe money to file or pay his taxes.   \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant also did not timely file his Federal or State income tax returns for tax \nyears 2015 and 2016.  As a result of not filing his 2003 Federal income tax returns, his \nbalance was written off by the IRS in 2015.  Applicant\u2019s status report from the state tax \nauthority dated December 5, 2018, indicates that as of that date, Applicant had filed his \n2011, 2015, 2016 and 2017 state income tax returns.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)   \n \nApplicant currently owes Federal income taxes for tax years 2006, in the amount \nof $3,191; 2007, in the amount of $3,714; 2008, in the amount of $1,297.51; 2015, in \nthe amount of $9,074.05; 2016, in the amount of $2,662.21; and 2017, in the amount of \n$3,639.84.  These taxes have not been paid and remain outstanding.  Applicant states \nthat he plans to start a payment plan with the IRS to resolve this debt in June 2019.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.) \n \nApplicant initially testified that all Federal and state income tax returns have been \nfiled and everything has been cleared up.  (Tr. p. 52.)  Applicant had no proof of filing \nwith him, nor proof that he has paid his back Federal and/or state taxes.  Applicant \nstated that he started filing his taxes about three years ago, when he started working for \nhis current employer.  The record was left open after the hearing to allow the Applicant \nto provide this documentation.   Applicant did not provide it.  Applicant also testified that \nif he receives his security clearance, the financial matters will be fixed immediately.  He \nwill be promoted and assigned overseas, and the new job will allow him to be able to \npay his delinquent taxes and other debts.  (Tr. pp. 60-62.)  Applicant stated that he is \nnot currently on a payment plan with the IRS, but he plans to set up a payment plan and \nbegin payments by next month.  (Tr. p. 62.) \n \nApplicant contends that in early 2018, his personal information was stolen and \nthings have appeared on his credit report that he is not aware of, and that should not be \nthere.  Applicant is disputing some of the delinquent debts listed on his creditor reports, \nand has placed a credit freeze and credit monitoring through the credit bureaus on his \nreports.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.) He initially thought that the following \ndebts were not his: \n \n1.l.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $524.  Government Exhibit 4 indicates that the account was \nopened in 2016. Therefore, this debt had nothing to do with identity theft that took place \nin 2018.  Also, Government Exhibit 2 shows that Applicant discussed the debt at length \nwith the interviewer.  Applicant now believes that it could be his debt.  Applicant recently \nlocated a copy of the \u201creturn receipt\u201d showing that he returned the equipment to the \ncreditor and that there is no balance owed.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.)  \nApplicant states that he is making sure that the debt is being removed from his credit \nreports.   \n \n1.m.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $1,119.  Government Exhibit 3 indicates that the account was \nopened in June 2013.  Therefore, this debt had nothing to do with identity theft that took \nplace in 2018.  Applicant now believes the debt could be his debt.  (Tr. p. 68.)  In fact, \n\n \n4 \n \nduring his interview with the investigator, Applicant disputed the debt because he \nthought he had paid it, but he does not know for sure.  (Government Exhibit 2 and Tr. p. \n69.)  Since the debt does not appear on the Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report, it will \nbe assumed that the debt was paid.  (Tr. p. 70.) \n \n1.n.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount \nof $619.  Government Exhibit 4 shows that the account was opened December 2016.  \nTherefore, this debt had nothing to do with identity theft that took place in 2018.  \nApplicant also discussed the debt with the investigator and stated that he disputed the \ndebt.  (Government Exhibit 2 and Tr. p. 71.)  Since the debt does not appear on \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit report, and Applicant states that he did not pay it, it is \nassumed to be successfully disputed.  (Tr. p. 72.)   \n \n1.o.  A delinquent debt to a creditor in the approximate amount of $15,000 is \nbeing paid by the Applicant through garnishment.  Applicant pays $250 every pay period \ntoward the debt.  Applicant states that he has now paid back $7,406 of the $7500 owed \nand when he pays it off in full, (when the garnishment is completed on June 1, 2019), he \nwill begin a payment plan with the IRS.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.)    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A is a notice of account dispute, indicating that a \ncreditor has been removed from Applicant\u2019s credit report.  The creditor is not one that is \nlisted in the SOR.  Applicant has never received any financial counseling to improve his \nfinances.  He is not adverse to the idea and believes it could be helpful. \n \n \nApplicant admits to his financial mistakes of the past.  He indicates that he has \nsolicited advice from his financial officer concerning his tax problems and was told to \nchange his deductions on his W2 in order to avoid owing taxes at the end of the year.  \nApplicant also increased his state tax each month by $50.  Applicant states that he is \nnow taking ownership and responsibility for his finances and his life.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit B.)  \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant engaged in conduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations that raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth \nunder this guideline.  Applicant completed an e-QIP dated August 8, 2017.  Section 26, \nFinancial Record - Taxes asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years have you failed to file or pay \nFederal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?\u201d  Applicant provided \ninformation on tax years 2013, 2015 and 2016.  He failed to provide any information \nabout tax years 2010, 2012, and 2014.  (Government Exhibit 1.) \n \nIn his interrogatory response dated August 22, 2018, Applicant was asked \u201chave \nyou ever failed to file your Federal income tax returns on time? . . . if yes, list which \n\n \n5 \n \nyears you failed to file your returns on time.\u201d  Applicant failed to provide information that \nhe failed to file his Federal income tax returns on time for tax years 2002, 2004, 2005, \n2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.  (Government Exhibit 2.) \n \nIn that same interrogatory response, Applicant was asked \u201cHave you ever failed \nto file your Federal income tax returns on time? . . . if yes, list which years are not \ncurrently filed.\u201d  Applicant stated that, \u201call years have been filed.\u201d  He did not list the fact \nthat his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, \n2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014 had not been filed.  (Government Exhibit 2.) \n \nIn that same interrogatory response, Applicant was asked, \u201cHave you ever failed \nto file your state income tax returns on time? . . . if yes, list which years you failed to file \nyour state returns on time\u201d.  Applicant did not provide information that he failed to file \nstate income tax returns for tax years  2002, 2004, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, \nand 2016.   (Government Exhibit 2.) \n \nIn that same interrogatory response, Applicant was asked, \u201cHave you ever failed \nto file your state income tax returns on time? . . . if yes, list which years are not currently \nfiled\u201d.  Applicant failed to provide information that he had not filed his State income tax \nreturns for tax years 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014. \n(Government Exhibit 2.) \n \n \nApplicant explained that he is really bad with times and dates.  His memory is \nterrible.  And for the most part, he does not know why he answered the questions on his \ne-QIP and in response to the interrogatories the way he did.  He does not remember his \nmindset and at the time, he could have been thinking something completely different.  \nHe may have misunderstood the question or made a mistake.  (Tr. p. 89 \u2013 96.) \n \nPerformance appraisals of the Applicant for the years 2016, 2017, and 2018, \nreflect that he has consistently completed all of his goals, has a strong and positive \nwork relationship with his team, and has mentored new employees.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nB.) \n \nLetters of recommendation from various coworkers of the Applicant attest to his \nhard working nature and tireless efforts to maintain the highest quality of products.  He \nis considered to be an exceptional employee, who is caring, empathetic, and supportive \nto others.  If he does make a mistake, he is forthcoming and honest about them and \nfixes the problem.  He is recommended for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)   \n \nAn email correspondence from a government customer indicates that Applicant \nhas been a valuable asset to the program\u2019s efforts.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \n \n \nApplicant received both a silver award on December 10, 2018, and a copper \naward on October 27, 2017, from his employer for going above and beyond, and for \nexemplary performance and team commitment in volunteering for overtime that kept the \nprograms on track.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant has completed the requirements and received a Certificate, qualified as \na Certified IPC Specialist in Soldered Electrical and Electronic Assemblies, and qualified \nas a Certified IPC Specialist in Acceptance for Cable and Wire Harness Assemblies.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to file his Federal and state income taxes for many years.  He \ncontinues to owe delinquent back taxes and he has other delinquent debts.  He remains \nexcessively indebted.  Only one debt is being paid, and that is through garnishment \nfrom his payroll.  At this time there is insufficient information in the record to conclude \nthat he is now financially stable, that he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has the \nfinancial resources available to handle his financial obligations.  No regular monthly \npayments are being made toward his debts, nor has he shown that he has done \n\n \n8 \n \nanything about filing or paying his taxes.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file \nor pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.  \n \n           There were obviously circumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control that \ncontributed to his financial difficulties.  Applicant was unemployed for extended periods \nand could not find work.  Although he was receiving unemployment benefits and at \ntimes working odd jobs, he was not earning enough money to pay his bills.  His taxes \nand other debts fell delinquent and have not been paid.  At this point, it cannot be said \nthat he is financially stable or that he has made a good faith effort to resolve his \nindebtedness. \n  \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:       \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n\n \n9 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.   \n \n \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified his e-QIP and his interrogatories in response to \nquestions regarding his failure to file Federal and state income tax returns by failing to \ndisclose them.  Applicant clearly knew this information, or should have found the \ninformation in order to accurately list them in response to the questions.  His lack of full \ndisclosure shows poor judgment.  He did not exercise due diligence nor was he \nforthcoming in responding to the questions.  Instead, whether it was laziness or \ncarelessness, he deliberately failed to list his failure to file taxes and pay taxes in \nresponse to questions on the e-QIP and in response to his interrogatories.  The \nGovernment relies on one\u2019s responses to the questions on the e-QIP to determine ones \ntrustworthiness.  If the answers are not truthful, the Government is misled, and \nApplicant cannot be trusted.  Under the circumstances, Applicant knew or should have \nknown that he failed to file and deliberately did not list this information on his e-QIP and \nin his interrogatory responses.  There are no applicable conditions that could be \nmitigating under AG \u00b6 17.     \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:, through 1.l.    \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m.:, and 1.n. \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o.:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.: through 1.e.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline H, the Government alleged Applicant used marijuana between August 2009 and August 2016, while holding a security clearance he received in April 2009. (SOR 1.a). The same conduct was cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR 2.a). In response, Applicant admitted both allegations and provided extensive explanatory remarks, as well as numerous documents attesting to his character, reliability, lifestyle and accomplishments. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old and works as an engineer for a defense contractor. After graduating from college with a degree in electrical engineering in 2008, he was hired in February 2009 by a large defense contractor. He worked there until February 2017, when that company lost the contract on which he was working. Applicant then was hired by the company that took over the contract, working there until February 2018, when he was hired for the position he now occupies. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 38) After Applicant was hired for his first defense contractor job, he submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on February 12, 2009. In April 2009, he was granted a security clearance, which he has held ever since. Applicant first tried marijuana in August 2009 and continued to use marijuana sporadically until August 2016. He disclosed his drug use when he submitted his most recent e-QIP for",

(SOR 1.a). The same conduct was cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR 2.a). In \nresponse, Applicant admitted both allegations and provided extensive explanatory \nremarks, as well as numerous documents attesting to his character, reliability, lifestyle \nand accomplishments. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old and works as an engineer for a defense contractor. After \ngraduating from college with a degree in electrical engineering in 2008, he was hired in \nFebruary 2009 by a large defense contractor. He worked there until February 2017, when \nthat company lost the contract on which he was working. Applicant then was hired by the \ncompany that took over the contract, working there until February 2018, when he was \nhired for the position he now occupies. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 38) \n \n \nAfter Applicant was hired for his first defense contractor job, he submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on February 12, 2009. In \nApril 2009, he was granted a security clearance, which he has held ever since. Applicant \nfirst tried marijuana in August 2009 and continued to use marijuana sporadically until \nAugust 2016. He disclosed his drug use when he submitted his most recent e-QIP for \npurposes of obtaining eligibility for top secret access with eligibility for access to sensitive \ncompartmented information. He also discussed his drug use with a government \ninvestigator in August 2017. Applicant has never failed a workplace urinalysis or other \ndrug screening test. There have been no breaks in the employment for which he requires \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n \n2 The adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, \nto be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nto have access to classified information. Applicant never bought, sold, or possessed \nmarijuana. Rather, he used it when it was offered to him in social settings, such as \ncamping trips, concerts, and house parties. In 2014 and 2015, Applicant had a girlfriend \nwho frequently used marijuana for pain management, and Applicant used it a few times \nwith her. Applicant is an avid outdoorsman and engages in a variety of sports and \nendurance events each year. He averred that he stopped using marijuana in 2016 for \nhealth reasons, particularly because he was diagnosed with asthma. He was given that \ndiagnosis in 2012, but smoked marijuana on occasion thereafter. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. \n29 \u2013 36, 40 \u2013 42) \n \n \nApplicant also claimed that he was not aware of any specific proscription against \nusing marijuana as part of his employers\u2019 drug policies; however, before he was hired for \nhis jobs in 2009 and 2018, he had to pass a pre-employment drug screening. He also \nwas aware that he could be fired if he tested positive for marijuana through workplace \nscreening. Applicant never used marijuana at work or with any coworkers; nor did he ever \nuse marijuana while traveling for work assignments. While he acknowledged that he did \nnot consider the work or security ramifications of his marijuana use when it was offered \nto him, he has accepted full responsibility for his actions and has been candid and \nforthcoming to the best of his abilities about his misconduct. (Tr. 23 \u2013 28, 37) \n \n \nApplicant has an outstanding reputation among his current and past co-workers \nand supervisors, and others with whom he associates away from work. He submitted over \n20 letters of recommendation. Most of his character references were informed that he \nhad used marijuana, yet still vouched for his character and reliability. Applicant no longer \nassociates with anyone who uses illegal drugs, and he has a new girlfriend with whom he \nis in a committed relationship. She does not use drugs nor condone such conduct. Finally, \nApplicant has submitted a notarized statement of intent to abstain from illegal drug use in \nthe future. (Answer; AX A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,3 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of \nthe guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n                                                 \n3 See Directive. 6.3. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.5 A person who has access \nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based \non trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the Government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nApplicant illegally used marijuana with varying frequency between 2009 and 2016, \nat all times while he held a security clearance. This information reasonably raises a \nsecurity concern about illegal drug use that is stated at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \n                                                 \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n6 See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 25 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nThe record also supports application of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 26(b): \n  \nthe individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude Applicant is unlikely to engage in such conduct in the \nfuture. His drug use was sporadic, at most, and his circumstances have changed so as \nto make it increasingly unlikely he will use marijuana in the future. The security concerns \nunder this guideline are mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s repeated willingness to engage in illegal drug use while holding a \nsecurity clearance reasonably raises a security concern about his willingness or ability to \nadhere to rules and regulations while safeguarding sensitive information. That security \nconcern is expressed, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nMore specifically, the record evidence as a whole requires application of the \ndisqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(c): \n \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \n \nBy contrast, of the mitigating conditions listed under this guideline, only AG \u00b6 17(c) \n(the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or \nit happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is pertinent here. \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance raises broader \ndoubts about his judgment. My assessment of all of the information probative of \nApplicant\u2019s decision making in that regard leads me to conclude that either he knew he \nwas not supposed to engage in such conduct and did so anyway, or at the very least, that \nhe was willfully ignorant of his employer\u2019s drug policies and his own responsibilities under \nthose policies. If nothing else, Applicant knew or should have known that his conduct was \na violation of federal law. Such conduct undermines confidence in Applicant\u2019s willingness \nor ability to follow rules and regulations attendant to his duties as the government\u2019s \nfiduciary in safeguarding sensitive information. Applicant either decided to engage in \nillegal drug use, or he did not consider that he bore responsibilities that his friends, who \noffered him marijuana, did not.  \n \nNonetheless, I am mindful of the overwhelmingly positive information produced \nabout Applicant\u2019s current judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness from persons who \nknow about his drug use and have observed him in a variety of personal and professional \ncircumstances, including classified work environments. Despite the adverse information \nabout Applicant, each of his character references recommended him for a position of \ntrust. That information, along with Applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he takes full \nresponsibility for his actions and understands the full scope of the government\u2019s concerns, \npersuades me that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana is not indicative of his current judgment \nand reliability. Applicant no longer associates with anyone who uses illegal drugs, and he \nis in a committed relationship with a girlfriend who does not condone such conduct. I also \nhave evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nBased on the foregoing, I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(c) is applicable here, and that a \nfair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole shows that the \nsecurity concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security \nclearance are mitigated. \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 1.a: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 2.a: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 9, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline I, \npsychological conditions. Applicant responded to the SOR on December 3, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 4, 2019.  \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non April 11, 2019, scheduling the hearing for May 8, 2019. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through K, which \nwere admitted without objection. On May 15, 2019, I proposed to the parties that this \ncase was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Department \nCounsel objected. \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has an \nassociate\u2019s degree and additional college credits. She is married, but separated, with \nthree children.  \n \nApplicant has had minor employment, financial, interpersonal, and legal issues, \nnone of which were significant enough to be a security concern. She went to a new \ndoctor in December 2014, but she did not like how she was treated, and she left shortly \nafter she arrived for her first visit. She filed a complaint against the doctor. The doctor \nwas apparently interviewed for Applicant\u2019s background investigation and provided \nderogatory information, which spurred the DOD to request a psychological evaluation. \n \nApplicant was evaluated at the DOD\u2019s request by a licensed clinical psychologist \non January 24, 2018. The report of the evaluation was completed on February 2, 2018. \nThe psychologist diagnosed Applicant with \u201cHistrionic, borderline, and narcissistic \npersonality traits (Cluster B).\u201d The psychologist wrote that Applicant \u201cdoes not endorse \nor display obvious symptoms of mood disorder at this time . . . . She does display \nobvious signs of a characterological disorder . . . .\u201d The psychologist also wrote: \n \nAmong the problematic issues that can arise in individuals with Cluster B \npersonality traits are lack of empathy, irresponsibility and selfish \nbehaviors, unprovoked aggressive outbursts that can be verbal and/or \nphysical in nature, and many other inappropriate behavior (e.g., behaving \nin provocative or attention seeking ways). \n \nThe psychologist questioned Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and \nopined that \u201c[g]iven the longstanding legal, occupational, and family difficulties in this \ncase, and her lack of insight or interest in treatment, the prognosis for this applicant is \npoor.\u201d \n \nApplicant presented a letter from her treating physician whose medical opinion is \nthat Applicant \u201cis mentally well.\u201d She also presented an evaluation from a licensed \nclinical social worker (LCSW) who found no diagnosis and that Applicant \u201cdoes not \npresent with the \u2018Cluster B\u2019 Personality Disorders, nor does she present with any \nemotional, mental and personality condition that impair[s] her judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant also presented substantial character evidence attesting to \nher excellent job performance, emotional stability, honesty, dedication, loyalty, work \nethic, and integrity. \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n3 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may \nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.  \n \nThe psychologist diagnosed Applicant with \u201cHistrionic, borderline, and narcissistic \npersonality traits (Cluster B),\u201d and reported that problematic issues can arise in \nindividuals with those personality traits. The psychologist also questioned Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nIn order to establish AG \u00b6 28(b), there must be both an opinion that the individual \nhas a condition and that the condition may impair judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. There are some issues with both prongs. I note that Applicant was \nnever diagnosed with a personality disorder; it was the psychologist\u2019s opinion that she \nexhibited certain personality traits. The psychologist presumably utilized the Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which provides: \n \nPersonality traits are enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to, and \nthinking about the environment and oneself that are exhibited in a wide \nrange of social and personal contexts. Only when personality traits are \ninflexible and maladaptive and cause significant functional impairment or \nsubjective distress do they constitute personality disorders. \n \nThere is some question whether personality traits that do not rise to the level of a \npersonality disorder constitute a \u201ccondition.\u201d In that regard, the DSM 5 addresses \nnarcissistic personality traits: \n \n\n \n5 \n \nMany highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be \nconsidered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, \nand persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective \ndistress do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder. \n \nThe DSM similarly warns about histrionic personality traits: \n \nMany individuals may display histrionic personality traits. Only when these \ntraits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant \nfunctional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute histrionic \npersonality disorder. \n \n \nThere is also the question whether those personality traits \u201cimpair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness\u201d (emphasis added), or an individual\u2019s behavior, which may \nreflect poor judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, is utilized to establish that the \nindividual has personality traits. In that regard, it is not completely clear whether the \npsychologist rendered her opinion about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness based on Applicant\u2019s psychological condition or on her behavior. In spite \nof the identified issues, the totality of the evaluation is sufficient to raise concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28(b). \n \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and  \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \nApplicant presented a letter from her treating physician whose medical opinion is \nthat Applicant \u201cis mentally well.\u201d She also presented an evaluation from an LCSW who \nfound no diagnosis and that Applicant \u201cdoes not present with the \u2018Cluster B\u2019 Personality \nDisorders, nor does she present with any emotional, mental and personality condition \nthat impair[s] her judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d Applicant also presented \nsubstantial character evidence. I am satisfied that Applicant possesses the judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness required for a security clearance holder. I conclude that \nany security concerns raised under AG \u00b6 28(b) are mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(d) and \n29(e).   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the psychological conditions security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

She presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the security concern stemming from her delinquent student loans and \ndelinquent consumer debts. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that her \ncircumstances raised security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 2, 2018, and requested a hearing to establish \nher eligibility for continued access to classified information.1 \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here.    \n01/28/2019\n\n2 \n \n \nOn January 15, 2019, a date mutually agreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. \nApplicant testified, and the exhibits offered by the Government were admitted into the \nadministrative record without objection. (Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 5 and Hearing \nExhibits (HE) I and II were admitted without objection.) Applicant offered one exhibit, \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without objection. At the request of \nApplicant, without objection, the record remained open until January 29, 2019. Applicant \ntimely submitted five documents, which I marked as AE B through AE F and which were \nadmitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 23, 2019.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 45 years old, a college graduate, and has been divorced since 2010. \nShe has three adult children. Applicant has been employed by the same defense \ncontractor since October 2011.2  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has six delinquent debts totaling $71,072, of which \ntwo student loans total $62,076.3 Along with her Answer to the SOR, Applicant provided \ndocumentation establishing that two of the SOR debts are under payment plans to which \nshe is adhering, and two of the SOR debts have been paid in full.4  \n \nApplicant testified about the status of her two student loans and explained AE A, \nwhich is a payment history for those loans. Although technically in default, since October \n2005 through January 2019, Applicant has routinely made monthly payments of amounts \nranging from $5 to $6,847. The lender, in its discretion, allocates each payment to either \ninterest-only, principal-only, or some split. Since April 2018, Applicant has only been able \nto address the interest.  She expects soon, however, to have the lender lift the default \nstatus, so her monthly payments can be allocated to retire some of the principal.5  \n \nApplicant testified about the circumstances that caused her indebtedness. In 2009, \nApplicant and her then spouse encountered marital problems, and in 2010 they divorced. \nAt the time, Applicant\u2019s spouse, the father of the three children, was the sole breadwinner, \nApplicant being a full-time mother caring for the children. She was unemployed and was \nthereby deprived of the $80,000 to $90,000 annual earnings her spouse brought to the \nhousehold. After the separation and divorce, Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse provided only \n\u201coccasional\u201d child support. Applicant quickly took part-time jobs, like janitorial work  \ncleaning offices. Because of the children, she could only manage about 20 hours of work \n                                                          \n2 GE 1; Tr. 18, 25.  \n \n3 SOR \u00b6 1.  \n \n4 Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.(c) and (d) (payment plans); Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.(e) and (f) (paid in full). \n \n5 AE A; Tr. 20-22.  \n \n\n3 \n \nper week. After she began her current job in October 2011, however, Applicant \nsucceeded in becoming current with most of her debts.6  \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions are five annual Employee Performance \nEvaluations for Applicant from July 2012 through June 2017. Applicant routinely exceeds \nRating Guidelines and in some categories, she \u201cSignificantly Exceeds\u201d those Guidelines. \nApplicant is described as a \u201cstrong employee,\u201d one with \u201cexcellent problem solving skills\u201d \nwho is \u201cthorough and accurate,\u201d and a \u201cteam player.\u201d7   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to authorize \nsuch access. E.O. 10865 \u00a7 2; SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, \nconsidering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial \ndecision. SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(c), 2(d). \n \nDepartment Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.

Apr. 4, 2014). \nIn resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility, \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(b). See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \n                                                          \n6 Tr. 20, 25-28.

Tr. 24.  \n \n7 AE B through AE F.  \n\n4 \n \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has a number of delinquent debts, which \npurportedly raise a security concern under Guideline F. The financial considerations \nsecurity concern is explained at AG \u00b6 18, which in pertinent part, states: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  \n \n Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial \nissues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality \nto pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to \ndelinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person\u2019s \nself-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.8 \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following pertinent disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n                                                          \n8 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).  \n \n\n5 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection process. Rather, my \nobligation is to examine the way an applicant handles her personal financial obligations \nto assess how she may handle her security obligations.9 Here, Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility was called into question by her delinquent student loans and \ndelinquent consumer debt. I conclude that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a) and (c) \napply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nThe record is clear that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by her divorce \nin 2010. At the time, she became an unemployed (outside of the home) mother of three \nwho suddenly lost all of her household income. What help she got from her ex-spouse \nwas only \u201coccasional,\u201d not much to rely upon in raising a family of four. After a few part-\ntime jobs, in October 2011 Applicant landed the job where she works to this day. She is \na valued employee and has managed to dig herself out of the financial hole that the \ndivorce caused. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (d) apply.  \n \n  \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.10 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion \nto show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      For Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \n \n \n \n    For Applicant \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n9 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016). \n \n10 AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  \n\n6 \n \n  Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to classified information. \n \n  \n____________________ \nPhilip J.

Due to circumstances beyond her control, she suffered from events that \nadversely affected her finances. Resolution of debts through bankruptcy is a legally \nauthorized means for resolving delinquent debt. In October 2018, the bankruptcy court \ndischarged Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. All of \nthe debts alleged in the SOR are now resolved. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.      \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 24, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn June 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nOn July 6, 2018, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and she requested a \nhearing.

On January 25, 2019, \nDOHA received the hearing transcript.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.n, but she also noted that all of these accounts were included in her Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy she filed in July 2018. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. She married in 1995 and divorced in 1999. She married \na second time in 2006 and was divorced in 2010. She has two children, ages 21 and 24 \nyears old. In 1990, she earned an office automation certification, and in 2013, she earned \nan associate\u2019s degree. She has been employed as a project assistant with her federal \ncontractor employer since March 2017. Her annual net (take-home) pay is approximately \n$27,000. She does not currently possess a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 6-7, 11, 20-21, \n24; GE 3)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant attributed her financial complications to a failed business, periods of \nunemployment and underemployment, and unexpected medical issues without medical \ninsurance. In April 2014, Applicant opened a tanning salon business. She purchased the \ntanning equipment and operated the business out of her home. Her business was not \nproducing much income, and Applicant eventually closed the business in May 2016. She \nwas unemployed until November 2016, when she was hired by a temp agency.

This debt resulted from a vehicle \nvoluntarily surrendered by Applicant in 2016. This debt was discharged in Applicant\u2019s \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2018. (Tr. 25-26; GE 5, GE 6; AE A) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a charged-off debt owed to a creditor for $407. Applicant \nobtained a small loan from a \u201cPay Day\u201d type of office with a high interest rate.

(Tr. 27-28; GE 5, GE 6; AE A) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a debt owed to an apartment complex for $958. Applicant was \nunemployed and her grandmother paid her rent for several months. The debt was the \nresult of her leaving one month prior to the lease ending. This debt was discharged in \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2018. (Tr. 29-30; GE 5, GE 6; AE A) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h allege two debts owed to the same creditor for a combined \ntotal of $1,269. Applicant had cable and internet service at two different locations. She \nclosed the cable contract early, but tried to maintain her internet service for employment \nsearches. She claimed to have turned-in her cable equipment, but believes some of the \ndelinquent amount is for improper equipment charges. These debts were discharged in \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2018. (Tr. 30-32, 34-36) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a debt placed for collection for $648. This is for unpaid college \ntuition while Applicant was attending school to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. She attempted \nto set-up monthly payment arrangements, but the creditor wanted the account paid in full. \nThis debt was discharged in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2018. (Tr. 33; \nGE 5, GE 6; AE A)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.m allege unpaid medical accounts in the total amount \nof $16,571. Applicant experienced medical issues during a period of time she did not have \nmedical insurance. In 2014, she was diagnosed with walking pneumonia, which she had \nfor nearly three months. In 2016, she was hospitalized for a few days with acute pelvic \ninflammation. She filled out a form with the hospital to have her medical debts reduced, \nor possibly eliminated, due to her low income, but she was denied. Applicant has medical \ninsurance with her current employer. These debts were discharged in Applicant\u2019s Chapter \n7 bankruptcy in October 2018. (Tr. 36-40, 43-45, 68; GE 1, GE 5, GE 6; AE A) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a debt owed to a landlord in the amount of $2,860. Applicant \nstayed at her friend\u2019s home, but she was unable to pay full rent. Applicant set-up a \nmonthly repayment plan with her friend and continued to pay until her bankruptcy attorney \nadvised her to stop. This debt was discharged in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nOctober 2018. (Tr. 41-43; GE 1, GE 6; AE A) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n alleges a debt placed for collection in the amount of $618. Applicant \nreceived another \u201cPay Day\u201d loan, which she was unable to pay. This debt was discharged \nin Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2018. (Tr. 46; GE 4, GE 6; AE A) \n \nApplicant was required to take financial counseling after she filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy protection. She learned from counseling that she needed to reduce her \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nspending habits, which she has implemented in her current budget. She also intends to \ngo back to college next semester in an effort to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. Her employer \noffers tuition reimbursement. She currently has outstanding student loans totaling \napproximately $65,000. The student loans will go into deferment while she is enrolled in \ncollege. It is her intention to repay all of her student loans. She has filed all Federal and \nstate income tax returns. (Tr. 55- 60, 64)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \n  \nThe SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling $28,559. The record establishes the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \n  \nFour financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago,2 was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts resulted from her failed business, periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment, and from serious medical issues that required medical treatment when \nshe did carry medical insurance. These circumstances are largely beyond her control. \nHer bankruptcy attorney recommended that she seek a fresh financial start through \nbankruptcy. Resolution of debts through bankruptcy is a legally authorized means for \nresolving delinquent debt. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court website states: \n \nA fundamental goal of the federal bankruptcy laws enacted by Congress is \nto give debtors a financial \u201cfresh start\u201d from burdensome debts. The \nSupreme Court made this point about the purpose of the bankruptcy law in \na 1934 decision: \u201c[I]t gives to the honest but unfortunate debtor \u2026 a new \nopportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the \npressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.\u201d Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 U.S. 234, 244 (1934). This goal is accomplished through the bankruptcy \ndischarge, which releases debtors from personal liability from specific debts \nand prohibits creditors from ever taking any action against the debtor to \ncollect those debts.  \n \n                                            \n2 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nOn October 25, 2018, the bankruptcy court discharged Applicant\u2019s nonpriority \nunsecured debts under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. As part of the bankruptcy \nprocess, she received financial counseling and generated a new budget. Applicant has \nresolved all of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Although not cited in the SOR, \nApplicant intends to pay her outstanding student loans. She plans to enroll in college next \nsemester, which will put her student loans in deferment status. (AE A)   \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s accounts alleged in the SOR are resolved and there are clear \nindications that her finances are under control. Now that she has a fresh start, future \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) are established, \nand financial considerations security concerns are mitigated.   \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old project assistant employed by a government contractor \nfor over two years now. She intends to continue her college education until she earns a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant\u2019s failed business in 2016, medical issues while not carrying \nmedical insurance, and periods of unemployment and underemployment are \ncircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control that adversely affected her finances. On \nOctober 25, 2018, the bankruptcy court discharged all of her delinquent nonpriority \nunsecured debts under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  \n  \nResolution of debts through bankruptcy is a legally authorized means for resolving \ndelinquent debt. Applicant\u2019s actions show financial responsibility and good judgment and \nshe has established her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Future financial problems are unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated.    \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________________ \nPamela C.

He has lived for many years in \nState 2, a neighboring state. (Tr. 112-113) \n \nAs to federal tax issues, Applicant disclosed on his September 2015 SCA that he \n\u201cfailed to file and pay federal income taxes during the years 2007, 2008, and 2009. I \nmade payments and loss [sic] income returns.\u201d He estimated that he had failed to pay \nabout $5,000 in federal income taxes. He also stated that the debt had been satisfied in \nabout May 2012. (GE 1 at 29) \n \n \nAs to state tax issues, Applicant stated on his SCA, \u201cI do not know why I failed to \nfile/pay for the years listed 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\u201d He \nestimated that he had failed to pay about $15,000 in state income taxes, and said he \nwas \u201cstill making payments for the unpaid taxes.\u201d (GE 1 at 30) \n \n \nApplicant had background interviews on January 23 and 26, 2018. He \nauthenticated the interviewing agent\u2019s summaries of those interviews in an Interrogatory \nResponse to DOHA in July 2018. (GE 2) Those interview summaries do not address the \nissue of Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state and federal income tax returns. Applicant \nalso had an earlier interview, in July 2017, but the summary of that earlier interview is \nnot in evidence. (GE 2 at 6) \n \n \nApplicant stated in his January 23, 2018 interview summary that $300 of his \nmonthly pay had been garnished to resolve his federal income tax debt. The start date \nis not noted, but the garnishment ended in May 2012, when the IRS notified him that his \nfederal income tax debt was satisfied. (GE 2 at 6) This evidence provided the basis for \nthe Government\u2019s withdrawal of SOR \u00b6 1.b (which Applicant also denied in his Answer). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s State 2 tax debt was initially being paid through a wage garnishment, \nwhich began in 2015. (GE 3; Tr. 91, 98-100) In November 2017, the garnishment was \nremoved when Applicant contacted State 2 tax authorities and arranged to pay $382 a \nmonth through his bank account to resolve his past-due state income tax debt, \nestimated at about $15,000, for tax years 2007-2014.4 (Tr. 100, 114-115; GE 2 at 6, 7; \nGE 3; AE A) He began those voluntary payments in January 2018. (Tr. 49) \n \n \nA \u201cStatement of Account\u201d from State 2\u2019s Department of Revenue shows that as \nof July 2018, Applicant owed $8,465 in State 2 taxes, penalties, and interest, for tax \nyears 2013 and 2014. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) He had paid $2,934 towards his tax debt during \n2018. The July 2018 \u201cStatement of Account\u201d does not reference any earlier tax years. \n(GE 4)  \n \n                                                          \n4 This $15,000 figure was erroneously alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b as what Applicant owed in past-due federal \ntax debt. He disclosed on his SCA that he owed $5,000 in federal taxes, not $15,000, and in any event, \nSOR \u00b6 1.b was withdrawn, since that debt was paid in 2012.  \n \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA \nExemption 6 applies                                                 \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a November 2018 bank statement showing that he continues \nto have $382 withdrawn each month towards his State 2 tax debt. (AE A) He did not \nprovide documentation from State 2 of an updated balance, but said he had paid an \nadditional $1,000 or $1,200 since July 2018, and had about $7,000 left to pay. (Tr. 50, \n62, 70, 98)  \n \n \nAs amended, the SOR alleges that for tax years 2007 to 2014, Applicant failed to \ntimely file his federal income tax returns (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and state income tax returns (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d), as required. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he filed his state and federal tax returns for tax years \n2007, 2008, and 2009, \u201call three at the same time,\u201d in 2010. (Tr. 52, 55-57, 64, 82, 86) \nWhen asked why he filed his returns late, Applicant said he was told by an informal tax \nadvisor that \u201cif I didn\u2019t owe taxes I could file three years together.\u201d He also said he heard \nthe person who told him this was later indicted. (Tr. 56) (Tr. 82-83) If Applicant filed all \nthree of these returns in April 2010, as he said, this would make his 2009 returns timely, \nbut his 2007 and 2008 returns late. (Tr. 59, 84) \n \n \nWhile the record is rather unclear on this point, Applicant also testified that, either \nfor those years (2007-2009), or perhaps for some years after that (2010-2013), his \nfianc\u00e9e attempted to file their tax returns on their home computer, through a nationally \nrecognized tax preparation software program. (Tr. 51, 52, 55, 68) This \u201cdidn\u2019t work out \naltogether correct either. So that just put me deeper in the hole,\u201d he testified. (Tr. 52) It \nis unclear if this refers to calculation of taxes owed, or to tax filings as well.  \n \n \nApplicant also asserted that, since he worked in State 1, his employer had not \nbeen withholding state taxes for State 2, where he lives. (Tr. 52) He asserted that he \nwas supposed to file state income tax returns both for State 2, where he lives, and a \n\u201cnon-resident\u201d tax return for State 1, where he works. (Tr. 52-54, 88, 113)5 He also \nattempted to claim his commuting expenses, because he has an interstate commute to \nand from work every day. This was not successful, and he had to pay a penalty when \nhe filed his three years of returns, in 2010. (Tr. 56-57) \n \n \nFor tax years 2014 through 2016, Applicant hired a tax preparation firm from \nCalifornia (not Applicant\u2019s home state) who he heard about on the radio. He paid them \n$5,000. He said they assisted in preparing and filing his federal returns for those years, \nbut not his State 2 returns. By the time of his background interviews (2017 and 2018), \nhe decided to contact State 2 himself to resolve his state tax issues (as discussed \nabove). (Tr. 59-62, 69, 71, 84-94)  \n \n                                                          \n5 There is no allegation in the SOR about overdue State 1 taxes or tax returns, nor is there any such \nindication in the record. He also has never lived there.     \n \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA \nExemption 6 applies                                                 \n5 \n \n \nIn his Answer to SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant admitted that he \u201cfailed to timely file as \nrequired federal income tax returns for the tax years 2007, 2008, and 2009.\u201d (Answer) \nThis comports with what he disclosed on his SCA. (GE 1 at 29) He did not address tax \nyears 2010 to 2014 in his Answer. At the start of the hearing, when this was brought to \nhis attention, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a in full, as to all federal tax years alleged. \n(2007-2014) (Tr. 16, 51)  \n \nLater in the hearing, however, when asked about the status of his filings for tax \nyears 2010-2014, Applicant testified, \u201c[w]ell, I didn\u2019t file on time for [State 2]. As far as \nmy federal taxes, I thought that I filed every one [of those years] on time, I honestly did.\u201d \n(Tr. 63; see also Tr. 64) Applicant also said he thought he filed all of those federal \nreturns on time \u201cexcept for maybe one\u201d year, tax year 2014. (Tr. 65) \n \nApplicant acknowledged at hearing, both in answering SOR \u00b6 1.d, and later, that \nhe filed his State 2 tax returns late, for tax years 2007 through 2014. (Tr. 21, 63, 66, 88, \n91) This admission also comports with what he disclosed on his SCA. (GE 1 at 30) He \ndid not file an extension to the annual filing deadline. (Tr. 88) \n \n \nApplicant testified that as of the date of the hearing, he had no federal or State 2 \ntax returns that remained unfiled, including tax years not alleged (2015, 2016, and \n2017). He stated that since 2014, his federal and State 2 tax returns had been filed on \ntime. (Tr. 66-67) He also testified that he owed no past-due federal taxes, and no past-\ndue State 2 income taxes beyond the $7,000 he still owes for tax years 2013 and 2014. \n(Tr. 69) \n \n \nWith his July 2018 Interrogatory Response to DOHA, Applicant provided copies \nof account transcripts from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2015-2017, \nbut not for any earlier tax year. He said he was only able to request those three years \nby phone, and would have had to make a written request to the IRS for earlier account \ntranscripts. He did not do that. (Tr. 116) \n \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2015 federal tax return in November 2016 (though it was \nseveral months late). He filed his 2016 and 2017 federal tax returns on time. (GE 2)6 GE \n2, then, largely supports Applicant\u2019s testimony as to his more recent federal tax filings. \nHe was not asked to provide State 2 tax transcripts with the Interrogatory Response. \n \n \n \nApplicant recently began working with a nationally recognized tax preparation \nservice. With their assistance, he filed his 2017 state and federal tax returns on time. \n(Tr. 67-68, 86; GE 2) His plan is to use them for his 2018 taxes, and in the future. (Tr. \n108) \n                                                          \n6 Applicant submitted federal tax transcripts for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 when he responded to \nDOHA\u2019s Interrogatory. Those returns were not initially submitted as part of GE 2, but were offered by \nDepartment Counsel during the hearing when they came up during Applicant\u2019s cross-examination. They \nwere then included as part of GE 2, and admitted without objection. (Tr. 71-81) \n \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA \nExemption 6 applies                                                 \n6 \n \n \n \nIn 2015, Applicant earned about $69,000 in adjusted gross income; in 2016, he \nearned just under $71,000 in adjusted gross income; and in 2017, he earned over \n$116,000 in adjusted gross income. (GE 2) He attributed this significant increase to an \nextended work assignment in another state when he worked a lot of overtime. His \ncurrent income level is between $60,000 and $64,000 annually, before overtime, and \nabout $80,000 including overtime. During summer 2018, Applicant was sidelined for \nseveral months with an injury, so he earned significantly less income than usual. (Tr. \n101-104) \n \n \nApplicant and his fianc\u00e9e live in a home that she owns. He makes the $520 \nmonthly house payment. He has a $407 monthly car payment. His daughter is in \ncollege, and he helps her financially when he can. With his other monthly expenses, he \nhas limited funds left over at the end of the month and essentially lives paycheck-to-\npaycheck. He has about $70,000 in his 401k plan, and borrowed about $3,000 against it \nfor his recent medical expenses. His fianc\u00e9e is on disability, and does not work. They try \nto keep to a budget but he has not had formal credit counseling. (Tr. 94, 103-108, 111, \n117) \n \n \nApplicant loves his country, his job, his children, and his family. He spoke with \nappreciation of the mentoring he received from older employees when his career began \n28 years ago, and seeks to be a mentor now for younger employees himself. He takes \ngreat pride in the work he does for his country. He understands the need to \u201cdot every \u2018i\u2019 \nand cross every \u2018t\u2019\u201d both at work and otherwise, and he recognizes that he did not do \nthat with his taxes. He is sorry for his actions and recognizes that it was \u201csomething I \nbrought on myself. But I\u2019m trying to work through it.\u201d (Tr. 27-29, 70, 127-128) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d7 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n                                                          \n7 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA \nExemption 6 applies                                                 \n7 \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe financial considerations security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA \nExemption 6 applies                                                 \n8 \n \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  \n \nApplicant disclosed on his September 2015 SCA that he had failed to file several \nyears of federal income tax returns (2007-2009) and State 2 income tax returns (2007-\n2014) on time, as required. He disclosed about $5,000 in past-due federal income taxes \nand about $15,000 in past-due state income taxes.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, concerning past-due State 2 income tax debt, is established by the \nrecord evidence, and the above disqualifying conditions all apply. SOR \u00b6 1.b, \nconcerning federal tax debt, was withdrawn. \n \nThe record as to the status of Applicant\u2019s late-filed federal and State 2 income \ntax returns is less clear. This is, in part, because Applicant\u2019s testimony was at times \nconfusing as to who he relied on for tax advice for certain tax years, and because his \ntestimony was uncorroborated by clarifying documentation.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems began, at least in part, because he initially relied on \nincorrect advice from an informal tax advisor who told him he could file his tax returns \nthree years late if he was due a refund. Applicant also sought deductions to which he \nwas not entitled (his interstate commuting expenses) and had to pay a penalty when he \nfiled those returns.  \n \nRegardless of the reason, Applicant testified consistently that he filed his 2007, \n2008, and 2009 state and federal income tax returns in April 2010. That testimony also \ncomports with what he disclosed on his SCA and, as to his federal returns, what he \nadmitted in his Answer. I therefore conclude that Applicant filed his 2007 and 2008 state \nand federal tax returns late, but find that his 2009 tax returns were timely. AG \u00b6 19(f) is \nestablished as to Applicant\u2019s 2007 and 2008 federal returns. (SOR \u00b6 1.a, in part) \n \nApplicant also disclosed on his SCA, with specific, year-by-year details, that he \nfailed to file his State 2 income tax returns for 2007-2014. His testimony also comported \nwith that evidence (but for 2009, as noted above). The Government added SOR \u00b6 1.d at \nthe start of the hearing on the basis of the SCA. Applicant did not object to the \namendment, though he unquestionably had a right to do so, given its lateness. He was \ngiven seven weeks after the hearing to provide relevant documentation, but did not do \nso. Nonetheless, AG \u00b6 19(f) is established as to SOR \u00b6 1.d, given his admission and his \ntestimony.  \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA \nExemption 6 applies                                                 \n9 \n \n \nThis leaves Applicant\u2019s federal returns for tax years 2010-2014, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. As noted, Applicant did not disclose those federal returns as having been \nfiled late on his SCA. He did not address those returns in answering SOR \u00b6 1.a in his \nSOR response, confining his answer to tax years 2007-2009.  \n \nAt the start of the hearing, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a in full. However, his \ntestimony did not support that admission, as he then said several times that he thought \nhe had filed his federal returns on time, but for 2014. However, it was not until 2014 that \nhe retained the tax advisor from California who began to address his federal returns, \nand it was through their assistance that Applicant later began to file his returns in a \ntimely manner. Applicant\u2019s testimony is also not supported by documentation that might \nhave clarified the matter. I also cannot ignore his unqualified admission to SOR \u00b6 1.a in \nfull, at the start of the hearing. AG \u00b6 19(f) therefore applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a (but for his \n2009 returns, which I conclude were timely filed, as noted above).  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his state and federal income tax returns from 2007 \nto 2014. He disclosed late-filed income tax returns and related tax debt on his 2015 \nSCA. He testified that he pursued tax assistance, from a variety of sources, with varying \nsuccess, for several years. His first tax advisor gave him bad advice, which was that he \ncould file his returns three years late if he was due a refund. He cured that in 2010 by \nfiling earlier returns. That led to the federal tax debt, which took until 2012 to resolve. He \nand his fianc\u00e9e then used a nationally recognized computer program to prepare and file \ntheir returns themselves, but evidently made errors, either as to calculation of taxes \nowed, or as to filing, which put him \u201cdeeper in the hole,\u201d as he testified. Applicant then \nhired the tax firm from California in 2014, and they resolved his federal tax returns but \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA \nExemption 6 applies                                                 \n10 \n \n \nnot his state returns. He pursued resolution of those himself and has been making \nregular payments on that debt. Applicant is now using a nationally recognized, reputable \ntax preparer and will continue to do so in the future. His issues with late filing tax returns \nare now in the past. \n \n \nThe document from Applicant\u2019s state tax authority (GE 4) lists debt from tax \nyears 2013 and 2014. I therefore conclude that those returns have been filed and that \nthe past-due taxes Applicant owed were then duly calculated by authorities. GE 4 does \nnot reference any outstanding tax owed, or any unfiled return, from any earlier year. I \ntherefore infer from GE 4 that no earlier (or later) state returns are outstanding. \nApplicant\u2019s past-due state tax debt is nonetheless ongoing, so AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully \napply. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) apply to mitigate SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also credit Applicant\u2019s long employment \nrecord in the defense industry. He has mitigated the financial security concerns. In \nreaching this conclusion, I considered not only Applicant\u2019s credibility, but the record \nevidence as a whole. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA \nExemption 6 applies                                                 \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:   \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:   \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 40 years old. She has worked for a defense contractor since November 2016. Previously, she worked for federal contractors from August 2015 to March 2016 and from 2005 to May 2014. She experienced periods of unemployment from March 2016 to November 2016 and from May 2014 to August 2015. She is single, never married, and has no children. The record is silent concerning her education level.1 The SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her 2012 through 2016 federal tax returns and her 2013 through 2015 state tax returns. It also alleged she owed approximately $7,950 for unpaid federal taxes for years 2012 through 2014. Finally, the SOR alleged Applicant owed an unpaid medical debt in the amount of $250. Applicant admitted in her February 2016 security clearance application (SCA) and her statement to a defense investigator in May 2017 that she failed to file her 2012 through 2016 federal returns. She admitted in her SCA that she failed to file her 2013 through 2015 state returns. She also admitted owing back federal taxes. Credit reports document the delinquent medical debt.2 Applicant explained that she began experiencing financial difficulties in 2012 when her roommate lost her job and Applicant had to cover her roommate\u2019s share of the rent.

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective \nJune 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 3, 2018, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 8, 2018. The evidence \n  12/07/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 5-9 (Items 1-4 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on August \n16, 2018. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not file objections, but she submitted \nexhibits (AE) A-C. AE A-C and Items 5-9 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on November 2, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admissions are adopted as \nfindings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. She has worked for a defense contractor since \nNovember 2016. Previously, she worked for federal contractors from August 2015 to \nMarch 2016 and from 2005 to May 2014. She experienced periods of unemployment \nfrom March 2016 to November 2016 and from May 2014 to August 2015. She is single, \nnever married, and has no children. The record is silent concerning her education level.1  \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her 2012 through 2016 federal \ntax returns and her 2013 through 2015 state tax returns. It also alleged she owed \napproximately $7,950 for unpaid federal taxes for years 2012 through 2014. Finally, the \nSOR alleged Applicant owed an unpaid medical debt in the amount of $250. Applicant \nadmitted in her February 2016 security clearance application (SCA) and her statement \nto a defense investigator in May 2017 that she failed to file her 2012 through 2016 \nfederal returns. She admitted in her SCA that she failed to file her 2013 through 2015 \nstate returns. She also admitted owing back federal taxes. Credit reports document the \ndelinquent medical debt.2 \n \n \nApplicant explained that she began experiencing financial difficulties in 2012 \nwhen her roommate lost her job and Applicant had to cover her roommate\u2019s share of the \nrent. Her difficulties were exasperated when she experienced periods of unemployment \nat various times in 2014, 2015, and 2016. She did not file her tax returns or pay the tax \nowed because she did not have the money to do so.3  \n \n \nWhen she was interviewed by a defense investigator in November 2017, she \nindicated she was working with an accountant to get her tax returns filed. She provided \ndocumentation showing that she filed her 2012 through 2015 federal returns in May \n2018. She also provided documentation that her 2016 federal return was prepared, but \nshe failed to provide proof that it was filed. Applicant provided documentation showing \n                                                          \n1 Items 5, 9. \n \n2 Items 4, 9. \n \n3 Item 9; AE A. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthat in August 2018, the IRS accepted an installment payment plan from her whereby \n$140 monthly will be withdrawn from her bank account to pay the taxes, penalty and \ninterest that she owes. Applicant failed to produce evidence that any payments have \nbeen made to the IRS under the plan. She also failed to produce documentation \naddressing the filing of her 2013 through 2015 state tax returns. Applicant\u2019s tax issues \nremain unresolved.4 \n \n \nApplicant claims the medical debt is resolved and is awaiting paperwork to verify \nthe debt is paid. She failed to provide any documentation disputing this debt or showing \nresolution by payment. This debt remains unresolved.5 \n \n \nApplicant provided some budget information when she answered the \nGovernment\u2019s interrogatories in May 2018. According to that information, she is left with \napproximately $750 at the end of the month after paying all her expenses (this includes \npaying her $140 monthly tax installment payment). There is no evidence of financial \ncounseling.6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \n                                                          \n4 AE A-B. \n \n5 AE A-C. \n \n6 Item 6. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has delinquent federal tax debt that remains unpaid or unresolved \nbecause of her inability to pay it. She also failed to timely file her 2012 through 2016 \nfederal returns and her 2013 through 2015 state returns as required. She has a \ndelinquent medical debt that remains unresolved. I find all the above listed disqualifying \nconditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant failed to show sufficient efforts toward resolving her federal and state \ntax issues. Although it appears she filed her 2012 through 2015 federal returns in May \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2018, shortly before the issuance of her SOR, and entered into a payment agreement \nwith the IRS in August 2018, she failed to show that she made payments under the plan \nor that she has addressed her unfiled state returns for 2013 through 2015. Her inaction \nshows a lack of reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s periods of unemployment qualify as a condition beyond her control, \nhowever, she failed to show responsible action in addressing her federal and state tax \nissues as well as a delinquent medical debt. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. There was no evidence of \nfinancial counseling. She receives some credit for establishing a payment plan with the \nIRS, even though there is no proof that payments have started. However, since it took \nher almost two years to contact the IRS and negotiate this plan, and because her state \ntax issues are unaddressed, good-faith efforts to pay or resolve her tax issues are \nlacking. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and AG \u00b6 20(g) partially apply. She failed to provide \ndocumentation supporting her dispute of SOR debt \u00b6 1.f. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered her periods of \nunemployment and her agreement with the IRS, but I also considered her lack of \nprogress in resolving her tax debt and filing her tax returns. Applicant has not \nestablished a track record of financial stability.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance because of her financial \n\n \n7 \n \n \nstatus. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 13, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol \nconsumption), H (drug involvement and substance misuse), and E (personal conduct). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 10, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 1, 2018. \n\n \n2 \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing (NOH) \non November 29, 2018, scheduling the hearing for January 16, 2019. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. \n \nWithout objection, the Government amended the SOR pursuant to E3.1.17 of the \nDirective, to replace \u201c2006\u201d with \u201c2009\u201d in SOR 3.b; delete \u201cand that you misused the \nprescription medication Oxycodone in December 2015\u201d in SOR 3.d and 3.i; and delete \n\u201cand Oxycodone\u201d in SOR 3.e and 3.h. I marked the Government\u2019s discovery letter and \nlist of exhibits as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II, and Applicant\u2019s list of exhibits as HE III. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1, 3, and 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. (Tr. \nat 7-8, 15-20).  \n \nApplicant objected to portions of GE 2 consisting of Another Government \nAgency\u2019s (AGA) clearance decision statement, two reports of polygraph examination, \nand a final outcome of appeal. He argued that these four documents were \nunauthenticated and he did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the individuals \nwho made the adverse statements against him. I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection and \nadmitted GE 2 in evidence. Applicant testified, called four witnesses, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. The record closed at the conclusion of the hearing. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on January 28, 2019. (Tr. at 7-8, 15-20, 205, 231).  \n                                                                                                                                                        \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a and 3.b. He denied the \nremaining SOR allegations. Applicant is 63 years old. He married in 1978, divorced in \n2006, remarried in 2010, and divorced in 2012. He has three adult children. Two serve \nin the U.S. military and the third is a state trooper. (Response to the SOR; Tr. at 8, 49-\n51, 57, 63, 67, 83-85, 158-160; GE 1, 2, 3, 4).   \n \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the U.S. Military Academy at West \nPoint (West Point) in 1978 and two master\u2019s degrees, in 1985 and 1991. He was \ncommissioned as an infantry officer and served in the U.S. Army from 1978 to 1985, \nwhen he was honorably discharged. He has since worked for various DOD contractors. \nAs of the date of the hearing, he worked as a consultant for a DOD contractor since \nOctober 2018. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 1974. (Tr. at 5-6, 51-\n57, 158-160; GE 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A). \n \n \nIn 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence \n(DUI) (SOR 1.a, 3.a). This was his first and only alcohol-related incident. He was \nseparated from his first wife. He was at a restaurant with coworkers and he consumed \nsix 12- to 16-ounce beers over the course of approximately four hours. He felt \nintoxicated. He wrecked his car as he drove home, after overcorrecting in an effort to \navoid a deer. The police took him into custody and cited him for DUI. He was sentenced \nto probation before judgment; his driver\u2019s license was suspended for approximately 90 \ndays; he was fined; and he was ordered to make a donation to Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving. (Tr. at 62-66; GE 2, 3; AE D).  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant has not had any subsequent alcohol-related arrests or charges. He \ndenied consuming alcohol to the point of intoxication and driving under the influence of \nalcohol and while intoxicated on numerous occasions between 2005 and 2015 (SOR \n1.b, 1.c, 3.a). He denied the following information reflected in a May 2015 report of \npolygraph examination that: (1) he stopped consuming alcohol after his 2010 heart \nattack; (2) from November 2013 to November 2014, he consumed four vodka tonics, \ntotaling one pint of vodka, over the course of an evening four to five nights weekly, and \nhe drank until he felt intoxicated and then fell asleep three to four nights weekly; (3) he \nhad most recently operated a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in February 2014, \nafter attending a poker game with friends and consuming three to four two-ounce shots \nof bourbon over a four-hour period, and he would have likely been cited with DUI if he \nhad been stopped by police on this occasion; (4) his girlfriend in November 2014 \nexpressed concern about the amount of his alcohol consumption; and (5) in his lifetime, \nhe had driven \u201ca few dozen times\u201d while feeling intoxicated but was undetected. (Tr. at \n66-70, 112-124, 160; GE 2; AE D). \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was either misinterpreted or he misspoke in May 2015. \nHe testified that he continued to consume red wine in moderation after his heart attack. \nHe acknowledged potentially consuming a pint of vodka over the course of a week from \nNovember 2013 to November 2014; he could not explain how he may have misspoken \nabout drinking until he felt intoxicated then falling asleep three to four nights weekly \nduring that period. He testified that his reference to the February 2014 occurrence was \nto a friend in the poker group who had consumed bourbon and \u201cwas slurring his words\u201d \nwhen the friend telephoned him to notify him of a roadside sobriety checkpoint. He \ntestified that he meant to state that he typically consumed a few drinks of red wine over \nthe course of approximately six hours at periodic poker games with friends. He testified \nthat his girlfriend did not express concern over the amount of his alcohol consumption in \nNovember 2014. (Tr. at 66-70, 112-124, 160; GE 2; AE D). \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that as a single man, from approximately 2006 to 2010 \nand since 2012, he has belonged to a social activities group for adults whose principal \nevent consisted of weekly beach volleyball, where he would consume a beer or two \nover the course of a three- to four-hour evening game before driving home. From \nJanuary to June 2015, he testified that he consumed around three to four vodka tonics \nor red wine nightly to treat his hip pain, as further discussed below, but he did not \nconsider himself intoxicated on these occasions. Since his hip surgery in June 2015, he \ntestified that he consumes two drinks a night, two nights a week. From mid-2015 to \nFebruary 2017, he testified that he consumed a drink or two socially with friends. He \ntestified that he was careful not to consume alcohol when he took Oxycodone, as \nfurther discussed below, because doing so \u201cis an instant prescription for falling asleep\u201d \nand \u201cyou\u2019re a danger to everybody\u201d if you drink, take Oxycodone, and drive. (Tr. at 66-\n70, 112-124, 135-140, 160; GE 2; AE D). \n \n \nApplicant denied that he knowingly circumvented appropriate methods to obtain \nhis prescription heart medication, Crestor, twice--in 2013 and in 2014 (SOR 3.c). \nThough he had health insurance, his deductible was $700, which he could not afford on \nhis limited income as a consultant at the time. He testified that he informed his doctor of \n\n \n4 \n \nsuch to no avail. He testified that he discussed his situation with his sister and she \noffered to send him her Crestor pills. On both occasions, she sent him a 30-day supply. \nHe believed she had a prescription for Crestor, but he could not recall whether she, in \nfact, did or if she obtained a prescription for him. He testified that she paid a nominal \namount, sent him her medication, and he sent her a check for $65 to $75. He testified \nthat he did not think it was a big deal at the time. He does not anticipate this becoming a \nproblem in the future since the generic Crestor is now more affordable and he would be \neligible to qualify for Medicare. He also testified that he would utilize other \nmethodologies, such as declare himself indigent, go to the emergency room, or obtain \ndoctor samples, if necessary. He signed a statement of intent to not use any illegal \nsubstance or abuse prescription drugs in the future, and that violation would result in the \nrevocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 85-90, 143-147, 174-175; GE 2; AE E).  \n \n \nApplicant denied using marijuana in December 2014, and he denied that this \nalleged use of marijuana occurred after he was granted a security clearance in \nSeptember 2005 (SOR 2.a, 2.d, 3.a). A December 2015 report of polygraph \nexamination reflects: \n \nDuring pretest interview, [Applicant] reported that in December 2014, while \ntailgating at the Army vs. Navy football game at M&T Bank Stadium in \nBaltimore, MD, [Applicant] smoked marijuana. [Applicant] took a \u201chit\u201d off of \na marijuana joint that [Applicant\u2019s] friend passed around. [Applicant] did \nnot purchase the marijuana or contribute money towards the purchase of \nthe marijuana. [Applicant] was aware of the policy regarding no illegal drug \ninvolvement while holding a security clearance, but at the time, [Applicant] \nthought \u201cwhy not?\u201d [Applicant] initially did not report this incident during his \nprevious polygraph on 06 May 2015 because he was embarrassed and \nbelieved it was a one[-]time event. \n \nApplicant denied that the marijuana was passed around, testifying that it was just \npassed to him from his friend. He testified that he could not recall using the word \u201chit,\u201d \nbut stated \u201cI think I used the word drag. . . .\u201d (Tr. at 70-73, 81-83, 109-110, 125-132, \n147-155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D). \n \n \nApplicant also denied saying that he did not report his December 2014 marijuana \nuse during his May 2015 interview with the AGA (SOR 3.f) due to \u201cembarrassment.\u201d He \ntestified, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that because I\u2019m sure it came up . . . .\u201d Rather, he testified that \nhe did not disclose it in May 2015 because he did not consider it a \u201cuse\u201d of marijuana, \nand he chose to volunteer the incident in December 2015. He continued: \n \nCertainly not because of any embarrassment, although I will freely admit \nthat it was not my finest hour. But I do believe that it was, in fact, a one-\ntime event \u2013 and it was actually a one-time non-event.    \n \nHe denied saying that he chose to disregard the policy against illegal drug use while \nholding a clearance. He testified, \u201cI would never say something like \u2018why not.\u2019 That\u2019s just \n\n \n5 \n \nnot in my DNA to even respond to him.\u201d (Tr. at 70-73, 81-83, 109-110, 125-132, 147-\n155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D). \n \n \nApplicant described the December 2014 marijuana incident as follows: he and a \ngroup of 40 other individuals, to include some of his West Point classmates, took a \nthree- to four-hour bus ride to a football game. His hips \u201cstiffened up quite dramatically\u201d \nduring the ride, but they were not \u201chorrible, they were just stiff and very uncomfortable.\u201d \nWhile tailgating, his friend, who had a medical marijuana card, offered him marijuana to \nprovide relief for his hips. He \u201cstupidly . . . went to try it\u201d and concurrently with doing so, \nthought it was a bad idea. He testified: \n \nI pulled the smoke into my mouth and . . . it was just so incredibly \ndisgusting that I spit it out and had to rinse my mouth out, it was absolutely \noff-the-chart disgusting . . . . \n \nHe acknowledged that he took a \u201cpuff\u201d of the marijuana cigarette, but insisted that he \ndid not inhale or ingest it, he did not experience any effect from it, and he did not believe \nit rose to the level of \u201cuse.\u201d He testified that he \u201cran up to the line and leaned over it, \nperhaps, but . . . I do not think I crossed that line.\u201d He signed a statement of intent to not \nuse any illegal substance or abuse prescription drugs in the future, and that violation \nwould result in the revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 70-73, 81-83, 109-110, 125-132, \n147-155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D, E). \n \n \nApplicant denied misusing the prescription medication Xanax in February 2015. \nHe also denied misusing the prescription medication Xanax after he was granted a \nsecurity clearance in September 2005 (SOR 2.b, 2.d, 3.a). He testified that he went \nthrough a \u201cmanic depressive\u201d period during the military deployments of two of his \nchildren, the first deployment of which occurred in 2004. He described himself as: \n \nI couldn\u2019t relax. I . . . would stand up and then just start pacing. And, or I \nwas just like, I wouldn\u2019t say lethargic, but . . . I found just found it hard to \ncare about things. . . . I was crazed. . . . I was freaked out. \n \nHe testified that in February 2015, his then live-in girlfriend suggested that he take one \nof her prescription Xanax. He testified that he used one quarter of one pill. Within three \nor four days, he testified that he had an appointment with his primary care physician, \nwho prescribed him Xanax. Though he felt the angst related to his children\u2019s \ndeployments for a number of years prior to 2015, he had not previously been prescribed \nXanax. He used his prescribed Xanax for approximately three weeks and \u201cit settled me.\u201d \n(Tr. at 51, 73-77, 79-83, 110-111, 132-135, 147-155, 162-171; GE 2; AE D). \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not believe he misused his then girlfriend\u2019s Xanax \nbecause he \u201cused it in the manner that it was supposed to be used,\u201d and he obtained a \nprescription of his own shortly after. He testified that it did not occur to him that such use \nwas illegal, though in hindsight he saw that it was. He testified that in the future, he \nwould go to the emergency room rather than use another individual\u2019s prescription. He \nsigned a statement of intent to not use any illegal substance or abuse prescription drugs \n\n \n6 \n \nin the future, and that violation would result in the revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 51, \n73-77, 79-83, 110-111, 132-135, 147-155, 162-171; AE E). \n \n \nApplicant denied misusing the prescription medication Oxycodone in December \n2015. He also denied misusing the prescription medication Oxycodone after he was \ngranted a security clearance in September 2005 (SOR 2.c, 2.d, 3.a). He cited to a \nseries of health problems that started when he experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in \nJune 2010. In December 2010, he then had a quintuple bypass surgery, and his \nrecovery period lasted for approximately one year. In January 2015, he was diagnosed \nwith degenerative problems in both of his hips, requiring bilateral hip replacement \nsurgery. He underwent the first of two surgeries in June 2015, and the second in late \n2015. He required an assistive walker, crutches, or a cane to walk, through March 2017. \n(Tr. at 57-62, 77-83, 110-111, 135-142, 162-167; GE 2; AE D). \n \n \nApplicant was first prescribed Oxycodone by his doctor after his first hip surgery \nin June 2015. He took Oxycodone daily, as prescribed, from June 2015 through \nFebruary 2017. As discussed above, though he consumed an alcoholic drink socially \nfrom mid-2015 to February 2017, he testified that he did not do so on the days he took \nOxycodone. He testified, \u201c[y]ou\u2019d have good days and you\u2019d have bad days . . . the pain \nwas, sometimes, absolutely extraordinary and, sometimes, it was not bad.\u201d He testified \nthat his prescription for Oxycodone varied: \n \nSometimes they would be for . . . ten 325s, sometimes for 20 325s. And, \nand when I say 20, it\u2019s 20 milligrams of oxycodone, combined with 325 \nmilligrams of Motrin. Or, sometimes, 2,500 of Motrin and, sometimes, just \nlike 20 milligrams of oxycodone with no Motrin. So it was all, it was, kind \nof, a mixed bag and it, you know, it was, you never knew what you were \ngoing to get. \n \nHe never had more than a month\u2019s supply at a given time, so he had to obtain a refill at \nleast monthly. To do so, he had to go through his doctor\u2019s assistant, a nurse \npractitioner, to obtain a signed prescription. (Tr. at 57-62, 77-83, 110-111, 135-142, \n162-167; GE 2; AE D). \n \n \nIn December 2015, Applicant was in severe pain. He testified that he was unable \nto obtain a refill for his then existing Oxycodone prescription because the nurse \npractitioner was on vacation, and neither his doctor nor any of the administrative staff \nreturned his calls. His sister, who resided in a different state, offered to overnight him a \nbottle of her prescription Oxycodone, consisting of \u201ctwenty pills of each pill having ten \nmilligrams of oxycodone and 325 milligrams of Motrin . . . .\u201d He testified that \u201cit got me \nover the hump. It was a gap fill, until such time, as I could get another . . . refill,\u201d which \noccurred approximately less than a week later. (Tr. at 77-83, 110-111, 123-125, 135-\n142, 144, 162-167; GE 2; AE D). \n \n \nAs with Applicant\u2019s use of his then girlfriend\u2019s Xanax in 2015, he testified that he \ndid not believe his use of his sister\u2019s prescription Oxycodone constituted misuse. He \nstated: \n\n \n7 \n \n[Y]ou could say that my . . . method of acquisition might not have been \nexactly right, and I, probably could\u2019ve done that better, but in the grand \nscheme of things, I was using it for the purpose that it was intended. \n \n(Tr. at 77-83, 110-111, 123-125, 135-142, 144, 162-167; AE D, E). \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not realize then that he was doing anything wrong. \nHe testified that he has since learned that he is not to use another individual\u2019s \nprescription, and that in the future, he would go to the emergency room to obtain a new \nprescription. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant testified that the only medications \nhe was taking were for blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood thinner. He signed a \nstatement of intent to not use any illegal substance or abuse prescription drugs in the \nfuture, and that violation would result in the revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 77-83, \n110-111, 123-125, 135-142, 144, 162-167; AE D, E). \n  \n \nApplicant maintained that at the time of the marijuana incident in December \n2014, his use of his then girlfriend\u2019s Xanax in February 2015, and his use of his sister\u2019s \nOxycodone in December 2015, he was eligible for a security clearance but he did not, in \nfact, have one. He testified that he understood that his clearance was inactive because \nhe had been previously read off all classified programs and was not read back on until \naround 2016. When confronted with the AGA\u2019s October 2016 clearance decision \nstatement, which reflects that he had \u201cbeen in SCI access\u201d with the AGA since \nSeptember 2005, and he was granted eligibility for access to SCI by the U.S. military in \nDecember 2010, he responded that any information reflecting that he was in continuous \naccess was \u201cnews to me.\u201d He also testified that his interviews became \u201csomewhat \ncontentious,\u201d and he did not have an opportunity to appeal the eventual unfavorable \n2016 AGA decision because he did not receive the appeal documents in the mail before \nthe appeal period lapsed. (Tr. at 70-73, 81-83, 109-110, 125-132, 147-155, 160-162, \n167-177; GE 1, 2). \n \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s character witnesses, as further discussed below, testified that \nthey believed Applicant had a security clearance in December 2014. One witness was \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor from October 2018 to the date of the hearing. This witness \ntestified that he assisted Applicant with obtaining employment in October 2014 with the \nDOD contractor for whom Applicant worked until October 2018, and he believed \nApplicant\u2019s work there required a clearance from its inception. A second witness worked \nfor the same employer as Applicant in 2014, but in a different sector. This witness \ntestified that he was told that Applicant had \u201ca Top Secret SCI clearance and he was \nover in the cyber-division for two years -- 2014 and 2015 -- as a senior capture \nmanager.\u201d (Tr. at 178-204; AE A, C). \n \n \nSince Applicant did not believe he used marijuana in 2014 or misused Xanax in \n2015, he testified that he did not falsify his responses to sections 23a and 23b of his \nMarch 2015 security clearance application (SCA) or section 23 of his November 2015 \nSCA (SOR 3.d, 3.e, 3.g, 3.h, 3.i). He testified that he did not falsify information during a \nMay 2015 interview with the AGA, when he failed to disclose his 2014 marijuana use \n(SOR 3.f). He also testified that he did not falsify his response to section 23 of his \n\n \n8 \n \nAugust 2017 SCA since he did not believe his misused either Xanax or Oxycodone \n(SOR 3.k). Sections 23a and 23b of his March 2015 SCA inquired, respectively, about \nthe illegal use of controlled substances, to include prescription drugs, in the seven years \nprior to the date of the SCA, and any illegal use of a controlled substance while \npossessing a security clearance. Section 23 of his November 2015 SCA inquired about \nillegal drug use or drug activity, to include the intentional misuse of prescription drugs, in \nthe seven years prior to the date of the SCA, and any illegal use or other involvement \nwith a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. Section 23 of \nhis August 2017 SCA inquired about the intentional misuse of prescription drugs in the \nseven years prior to the date of the SCA.   (Tr. at 90-99, 108-111, 147-155. 167-171; \nGE 1, 2, 3). \n \n \nApplicant, however, listed his December 2014 marijuana use in response to \nsection 23 of his August 2017 SCA, which inquired whether he had illegally used a drug \nor controlled substance in the seven years prior to the date of the SCA. He marked \n\u201cYes,\u201d listed \u201cTHC (Such as marijuana, weed, pot, hashish, etc.)\u201d and explained: \n \nI was at a tailgate for the Army-Navy Game on Dec 13th, 2014 and with a \nbunch of friends in the parking lot; a friend was smoking a joint and \npassed it to me. I took one puff. This was the only instance. . . . One puff, \none time. I am completely at a loss to explain why. \n \nWhen asked whether he intended or not to use marijuana in the future, he noted, \u201cNo, \nthis was a stupid, mindless aberration.\u201d He provided no commentary that he did not \ninhale or ingest the marijuana, that he did not experience any effect from it, or that he \ndid not believe it rose to the level of \u201cuse.\u201d (Tr. at 70-73, 81-83, 109-110, 125-132, 147-\n155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 1, 2). \n \n \nApplicant denied that he stated during an interview with the AGA in December \n2015 that he intended to violate a state\u2019s handgun registration laws by not registering \nhis handguns, as required. He testified that he intended to state that he simply had not \ngotten around to doing so. He testified that he prioritized his work and health issues at \nthe time, but he had no intent to keep unregistered guns. He testified that he complied \nwith the registration laws in November 2016 and registered his one handgun, as he had \ngiven his second one to his son who is a state trooper. (SOR 3.j). (Tr. at 101-108, 155-\n158; GE 2) \n \n \nIn August 2009, Applicant paid a prostitute for sex. He testified that this was the \nonly instance he did so. He was single. His friend suggested it after Applicant was \nlamenting about his dating life. He testified that he was stupid and unaware of the \nramifications of his actions, though he knew his conduct was illegal. He has no future \nintentions of repeating such conduct. (SOR 3.b). (Tr. at 83-85, 142-143; GE 2). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s witnesses described him as generous, trustworthy, reliable, and loyal. \nThey each testified that they reviewed the SOR. Two witnesses referred to Applicant as \na lifelong friend, having known him since their simultaneous attendance at West Point in \nthe 1970s. Both indicated that they have seen Applicant at least once monthly over the \n\n \n9 \n \npast 10 years. One indicated that he was surprised about the accuracy of the SOR, \ngiven his interactions with Applicant. The other indicated that he had never observed \nApplicant consume alcohol to excess, use marijuana, or misuse prescription drugs. This \nwitness testified that he was unaware of Applicant\u2019s 1998 DUI and alleged 2014 \nmarijuana use until he saw the SOR, and that he organized the group of 40 to 50 people \nthat attended the football game in December 2014, where Applicant allegedly used \nmarijuana. This witness testified that he held a security clearance his entire adult life, \nand he knew that illegal drug use and the misuse of prescription drugs was not \npermitted while holding a clearance. If the SOR allegations were proven to be accurate, \nhe believed they were situational and not reflective of Applicant\u2019s overall character. (Tr. \nat 25-48, 178-204; AE B, C). \n  \n \nThe third witness, as previously discussed, consisted of the individual who was \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor from October 2018 to the date of the hearing. The witness \nreferred to Applicant as his best friend, having known him since 1996. Applicant has, at \nvarious times since 2006, worked for this witness. In addition to testifying that \nApplicant\u2019s position with the employer for whom Applicant worked from October 2014 to \nOctober 2018 required a clearance from its inception, the witness also testified that \nApplicant\u2019s position in 2013 when Applicant worked for the witness as a consultant \nrequired a clearance. He described Applicant\u2019s work performance as impeccable. He \ntestified that he socialized with Applicant at monthly poker games, where he observed \nApplicant consume alcohol responsibly. He indicated that he did not observe Applicant \nmisuse prescription drugs or use illegal substances. (Tr. at 178-193; AE A, C). \n \n \nThe fourth witness also referred to Applicant as a lifelong friend, having first met \nhim when they were coworkers from 1997 through 2006. From 2006 to 2014, the \nwitness and Applicant kept in touch through an occasional email. In 2014, as previously \ndiscussed, when Applicant and the witness once again worked for the same employer \nbut in different sectors, the witness testified that he was told that Applicant had a \nclearance in 2014 and 2015. The witness then served as Applicant\u2019s supervisor from \n2016 to 2018. He stated that Applicant\u2019s performance was exceptional. He described \nApplicant as a responsible drinker. He indicated that he was unaware that Applicant had \nallegedly used any illegal substance until he reviewed the SOR. He testified that \nApplicant told him that he took \u201ca puff of marijuana, but was sickened by it immediately, \nand blew it out\u201d in December 2014 at a football game. (Tr. at 193-204; AE C). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n\n \n10 \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG 22. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n\n \n11 \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nThough Applicant only had one DUI charge, in 1998, his pattern of excessive \nalcohol consumption from 2005 to 2015 was concerning. AG 22(a) and 22(c) are \napplicable.   \n \n \nAG 23 provides the following relevant condition that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sole DUI charge and excessive alcohol consumption are unlikely to \nrecur. He testified that the only medications he was taking as of the date of the hearing \nwere for blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood thinner. He also testified that since his \nhip surgery in June 2015, he consumes a drink or two socially with friends to two drinks \na night, two nights a week. His witnesses, to include one who socializes with him at \nmonthly poker games, testified that they consider him to be a responsible drinker. I find \nthat his sole DUI and pattern of excessive alcohol consumption from 2005 to 2015 are \nnot recent, are mitigated by the passage of time, and do not continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG 23(a) is applicable. \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n\n \n12 \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana in December 2014. He disclosed such during his \nDecember 2015 interview with the AGA and on his August 2017 SCA. He also misused \nXanax and Oxycodone in 2015. I do not find credible his testimony that he did not \nunderstand that his actions constituted a misuse of prescription drugs since he used it in \nthe manner that it was supposed to be used and he obtained a prescription of his own \nor a refill of his existing prescription shortly after. His 2014 use of marijuana and his \n2015 misuse of Xanax and Oxycodone occurred after he had been granted a security \nclearance in 2005. I do not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible that he did not \nunderstand that he had a security clearance in 2014 and 2015, when he used marijuana \nand misused Xanax and Oxycodone. AG 25(a) and 25(f) are established. \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns are provided under AG 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nApplicant failed to take responsibility for his 2014 marijuana use, despite \ndisclosing it during his December 2015 interview with the AGA and on his 2017 SCA. \nHe failed to take responsibility for his 2015 misuse of his then girlfriend\u2019s Xanax and his \n\n \n13 \n \nsister\u2019s Oxycodone. He failed to take responsibility for using marijuana in 2014 and \nmisusing Xanax and Oxycodone in 2015 after he had been granted a security clearance \nin 2005. None of the mitigating conditions have been established. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nAG 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \nApplicant displayed untrustworthiness, questionable judgment, and unreliability \nwith his pattern of excessive alcohol consumption from 2005 to 2015; his  payment of a \nprostitute for sex in 2009; his failure to utilize appropriate methods to refill his \nprescription Crestor rather than paying his sister for and using hers in 2013 and 2014; \nhis failure to list his 2014 marijuana use and his 2015 misuse of Xanax, after being \ngranted a security clearance in 2005, on his March and November 2015 SCAs; failure to \ndisclose his 2014 marijuana use during his May 2015 interview with the AGA; his \nindication during a December 2015 interview with the AGA that he intended to violate \nstate handgun registration laws; and his failure to list his 2015 misuse of Xanax and \nOxycodone on his August 2017 SCA.  \n\n \n14 \n \nAs previously discussed, I do not find Applicant credible in his claims that he did \nnot use marijuana in December 2014, he did not misuse Xanax and Oxycodone in \n2015, and he did not understand that he had a security clearance in 2014 and 2015 \nwhen he used marijuana and misused Xanax and Oxycodone. As such, I find that he \nintentionally falsified his March and November 2015 SCAs, his May 2015 interview with \nthe AGA, and his 2017 SCA. AG 16(a), 16(b), and 16(e)(1) are established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG 17 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nI find that AG 17(c) and 17(e) are established for: the alcohol consumption \nsecurity concerns alleged in 3.a, for the same reasons set forth above in my Guideline \nG analysis; the sole instance in 2009 in which Applicant paid a prostitute for sex, \nalleged in 3.b; the only two instances, in 2013 and 2014, when Applicant failed to utilize \nappropriate methods to refill his prescription Crestor, alleged in 3.c; and his clarified \nintention concerning his compliance with state handgun registration laws, alleged in 3.j, \nsince he complied with such laws in November 2016. \n \nHowever, for the same reasons set forth above in my Guideline H analysis, AG \n17(a), 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are not established for the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns alleged in 3.a. For the reasons stated above, I also \nfind that AG 17(a), 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are not established for 3.d, 3.e, 3.f, 3.g, 3.h, \n3.i, and 3.k. Applicant did not make any prompt or good-faith efforts to correct the \nrelevant falsifications on his SCAs from March 2015, November 2015, and August 2017 \nand during his May 2015 interview with the AGA. He continued to dodge responsibility \nfor his use of marijuana in 2014 and his misuse of Xanax and Oxycodone in 2015 while \nholding a security clearance. His reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness remain \nquestionable. \n \n \n\n \n15 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G, H, and E in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable service in the U.S. Army, and his employment with DOD contractors since his \nmilitary discharge. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the security concerns involving personal conduct and drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b - 3.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.d - 3.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.j:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.k:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n16 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Edmunds, Esq. \n \n \n08/14/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant has a significant amount of delinquent debt that she only recently began \nto resolve. She did not mitigate the resulting financial security concerns. National security \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 12, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. Applicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on July 6, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nOn February 7, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned the case to me. On February 12, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting \nthe case for February 27, 2019. Pursuant to Applicant\u2019s request, the hearing was \ncancelled and the case was continued. On May 15, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Video \nTeleconference Hearing scheduling the case for June 12, 2019. The hearing was held as \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nscheduled. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into \nevidence. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through K into \nevidence. All aforementioned exhibits were admitted. Applicant\u2019s Counsel identified AE L \nthrough Q for the record, but did not offer them into evidence because he did have \nsufficient copies of them for Department Counsel. The record remained open until July 8, \n2019, to give Applicant\u2019s Counsel time to provide Department Counsel copies of AE L \nthrough Q, and any additional documents Applicant\u2019s Counsel deemed pertinent. He \ntimely submitted AE L through Q and R through T. All exhibits were admitted. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 20, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Matter \n \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the \nSOR to add two allegations: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: You filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in February 2019. As of the \ndate of your hearing, the bankruptcy petition remains pending.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q: You are indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for \ndelinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $2,000, as of the date of \nyour hearing. The tax debt remains unresolved. \n \nApplicant did not object to the amendments. She admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 \n1.p. She denied the allegation in in SOR \u00b6 1.q. (Tr. 7-9) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p of the SOR. She denied the \nallegation in \u00b6 1.q. Her admissions are incorporated into these findings.  \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. She is separated from her husband. They have a nine-\nyear-old daughter. Applicant has custody of the child. Applicant has a master\u2019s degree in \ntechnology. She began working for her current employer in June 2017. (Tr. 21-22)  \n \n \nApplicant started experiencing financial problems after she was laid off from a \nposition she had held for ten years in May 2006. She was then unemployed from June \n2006 to December 2006. In 2010, 2011, and 2012, she was unemployed for a month or \nmore between positions. She was unemployed from May 2014 until May 2015, after \nanother layoff. She lost her previous job, subsequent to knee surgery in March 2017, \nbecause she was arriving at work late. She remained unemployed for two months, until \nshe started her current position with a defense contractor. (Tr. 29-32, 39; AE A) In addition \nto those periods of unemployment, Applicant had medical issues, house maintenance \nemergencies, unexpected car repairs, and daycare expenses, which contributed to her \nfinancial delinquencies. (Tr. 32-35)  \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBRs) from October 2017 and April 2018, the \nJune 2018 SOR alleged 15 debts that are delinquent, charged off, or in collections. They \ninclude: a $25,061 delinquency on a $331,628 mortgage; past-due credit cards; and \nunpaid medical and miscellaneous bills. These totaled about $42,000, and became \ndelinquent between 2013 and 2017. (GE 2, GE 3)   \n \n \nOn February 2, 2019, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. In April \n2019, she started making monthly payments of $380 to the bankruptcy trustee. As of the \nhearing date, she has made three payments. (Tr. 42; AE L, M) According to documents \nin that petition, Applicant owes $113,777 in non-priority unsecured claims and $108,891 \nin secured claims. (AE S) All of the alleged SOR delinquent debts, including a federal tax \ndebt, are included in this bankruptcy. (Tr. 23-24) Applicant said that some debts included \nin the bankruptcy are not delinquent.   \n \n \n \nIn her Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, Applicant listed the IRS as a creditor, to \nwhom she owes $2,000 for unpaid Federal taxes. (AE S) However, she denied owing any \ntaxes during her testimony. (Tr. 44) According to her Federal tax return for 2018, which \nwas recently filed, she does not owe any additional taxes for 2018. (AE S) She did not \nprovide proof from the IRS confirming that she does not have an outstanding tax debt for \n2018 or previous years. \n \n \nApplicant earns $104,000 annually. (Tr. 46) She earned $85,000 in 2016; $78,000 \nin 2017; and $80,000 in 2018. (Tr. 40, 58; AE S) According to the Chapter 13 petition, \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $5,500 and her monthly expenses are $1,100. She said \nthat she has spent the additional money on doctor and lawyer fees, house and car repairs, \nand incidental childcare costs over several months. She does not keep a current written \nbudget. (Tr. 49-50) She has about $22,000 in a savings account and $150,000 in a \nretirement account. (Tr. 51) \n \n \nApplicant submitted three letters of recommendation. A former colleague, who has \nknown Applicant for 13 years, stated that she is trustworthy, competent, and \nknowledgeable. (AE O) A friend, for many years, has worked with Applicant as a volunteer \nfor community organizations and boards. He complimented her for her financial integrity \nas displayed in different projects. (AE P) A pastor from Applicant\u2019s church stated that \nApplicant is responsible, trustworthy, and a leader. (AE Q) \n \n \nApplicant testified candidly about her financial problems. She is remorseful and \ncommitted to resolving her debts through the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (Tr. 35) She \ncompleted credit counseling and debtor education courses through the bankruptcy court. \n(AE I, J) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n \n \n \n \n4\namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out three disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nBased on her admissions and credit reports, Applicant accumulated 15 delinquent \ndebts between 2013 and 2017, which she did not begin to address until February 2019 \nwhen she filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. She also has an outstanding Federal tax \ndebt. The record evidence establishes security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(f).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 sets out five conditions that could potentially mitigate those financial \nsecurity concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant began accumulating delinquent accounts in 2013, which she did not \ndiligently address until February 2019, after receiving the SOR in June 2018. To date \nnone of alleged debts or tax debt is paid or resolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial delinquencies to sporadic periods of \nunemployment over the years as a result of layoffs, and unexpected emergencies related \nto medical conditions, house repairs, and being a single mother. Those circumstances \nhave been beyond her control; however, one period or unemployment resulted after she \nwas terminated from a position for tardiness. She did not establish full mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(b) because she failed to provide evidence that she responsibly managed her \ndebts under those circumstances and throughout those periods.  \n \n \nIn February 2019, Applicant completed credit counseling and debtor education \ncourses in conjunction with filing for bankruptcy. She provided proof that all SOR debts \nare included in that bankruptcy, and that she made three payments into the plan to begin \nresolving them. There is some evidence that those debts are coming under control, \nestablishing limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). The evidence establishes minimal \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) as to all debts because she waited a long time to make a \npost-SOR good-faith effort to begin resolving her financial issues. There is no evidence \nthat Applicant has resolved or is resolving the alleged Federal tax debt. AG \u00b6 20(g) does \nnot apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an educated woman who has worked for a Federal contractor since \nthe June 2017. Her financial problems began in 2013 and continue into the present. She \ncredibly asserted that she has had periods of unemployment and unexpected \nemergencies since then that affected her ability to resolve her debts. While those are valid \nexplanations, she did not initiate diligent efforts to address her significant number of \ndelinquent debts until February 2019 through bankruptcy. Although learning of the \nGovernment\u2019s security concerns in June 2018, she did not submit proof that she paid or \nresolved any of the debts, including a small medical debt for $122. Rather, she waited \nalmost a year to take responsible actions. She did not submit a budget indicating that she \nhas the ability to resolve her debts or avoid future overspending. She appears to be \ncommitted to making payments into her bankruptcy plan, but has not yet established a \nsufficient track record of doing so. Nor has she resolved a tax debt, which is listed in her \nbankruptcy. \n \nThe record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a \nsecurity clearance at this time. Applicant failed to mitigate all of the security concerns \narising under the financial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.q:  \n    \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant illegally used marijuana between 2005 and May 2018. He used \nmarijuana after he submitted his security clearance application (SCA) in May 2017, and \nafter he was questioned about his illegal marijuana use during a background interview \nin December 2017. The passage of time so far is insufficient to demonstrate his \nreliability, trustworthiness, ability to comply with the law, rules and regulations, and his \nability to protect classified information. Drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Clearance denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a SCA on May 23, 2017. He was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator on December 13, 2017. After reviewing the information \ngathered during the background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse) on June 18, 2018. Applicant answered the SOR on \nJune 25, 2018, and requested a decision based on the record in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), submitting the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant by letter dated \n02/28/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nAugust 10, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on August 15, 2018. He was allowed 30 \ndays to submit any objections to the FORM and to provide material to refute, extenuate, \nand mitigate the concerns. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was \nassigned to me on December 10, 2018. Lacking any objections, I admitted and \nconsidered the Government\u2019s proposed evidence.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the sole SOR allegation under Guideline H. In his SOR \nanswer he noted that he disclosed his marijuana use in his 2017 SCA, and that his use \nof marijuana was legal in his state of residence. He promised to discontinue using \nmarijuana if required for his job or clearance eligibility. His admission is incorporated as \na finding of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 2006, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010, and received a doctorate \ndegree (Ph.D.) from a prestigious U.S. university in 2017. He is engaged to be married. \nHe has no children.  \n \nBetween 2010 and 2016, Applicant worked as a research assistant at the \nuniversity where he earned his doctorate degree. His current employer and clearance \nsponsor, a federal contactor, hired him in 2016, and he has worked there ever since. In \nhis response to Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his May 2017 SCA, \nApplicant disclosed that he illegally used marijuana between June 2005 and April 2017. \nHe stated that had not participated in substance-abuse counseling.  \n \nDuring his December 2017 background interview with a government investigator, \nApplicant confirmed that he illegally used marijuana about weekly during social \noccasions, and for pain management for sports-related injuries, between 2005 and \nDecember 2017. He noted that his fianc\u00e9e, siblings, and friends were aware of his \nmarijuana use. He told the investigator that he was not marijuana dependent. He \npromised to stop using marijuana if required for his job or clearance eligibility. In his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated that his most recent use of \nmarijuana occurred on May 26, 2018. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.    \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.  \n \nBetween 2005 and May 2018, Applicant illegally used marijuana. He illegally \nused marijuana after submitting his May 2017 SCA, and after being questioned about \nhis illegal marijuana use during a background interview in December 2017. Moreover, \nhe continued to use marijuana at least until he answered DOHA interrogatories in May \n2018. AG \u00b6 25 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia \n \nThe record established the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \n\n \n5 \n \n \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a long history of illegal \nmarijuana use. Applicant started his illegal use of marijuana during high school (2006), \nand he continued using marijuana until at least May 2018. He knew that the possession \nof marijuana was illegal. Moreover, he knew the illegal use of drugs was a concern for \nthe Federal government because he was asked about it in his May 2017 SCA, and \nduring his December 2017 background interview. Notwithstanding, he continued his \nillegal marijuana use until May 2018.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s long-term illegal use of marijuana after submitting a SCA and \nknowing about the concerns raised by it cast doubts on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations, and suitability to hold a clearance. \n \nI considered that Applicant self-reported his past illegal marijuana use in his 2017 \nSCA. I also considered that he promised in his SCA and during his background \ninterview to stop illegally using marijuana, if required for his job and his clearance \neligibility. I consider Applicant\u2019s promises to be lacking weight and credibility. Applicant \nknew the possession of marijuana is illegal under Federal law. He became aware of the \nsecurity concerns it raised when he submitted his SCA and when he was questioned \nabout his illegal use of marijuana during his background interview. Notwithstanding, the \nnotice that he received concerning the security concern about marijuana, he was not \ndissuaded from using marijuana until at least May 2018.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeals Board has stated that \u201cDrug involvement after having \ncompleted an SCA draws into serious questions the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations, insofar as it placed the applicant on notice of \nthe consequences of such misconduct. ISCR Case No. 16-02877, at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, \n2017). Additionally, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show that he no longer \nassociates with illegal marijuana users or dealers. More mitigating evidence and \nadditional time without recurrence of substance misuse is needed for Applicant to \nestablish his reliability, trustworthiness, his ability to comply with laws rules and \nregulations, and his suitability for a clearance. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He attended \nprestigious U.S. universities and achieved a Ph.D. He has worked for a federal \ncontractor since 2016. Applicant disclosed his substance misuse in his 2017 SCA. He \nstated his intent to not use marijuana illegally if required for his job or clearance \neligibility.  \n \nThe factors against granting a clearance are more substantial. Applicant\u2019s lack of \njudgment and his unwillingness to comply with the law, rules, and regulations continue \nto raise questions about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. His lack of judgment is demonstrated by his \ncontinued use of marijuana after submitting his 2017 SCA, and after being questioned \nabout his use of marijuana during a background interview in December 2017, until at \nleast May 2018. He demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to follow Federal law. \nThe substance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He is praised for his diligence, responsibility, honesty, intelligence, \ndependability, trustworthiness, loyalty, professionalism, work ethic, leadership, \nreliability, dedication, integrity, and loyalty to the U.S. forces he supported.6 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n                                                          \n6 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, M, P. \n\n \n4 \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, five children, mother, seven siblings, in-laws, and extended \nfamily members are citizens and residents of Iraq. The potential for terrorist violence \nagainst U.S. interests and citizens remains high in Iraq, and it continues to have human \nrights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \n\n \n5 \n \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable:  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq \ncould not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. The \nAppeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of limited value, \nunless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar manner in the \npast in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous track record of \ncomplying with security regulations and procedures in the context of dangerous, high-\nrisk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the national security.7 \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed \nthis issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \n                                                          \n7 ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). \n\n \n6 \n \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist for the U.S. military, \ncoalition forces, and civilian government and reconstruction teams in Iraq from 2003 to \n2009. He was heavily praised by members of the U.S. military and civilian personnel, \nwhich earned him a special immigrant visa. I find that Applicant can be expected to \nresolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is \napplicable.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Iraq earned him high praise from U.S. \nmilitary and civilian coalition personnel. The Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s \nproven record of action in defense of the United States is very important and can lead to \na favorable result for an applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d8 The complicated state of \naffairs in Iraq places a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that \nhis foreign family members do not pose an unacceptable security risk. He has met that \nburden.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n                                                          \n8 ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007). \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Charles Bell, Personal Representative \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected \nInformation). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 14, 2016. On \nJune 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent her a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nK.1 Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 20, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 20, 2018, scheduling the \nhearing for August 27, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) were revised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein. \n02/06/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant and \nthree witnesses testified, and Applicant Exhibit (AE) A was admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 6, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old personnel security representative for a defense \ncontractor, employed since 2008. She was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006 and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2012. She is married and has no children. She has held a security \nclearance since 2008. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant had four security infractions from 2008 to 2017. She \nadmitted the allegations, with explanations. In 2008, while new to the company, Applicant \ninadvertently carried a camera in her handbag into a closed area where she worked. She \nsat at her desk, and was looking through her handbag when she discovered the camera. \nAt the time, cameras, but not cell phones, were prohibited in the space. The camera \nremained off, and Applicant immediately showed the camera to her security manager. \nThe company reported that no classified information was put at risk in the incident. \n \nIn 2015, Applicant inadvertently scanned two program access requests (PAR) into \na computer system. The PAR is unclassified but contains sensitive personal information. \nApplicant and another employee, both new to the position, were tasked to scan thousands \nof PARs as a group, into a computer system. The employees were not required to review \neach document for sensitive information, but a random check was done. After the PARs \nwere entered into the computer system, Applicant noticed two PARs with sensitive \ninformation that should not have been scanned, and reported it to her security manager. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, the company\u2019s security manager, testified that the incident was \nnot Applicant\u2019s fault, rather, she completed the task as directed and could not have known \nthe two particular PARs in the stack of PARs held sensitive information. The incident was \nreported and investigated as an infraction so that it could be properly documented, but no \nloss or compromise of sensitive information was found. \n \nIn 2016, Applicant was again tasked to scan documents into a computer system, \nbut to redact with a black marker, sensitive, unclassified data on some documents before \nscanning them. According to Applicant\u2019s security manager, Applicant followed directions \nexactly as tasked, but noticed that some redacted documents still showed information \nthrough the redaction after scanning. Again, the security manager testified that Applicant \nwas not at fault for the incident, but that she followed directions exactly as tasked, and \nApplicant reported the incident as soon as it was discovered. The company\u2019s method of \nredaction was changed. Again, the incident was reported and investigated as an infraction \nso that it could be properly documented, but no loss or compromise of sensitive \ninformation was found. \n \nIn 2017, Applicant allowed an unauthorized individual into a classified space. \nApplicant was tasked to provide a classified security briefing to new employees. She was \nprovided a classified cover sheet from the government client, listing employees to be \n\n \n3 \n \nbriefed. The cover sheet identified all listed employees as cleared, but the underlying PAR \nfor one of the employees was \u201cdisapproved\u201d and should not have appeared on the cover \nsheet. Applicant reviewed the cover sheet, but did not realize that one employee listed \nwas disapproved on his PAR. Applicant conducted the brief, but afterward she found that \nthe cover sheet misidentified the employee as approved for the brief and reported the \nincident to her supervisor. The employee was eventually approved for the brief. The \nincident was referred to the on-site Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) agent, \nwho testified on behalf of Applicant. The OSI agent indicated that the government client \nmisidentified the employee, and that the improper briefing was not the fault of Applicant. \nHe has worked with Applicant on a regular basis and believes she is honest and \ntrustworthy. He unequivocally recommends Applicant retain her security clearance.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged the security incidents and took responsibility for all of the \nincidents, despite the fact that three of the four incidents were outside of her responsibility.  \nThe company compliance lead, Applicant\u2019s current security manager, and on-site OSI \nagent testified on behalf of Applicant and attested that she was not directly responsible \nfor the last three incidents and the camera incident was minor. They all believe that \nApplicant\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness make her a unique fit for the security office and \nthat she complies with security rules and regulations. Applicant promptly reported all \ninfractions once discovered and learned how to prevent further incidents in the future. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n4 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the handling protected information security concern: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \nRelevant conditions that could raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 34 and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of protected information to \nunauthorized persons, including, but not limited to, personal or business \ncontacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or \nconferences; and \n\n \n5 \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s involvement in the security incidents alleged in the SOR are generally \ninsufficient to directly implicate disqualifying security concerns under AG \u00b6 34. However, \neven if Applicant\u2019s record of involvement or relationship with security infractions raises \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 34, they are clearly mitigated under AG \u00b6 35. \n \nRelevant conditions that could mitigate security concerns under AG \u00b6 35 include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n \n \nExcept for a minor infraction in 2008 when Applicant inadvertently took an unused \ncamera in her handbag into a closed facility, the more significant infractions were not \ncaused by Applicant\u2019s intentional actions or negligence. Applicant performed her duties \nas directed, but the direction and training were insufficient to prevent the security incidents \nfrom occurring. Applicant self-reported all of the incidents, learned to prevent them in the \nfuture, and is more attune to the potential pitfalls during similar tasks. Her compliance \nlead, security manager, and on-site OSI agent who works closely with Applicant strongly \nsupport her and attest to her trustworthiness and honesty. AG \u00b6\u00b6 35 (a), (b), (c), and (d) \napply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \n\n \n6 \n \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline K in my whole-person analysis. Applicant is a mature \nemployee with many years of handling classified information in sensitive spaces, and she \nis trusted and honest. She has acknowledged the security lapses that led to the incidents \nin question, and understands how to prevent such occurrences going forward. The \nfavorable record evidence is sufficient to fully mitigate the security concerns raised in the \nSOR. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for continued access to classified information.

Karoian, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \nOn June 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.  \nOn July 11, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the \nrecord. Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September \n5, 2018. On September 18, 2018, Applicant received the FORM. Applicant had 30 days \nto submit a response to the FORM. He timely submitted a response which is admitted \nas Item 9. Department Counsel had no objection to the documents Applicant submitted \nin response to the FORM. (Item 10) On October 23, 2018, the FORM was forwarded to \nthe Hearing Office and assigned to me on December 17, 2018. Based upon a review of \nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.    \n01/28/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a DOD contractor seeking a security \nclearance. He has worked for his current employer since October 2010. His highest \nlevel of education is a high school diploma. He is divorced and has a 16-year-old son \nwho lives with him. (Item 3) \n \nOn March 21, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing. (Item 3) A subsequent background investigation revealed \nApplicant had the following issues under the financial considerations concern: a Chapter \n13 bankruptcy filed in August 2017, claiming approximately $63,500 in outstanding \nliabilities (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 4, Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2); a $17,819 state tax lien entered \nagainst Applicant in 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 7 at 2), a $1,326 state tax lien entered \nagainst Applicant in 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 7 at 2); a $15,118 federal tax lien entered \nagainst Applicant in 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Item 7 at 3); a $3,912 judgment owed to a state \nentered against Applicant in 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Item 5); Applicant failed to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns from 2010 to 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Item 8); and Applicant failed \nto timely file his state income tax return for tax year 2013. (SOR \u00b6 1.g). In his response \nto the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations. (Item 2)  \n  \nApplicant encountered tax issues when he changed his W4 deductions in order \nto increase the size of his paycheck because he and his then wife wanted to pay off \nsome debts so they could purchase a house. His wife was unfaithful and they divorced \nin 2008. A long custody battle for their son ensued. Applicant was also laid off between \nMay 2009 and April 2010. (Item 3, section 13A; Item 8 at 5; Response to Form) \nApplicant failed to file tax returns or pay taxes from 2010 to 2015. He failed to file tax \nreturns for those years because he was afraid to learn how much he owed in taxes. He \nestimates he filed  tax returns for 2009 to 2011 a few years ago. He filed returns for tax \nyears 2012 to 2014 on March 17, 2017. Applicant did not provide a copy of his tax \nreturns. He estimates that he owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) a total amount of \n$20,000. He did not provide any statements from the IRS, such as tax transcripts \nindicating the total amount owed to include tax and penalties. (Item 8 at 5) \n \nInternal Revenue Service Publication 908, Bankruptcy Tax Guide (IRS Pub 908)  \nstates that the Bankruptcy Code requires Chapter 13 debtors to file all required tax \nreturns for tax periods ending within four years of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy filing. All \nfederal tax returns must be filed before the date set for the first meeting of creditors. IRS \nPub 908 also states that the Bankruptcy Code requires debtors to file tax returns that \nbecome due after commencement of the bankruptcy or obtain an extension for filing a \nreturn before the due date. If the debtor does not timely file federal tax returns, the \nbankruptcy court must dismiss or convert the case to another chapter of the Bankruptcy \nCode.  Considering that the Bankruptcy Court approved Applicant\u2019s payment plan, it is \nlikely he filed his federal tax returns.   \n \nOn August 25, 2017, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13.  He listed  \ntotal assets of $34,200 and total liabilities of $62,529. Of that amount, approximately \n\n \n3 \n \n \n$20,997 consisted of taxes and other debts Applicant owed the government. (Item 4) \nDuring the bankruptcy proceedings, a state department of labor obtained a $3,912 \njudgment against Applicant for receiving unemployment benefits between June 19, \n2010, and July 24, 2010, when he was actually employed during that period. The \nBankruptcy Court adjudged this debt as nondischargeable. (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Item 5)  \n \nThe Bankruptcy Court approved a five-year repayment plan where Applicant \nmakes monthly payments of $364.62 per pay period. The payment is deducted from his \npay check. Applicant provided copies of his earnings statement from August 25, 2017, \nto September 27, 2018, which indicates that he is making payments towards his \nChapter 13 plan on a regular basis. (Response to FORM) Applicant did not provide a \ncomplete copy of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, to include his Chapter 13 repayment plan. \nAs such, there is no information about which creditors are being paid under the Chapter \n13 repayment plan.  \n \nApplicant states that he filed bankruptcy in order to stop the penalties and late \npayment fees that were building up because of his poor choices when he was younger. \nHe wants to be responsible for his debts. (Response to FORM)  In his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant provided a copy of a Satisfaction of Judgment regarding the $17,819 \nstate tax judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Item 2 at 4)  SOR \u00b6 1.b is found for Applicant. \nThe status of the $1,326 state tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.c) entered against Applicant in 2012 \nremains uncertain.  Applicant did not discuss or provide evidence that he filed his state \nincome return for tax year 2013. (SOR \u00b6 g)  \n \nApplicant admits he made many mistakes with his finances, but now believes he \nis on the correct path and is making sound financial decisions. He currently pays all of \nhis bills on time. He is planning for his son\u2019s future, who is now a junior in high school. \nHe takes pride in his work and would love the opportunity to apply his skill set to a new \nprogram that requires a security clearance. (Response to FORM)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis   \n \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n\n \n5 \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f)  failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.   \n  \nAll of the above disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant incurred \nsignificant state and federal tax debts between 2010 to 2015. He failed to timely federal \ntax returns for those same years and failed to timely file his 2013 state tax returns. He \nfiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in August 2017 because of his financial situation.     \n \nThe security concern under Financial Considerations is broader than the \npossibility that a person might knowingly compromise classified information to obtain \nmoney or something else of value. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-\ncontrol, judgment, and other important qualities.  \n \nThe record establishes that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2010 through 2015, and a state income tax return in 2013. The \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \n\n \n6 \n \n \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the \napplicant\u2019s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent \nsuch problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness in light of [applicant\u2019s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR \nCase No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, \nno foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well that \nends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raised \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \nfinancial counseling service, and there are clear indications the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial issues are ongoing. He \nintentionally did not file his income tax returns over a period of six years and is still \npaying the debt owed to the IRS, apparently through his Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  While \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant provided proof that he made timely payments towards his Chapter 13 over a \none-year period, four years remain on the Chapter 13 repayment plan. Considering the \nlengthy number of years Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns, it is too \nsoon to conclude such behavior will not be repeated.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control \nadversely affected his financial situation to include his divorce in 2008, custody battle \nand period of unemployment from 2009 to 2010. However, this mitigating condition is \ngiven less weight because Applicant did not timely file or pay his federal tax returns \nfrom 2010 to 2015. This occurred after his divorce. Applicant did not provide a sufficient \nreason for not timely filing and paying his federal income taxes. He did not file his \nreturns because he was afraid of how much he owed. He did not act responsibly under \nthe circumstances. For this reason, this mitigating condition is given less weight.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant completed the financial counseling \nrequired by the Bankruptcy court as part of his bankruptcy filing. His financial situation \nappears to be under control and he appears to be meeting the terms of his payment \nplan.  However, there are four years remaining on his Chapter 13 payment plan and it is \ntoo soon to predict that Applicant will make timely payments the full five years.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies with regard to the state tax judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant \nprovided proof in his Answer to the SOR that the judgment was satisfied in August \n2012.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply because Applicant still has significant federal tax debt. \nWhile he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy, he has not made a direct arrangement with the \nIRS to resolve his federal tax debt. He provided no evidence that he is working with \nstate tax authorities regarding his failure to file his 2013 state tax returns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s employment history with a DOD contractor since \nOctober 2010. I considered that circumstances beyond his control contributed to his \nfinancial problems to include a divorce and custody battle. I considered that he has sole \ncustody of his son. However, it was Applicant\u2019s responsibility to timely file his federal \nand state tax returns and pay any taxes owed. He did not file his federal tax returns \nfrom 2010 to 2015, resulting in a significant federal tax debt. He admitted that he did not \nfile his 2013 state tax returns, but provided no updates on the status of 2013 state tax \nreturn. Applicant has taken positive steps towards resolving his federal tax debts \nthrough a Chapter 13 repayment plan. Considering his past history of failing to file his \nfederal income tax returns over a six-year period, it is too soon to conclude Applicant \nwill successfully complete the terms of his Chapter 13 payment plan. If he continues to  \nmake timely payments on his Chapter 13 payment plan, timely file and pay his federal \nand state tax returns, and his regular debts and expenses, he may qualify for a security \nclearance in the future. At this time, the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c \u2013 1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Henderson, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Jessica Coronado, Esq., Grady & Associates \n \n \nFebruary 7, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStatement of Case \n \nOn June 13, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations; Guideline E, Personal Conduct; and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective for cases after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 10, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on August 29, 2018.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 15, \n2018, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 4, 2018. The \nGovernment offered seven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7, \n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered five exhibits at the \nhearing, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E, which were admitted without \nobjection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on December 13, 2018. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 42 years old.  He is married with two children from his current \nmarriage, and one from a prior marriage.  He has a high school diploma, military \ntraining, and some college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Project \nManager.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.   Applicant has been working for his current employer since September \n2016. \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \n \nThe Government alleges in the SOR that the Applicant engaged in conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations that raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleges in the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance \nbecause he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government alleges in the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for clearance for \nengaging in criminal conduct that creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness, and calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations.   \n \n \nApplicant admits, with an explanation, each of the allegations set forth under \neach of the guidelines noted above.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated January 7, \n2012; December 13, 2016; and August 27, 2018, confirm each of the debts listed in the \nSOR.  (Government Exhibits 5, 6, and 7.)  Applicant served in the United States Navy \nfor thirteen years from February 1998 until March 2008.   \n \nWhile serving in the Navy, on or about August 9, 2007, Applicant pled guilty to \nLarceny, under Article 121 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for stealing \nOverseas Base Housing Allowance in the approximate amount of $31,938.70; and \nForgery, under Article 132 of the UCMJ, for fraud against the United States for providing \nforged documents in the furtherance of the crime of larceny.  From October 2005 to \n\n \n3 \n \nFebruary 2007 Applicant received Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) for his \ndependants living in the Philippines.  Applicant submitted a lease agreement to his \ncommand that showed that his family rented a house for about $1,400 US dollars a \nmonth in the Philippines, and per DoD regulations, Applicant is entitled to the amount of \nrent plus utilities in OHA.  Subsequently, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \nchecked Applicant\u2019s designated residence on the lease and found that Applicant\u2019s \nfamily were not living there.  Applicant was provided his rights and confessed to creating \na fake lease to receive OHA, by falsely representing that his family was living in the \nPhilippines.  He submitted the forged document to the Government as a real document.  \nBy providing this fake lease to the Government, Applicant was able to obtain \napproximately $32,000 in money that he was not authorized to receive.  (Tr. p. 28.)  \nApplicant was found guilty at a Special Court-Martial.  Applicant spent 30 days in the \nbrig, 60 days restriction afterwards, reduction in rate to E-3, and forfeiture of pay of \n$1,100 for six months.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  Applicant was administratively \ndischarged from his military service due to his actions. In March 2008, as a result of his \nmisconduct, Applicant received an Other than Honorable Discharge.  (Tr. p. 31.) \n \nAfter being discharged from the military, Applicant did not attempt to pay off his \ndebt.  Almost eleven years have past since this incident occurred and Applicant did not \neven attempt to pay the debt back to the Government.  The debt was eventually \ncharged off in the approximate amount of $46,094.  Applicant testified that at some \npoint he noticed that his Federal income tax refunds were being garnished, but he did \nnot pay much attention.  (Tr. pp. 37 - 38.)  In December 2018 or early January 2019, \nApplicant made his first voluntary payment toward resolving the debt of $100.  (Tr. p. \n35.)   \n \n \nTwo letters of recommendation submitted on Applicant\u2019s behalf from his Program \nManager and from his Team Manager indicate that they consider the Applicant to be a \nhard worker, who is intelligent, punctual, and who consistently goes above and beyond \nto complete the tasks assigned to him.  His is also described as a diligent and reliable \nteam member and a role model for others.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \n\n \n4 \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:       \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and   \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by for foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group.   \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing;  \n \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in \nthat country; and \n \n \n(f) violation of a written recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \n \n \nApplicant deliberately committed a fraud against the Government, and stole \nthousands of dollars from the Government that he has still not paid back.  He forged a \nlease agreement to receive benefits that he was not authorized to receive.  What makes \nthe situation even worse, is the fact that he was serving in the United States military at \nthe time he committed the offenses.  He was trusted to serve and protect the interests \nof United States, and he failed.  Although this misconduct occurred nearly eleven years \nago, it is so eggregious and goes to the core of why the DoD is concerned about the \nprotection of national security.  Applicant was not honest with the Government eleven \nyears ago, and has still not shown that he is reliable and trustworthy.  Under the \ncircumstances, there is no excuse for Applicant\u2019s significant breach of trust.  There are \nno applicable conditions that could be mitigating under AG \u00b6 17.     \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n\n \n6 \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional  financial breaches of trust. \n  \n \nAlthough Applicant did incur the debt over ten years ago, he only recently started \nto make payments to resolve it.  The debt has increased since he incurred it.  He now \nowes approximately $46,094.  This does not show a good faith effort to resolve his debt.  \nHe remains excessively indebted.  At this time, there is insufficient evidence of \nrehabilitation.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \n  \nIt is noted that Applicant\u2019s misconduct in the past occurred almost eleven years \nago.  However, as eggregious as it was, over the years, Applicant totally ignored the \ndebt, and did absolutely nothing until recently to try to resolve it.  Recently, meaning \nonly after he applied for a security clearance, and realized it could be an obstacle for \nhim in obtaining a security clearance.  This debt owed to the Government for fraudulent \ncriminal conduct should have been paid back as soon as possible.  Applicant still owes \nthe debt and little has been done over the years to resolve it.  At this point, it cannot be \nsaid that he is financially stable, that he has shown good judgment, or that he has made \na good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness.    \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15. \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation.  This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and  \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Applicant has failed to provide \nsufficient evidence in mitigation.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Personal Conduct, Financial Considerations, and Criminal Conduct \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n    Statement of the Case \nOn June 8, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence).1 In a response dated August 9, 2018, Applicant admitted the sole allegation \nraised and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I was assigned this case on November 1, 2018. On \nJanuary 7, 2019, a notice was issued setting the hearing for January 24, 2019. The \nhearing commenced as scheduled.  \nThe Government offered three documents, which were accepted into the record \nwithout objection as Government exhibits (Exs.) 1-3. Applicant gave testimony, \nintroduced four witnesses, and offered four items, which were accepted into the record \nwithout objection as Exs. A-D. A transcript (Tr.) of the proceedings was received on \nFebruary 5, 2019, and the record was closed.  After my review of the record as a whole, \nand in light of the applicable directive, I find that Applicant failed to mitigate foreign \ninfluence security concerns. \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after September 1, 2006. Since that time, the AG were amended. The \npresent AG, applied here, is in effect for any adjudication dated on or after June 8, 2017.  \n03/08/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n  Request for Administrative Notice  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about the People\u2019s Republic of China (China). The request was offered \nas Government Ex. 3. Applicant did not object to its admission. I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in the request that are supported by source \ndocuments from official U.S. Government publications.2 The facts considered include, \nbut are not limited to, the following: \n \nChina has an authoritarian government, dominated by its Communist Party. It \nhas a poor human rights record. China suppresses political dissent, engages in arbitrary \narrests and detentions, forced confessions, torture, mistreatment of prisoners, and \nreligious suppression.  \n \nChina is the world\u2019s most active and persistent perpetrator of economic \nespionage. It is among the most aggressive countries in seeking sensitive and protected \nU.S. technology, as well as military and economic intelligence. China targets the United \nStates with active intelligence-gathering programs, both legal and illegal. Its focus is on \nobtaining information and technologies from the United States that could be beneficial to \nChina\u2019s military modernization and economic development.  \n \nChina\u2019s intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, \nfrequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can \nuse their insider access at work to steal trade secrets, often using removable media \ndevices or e-mail. Recent cases involving actual or attempted espionage by China \nagainst the United States, as well as incidents involving the illegal export of sensitive \ntechnology to China, exist.  \n \nIn China, authorities routinely monitor telephone conversations, facsimile \ntransmissions, e-mail, text messaging, and Internet communications. Authorities open \nand censor mail. Its security services have entered personal residences and offices to \ngain access to computers, telephones and fax machines. Hotel guest rooms are \nsometimes bugged and searched for sensitive or proprietary materials. The U.S. State \nDepartment warns that United States citizens have been interrogated or detained for \nreasons stated to be related to \u201cstate security\u201d whilst in China. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old information technology professional (assistant \nadministrator) who has worked in the same capacity for various contractors for almost \n12 years. She has been in her current job for eight years. Applicant has earned a \n                                                          \n2 I also take notice of an Associated Press (AP) article, dated September 10, 2018, by Christopher \nBodeen (Group: Officials destroying crosses, burning bibles in China): \u201cChina\u2019s government is ratcheting \nup a crackdown on Christian congregations in Beijing and several provinces, destroying crosses, burning \nbibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith, according to \npastors and a group that monitors religion in China. . . . The campaign corresponds with a drive to \n\u201cSinicize\u201d religion by demanding loyalty to the officially atheist Communist Party and eliminating any \nchallenge to its power over people\u2019s lives. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \nbachelor\u2019s degree, completed two years of post-graduate study, and received a post-\ngraduate certificate. Applicant is proud of her U.S. citizenship and this country. \nMoreover, she enjoys her right to vote and her ability to serve on a jury.  \n \nRaised in China, Applicant and her husband immigrated to the United States in \n1999 after living in Europe for several years. She became a United States citizen in \n2010. The couple has two adult children who were raised and educated in the United \nStates. The couple owns their own home. Remaining in China as citizens and residents \nare Applicant\u2019s mother, father, one sister, and Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law.  \n \nA well-regarded colleague, neighbor, and friend, Applicant, her husband, and \nchildren have notable roots in their community. They are active in their Christian faith \nand have a strong interest in the faith and culture of their Jewish friends. Applicant\u2019s \nhusband has a long history of work for the United States government and with American \nmedia. They believe they have been fortunate to build careers and a family in the United \nStates over the past two decades.  \n \nApplicant has worked to impress upon her family and in-laws in China \u201chow much \nshe loves this country\u201d and has \u201cshared with all her four elder parents her most \nimportant treasure, her Christian faith.\u201d (Tr. 26) Applicant also has one sister who is a \nlong-term citizen of the United States, where she has raised her own family. Another \nsister lives close to their parents in China, where the sibling and her parents visit \nmultiple times a week. (Tr. 40) Applicant maintains contact with her parents anywhere \nfrom daily to multiple times a week via telephone, email, and social media. She regularly \ncontacts her sister in China. Applicant\u2019s husband communicates with his parents \nweekly. Applicant visits her family in China annually. (Tr. 41, 45) Her parents and sister \nhave visited the United States from China once or twice in the past decade. (Tr. 42-43) \n \n \nApplicant is personally aware of the nature of the Chinese government. During \nthe uprising at Tiananmen Square in 1989, Applicant joined her fellows from academe \nin demonstration against that government. As a result, she was interrogated several \ntimes and threatened with imprisonment. During China\u2019s Cultural Revolution, her \nparents and in-laws \u201call were made to suffer physically and emotionally, how bad you \ncan\u2019t imagine.\u201d (Tr. 33) None of these kin mention Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s work with a \nU.S. governmental entity. (Tr. 33) She noted that her husband\u2019s employment placed \nthem at risk every year when they traveled to China. (Tr. 33) Every time they return to \nChina they keep a \u201cvery low profile . . . and don\u2019t want to tell people where [they] work \nbecause [they are] concerned and worried about [their] security.\u201d (Tr. 33) Applicant \nnoted: \u201cevery time when we go back to China, we feel our life is threatened.\u201d (Tr. 37) \n \nIn the past, a few of Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s siblings were contacted to talk to the \npolice. (Tr. 34, 44) The siblings feel threatened because of Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s work. \n(Tr. 37) Applicant stated: \u201c[the police] want to warn them \u2018why your brother works for [his \nemployer?] . . . kind of threatening, you know?\u2019 Even our relatives feel a threat because \nmy husband works for [that entity]. It\u2019s an anti-China entity.\u201d (Tr. 34) The brothers have \nbeen asked to observe and report on Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s activities. (Tr. 38, 44) One \nparticular contact left a brother scared. (Tr. 44) Consequently, Applicant and her \nhusband try to keep a low profile in order to avoid trouble for their families. (Tr. 44)  \n\n \n \n4 \n \nIt was also noted that Applicant\u2019s parents and parents-in-law, all of whom are in \ntheir mid- to late-80s or early-90s and in declining health, are Christians. Because of \ntheir age and faith, they \u201ckeep a low profile in their daily lives\u201d in China. (Tr. 36) \nApplicant posited that her parents and parents-in-law have not been interrogated \nbecause of their age. (Tr. 38) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative goal is \na fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under the AG, the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence that transcends beyond \nnormal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in \nthose to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include \nconsideration of the possible risk the applicant may fail to safeguard such information. \nThe denial of a security clearance is in no way suggestive that an applicant is anything \nless than a loyal citizen. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUnder the AG, foreign contact and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create \ncircumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in a way inconsistent with U. S. interests or \notherwise be made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAssessment of foreign contact and interests should consider the country (China) in \nwhich the foreign contact or interest is included.  \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nThe AG lists nine available disqualifying conditions. Given that Applicant has \nmultiple members of his family who are Chinese nationals living in China, I find the \nfollowing apply:  \n \n\u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country, if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, \nand  \n \n\u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \n \nUnder \u00b6 8, two mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n  \n\u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n\u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n \nAs a threshold issue, I note that China has an authoritarian government \ndominated by its Communist Party. It is the world\u2019s most active and aggressive \nperpetrator of economic espionage, particularly with regard to its pursuit of sensitive and \nprotected U.S. technology and both U.S. military and economic intelligence. It is known \nto specifically target the United States with its intelligence-gathering programs. Both its \ngovernment and private entities within its borders are known to exploit Chinese citizens \nand those with family ties to China in order to gain access to trade secrets and other \nprotected information of U.S. origin. Human rights violations and suppression of \nreligious freedom is common. China is known to monitor various forms of \ncommunication, including those made via the Internet. Consequently, heightened \nscrutiny is warranted in this matter.  \n \n \nApplicant is clearly and naturally a caring daughter, sister, and daughter-in-law. \nRegular communication is maintained with her family in China, and annual visits are \nmade. What heightens interest in these relationships is that they involve citizens and \nresidents of China, where aggressive economic espionage and exploitation of its own \n\n \n \n6 \n \ncitizens is well documented. Indeed, Applicant\u2019s own testimony emphasizes the \nconcerns Chinese oversight has on its citizenry, and how her husband\u2019s work has \nsingled out their family in the past. With Applicant\u2019s siblings advised by Chinese officials \nto observe and report on Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s activities; Applicant and her family\u2019s \npast interest to the Chinese state; and the fears shared by her family and relations \nabroad - \u201cstaying under the radar\u201d represents little assurance that, at present, Applicant \nwill not or could not be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of \nthese kin and those of the United States. These conditions obviate application of \u00b6 8(a). \n \n \nApplicant presents a strong case tethering her life in and commitment to the \nUnited States. There is no question that her loyalty is to this country, and that she \nretains no sense of loyalty to China. Despite 20 years in the United States, and a \nlifetime raising her family, becoming a part of her church and community, and living her \ndream, certain factors cannot be overlooked. She is clearly devoted to her aged \nparents, parents-in-law, and sister in China. They maintain regular telephonic and \nelectronic contact, and Applicant and her husband visit China annually. They do so in \nfull knowledge that her husband\u2019s work lifts them from the low profile they attempt to \nmaintain into a spotlight, a beam clearly proven to raise the interest of Chinese officials \nand which continues to engender fear in all involved. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s \nuntested resolve cannot, at this time, be found to be unquestionably in favor of the \nUnited States. Therefore, \u00b6 8(b) can only be found to apply in part.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed in the AG. The ultimate determination of whether \nto grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I incorporated my comments under \nthe guideline at issue in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors related to the \nwhole person concept have already been discussed, but some warrant emphasis. \n \nApplicant is a mature, information technology professional with a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree and post post-graduate certificate. Raised in China like her husband, the two \nmarried in Europe and moved here about 20 years ago. Applicant became a U.S. citizen \nin 2010. Applicant\u2019s parents, parents-in-law, and a sister at citizens and residents of \nChina. Applicant\u2019s immediate family in China are known to Chinese officials due to her \nactivities during the Tiananmen Square upheaval, and the activities of her parents and \nparents-in-law during the Chinese Cultural Revolution which led them to suffer  \nunimaginable physical and emotional pain. Along with Applicant\u2019s in-laws and her \nhusband\u2019s siblings, they are of interest currently to Chinese officials due to her \nhusband\u2019s work, a situation that Applicant admits is the cause of considerable worry and \nlife-threatening fear. Their Christian faith also raises issues under the current Chinese \nadministration.  \n\n \n \n7 \n \nThis process is not designed to elevate those already in fear of threat by a \nforeign entity into a position where their safety, or the safety of their loved ones, is \nfurther jeopardized. The situation here poses greater risk for Applicant, her family, and \nany safeguarded information in which she may be entrusted. This is particularly true \nduring their worrisome annual trips to China, where they are made even more \nvulnerable to monitoring, threat, and manipulation. Applicant\u2019s candid and forthright \ntestimony highlights the concerns raised in this case. Foreign influence security \nconcerns remain unmitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective within the Department of \nDefense on June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 1, 2019. The case was assigned to me \non April 4, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice \nof hearing on May 1, 2019, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on May 31, \n2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted into \nevidence without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s exhibit list, discovery letter, and a \n\n \n2 \n \ncopy of a DOHA Appeal Board decision (ISCR Case No. 17-01256 (August 2018)) were \nmarked as hearing exhibits (HE) II-IV. Applicant testified and his exhibit list was marked \nas HE I. Applicant\u2019s hearing exhibits were identical to the attachments to his answer \nand, for simplicity, the markings used in the attachments are used here (Tab A-G), \nwhich I admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were marked \nas Applicant exhibits (AE) A-C and admitted without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on June 10, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in his declaration attached to his answer. \nHis admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. (Answer, Tab D) \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since 2011. He has held a security clearance since 2010. He works as a \nsecurity officer for a government agency. He has a high school diploma and earned an \ninformation technology (IT) degree in 1998. He is divorced, having been married from \n1999 to 2006. He has one son who is 18 and who Applicant still supports financially. \nApplicant served on active duty in the Army from 1990 to 1993 when he was honorably \ndischarged. He served in the Army Reserve and National Guard from 1993 to 2003. He \nwas honorably discharged after this service as well. (Tr. 17, 22-24; Answer, Tabs C-D) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax \nreturns from 2010 to 2017. He admitted in his security clearance application (SCA), his \nsecurity clearance interview, his response to interrogatories, his SOR answer, and his \nhearing testimony not timely filing his federal and state tax returns for those years. (Tr. \n17; GE 1-2; Answer, Tab D  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his tax problems to two factors. First, he blames his divorce \nin 2006, which resulted in a joint-custody arrangement for his son. Second, he claims \nthat his work schedule changed significantly in 2011 when he took his current job. He \nwas required to work 12-hour shifts at times and travel to duty locations on short notice. \nHe stated that between his job demands and taking care of his child, filing his federal \nand state income tax returns was not a priority for him. When he completed his SCA in \nMay 2016, he admitted not filing his state tax returns since 2010. He stated in the SCA \nthat he would file his returns \u201cthis year.\u201d He did not file his returns in 2016. In September \nand December 2017, he was interviewed by a defense investigator during his \nbackground check. He admitted that he had yet to file his federal and state tax returns. \nHe testified that he realized his not filing tax returns was a serious issue. Applicant hired \na CPA to prepare his tax returns and shortly thereafter filed his 2010-2017 federal and \nstate tax returns in June 2018, four months before his SOR was issued. He documented \nthat he filed his 2018 federal tax return before its due date. There is no documentation \nto support that he filed his 2016 federal return or his 2018 state return. (Tr. 18-20, 29-\n31, 32-38; Answer, Tab D; GE 1-2; AE A-C) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant documented that he uses a budget and that his finances are in order. \nHe has not received financial counseling. For all the years he did not file federal and \nstate tax returns he only owed one year of federal taxes, which he has since paid. He \npresented sworn declarations from a work supervisor, a coworker, and a personal \nfriend. All stated that Applicant is trustworthy, reliable, and possesses good judgment. \nThey recommend he retain his security clearance. (Tr. 19-21, 25; Answer, Tabs D-G)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant had unfiled federal and state tax returns from 2010 to 2017. I find both \nthe above disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant failed to make a good-faith effort to resolve his federal and state tax \nissues until after he was interviewed for his background check in September and \nDecember 2017. He even stated when completing his SCA in 2016 he would file his \nreturns that year, but he failed to do so. It is obvious that meeting his legal tax filing \nobligations was not a priority to Applicant. This pattern shows a lack of reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment for someone who served in the military and has \nworked for a federal contractor for many years. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work schedule and child care demands are no different from those of \nmillions of other working parents and are not circumstances beyond his control. \nAdditionally, once he committed to hiring a CPA in 2018 his returns were filed almost \nimmediately. He had the means to hire a professional to assist him with his taxes, but \nhe failed to do so in a timely manner. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant provided evidence that his tax problems are under control. He receives \nsome credit for eventually filing all his delinquent federal and state tax returns (although \ndocumentation is lacking for federal-2016 and state-2018). However, since it took him \nover eight years to do so, despite having the means to address his tax issues, good-\nfaith efforts to pay or resolve his tax issues are lacking. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and AG \u00b6 \n20(g) only partially apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, contractor service, and his family \ncircumstances. However, I also considered that his federal and state returns went \nunfiled from 2010 to 2017. He has not shown responsibility in exercising his lawful duty \nto file his federal and state tax returns in a timely manner.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 12, 2017. On August \n22, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F \nand Guideline E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented \nby the DOD on June 7, 2018. \nApplicant timely  answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on October 31, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on \n02/28/2019\n\n2 \n \nNovember 15, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM  and identified \nas Items 1 through 9, is admitted without objection. Applicant provided a response to the \nFORM, which was marked as AE A and entered into the record without objection.  The \ncase was assigned to me on February 14, 2019. Based on my review of the documentary \nevidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated the financial or personal conduct \nconcerns. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old program manager-engineer for a federal contractor. He \nis married and has two children. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps Active  Reserve from \n1997 to 2005 when he was honorabley discharged. (Item 4) He obtained an \nundergraduate degree in 2002, and a master\u2019s degree in 2007. He has held a security \nclearance since 2007. He has been employed with his current employer since April 2017. \n(Item 4) \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a-1.aa, a 2012 state  tax lien in the amount of $2,087;  four \nstudent loans in collection; collection accounts; charged off accounts; and car \nrepossessions for a total of 27 delinquent debts totaling approximately $230,936. (Item \n1) Applicant admitted the financial allegations listed on the SOR and provided \nexplanations. He claims that some accounts are duplicates and that he has  some debts \nthat were judgments. (Item 3) Applicant believes that his delinquent debt is about \n$173,609.43 and that the majority of the debt consists of student loans. \n \n \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts to unemployment, job instability and \ngarnishment of some of his wages for a rental car charge of about $8,000 that was \ncharged to his corporate credit card in 2016, and his lack of payments. He was \nunemployed from  June 2009 to August 2010 due to a contract ending. (Response to \nFORM) He was also unemployed from February to April 2017. (Item 5) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he owes the state tax lien in SOR 1.a, and that he will be \nestablishing a payment plan with the state to resolve the issue. (AE A) \n \n \nAs to SOR allegations for student loans 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.aa, Applicant states \nthat he has consolidated the student debt in the amount of $180,000 into $118 433, and \nthat he has started making payments on the loans. He submitted a May 2018 letter stating \nthat  he was enrolling in a rehabilitation program for the student loans, but he did not \nsubmit any documentation that he has started the program by making any payments. It \nappears from the record that a garnishment of $5,300.82 was deducted from his 2018 \npaycheck. \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (Item 4) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nAs to 1.d, 1. e, and 1.m,  all car loans, Applicant states that they have been paid \nin judgments in 2014. There is no information that any judgments have been released. It \ndoes appear in a credit report that he submitted that the allegation in 1.d was  settled for \nless than the full balance. (AE A) \n \n \nAs to 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k ,1.l, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r ,1.s, 1.v, 1.y, and 1.z, Applicant \nresponded to the FORM by stating that he will be setting up a payment plan soon. These \naccounts are on the credit reports and Applicant did not submit any evidence of  payments \nmade or payment agreements. (Answer to FORM) \n \n \nAs to 1.e, 1.j, 1.m,  and 1.t, Applicant claims that they have been resolved as they \nare no longer on his credit reports. However, the remaining SOR alleged debts appear \non the 2017 credit report submitted by Applicant as charged-off accounts or collection \naccounts. It does not reflect that any were actually paid. \n \n \nSome of the debts appear to be duplicates as Applicant explains. SOR allegation \n1.x appears to be a duplicate of 1.t; 1.w is the same as 1.o; 1.y is the same as 1.v. \nApplicant does not state that they are paid. They are either not on the credit report or he \nwill set up a payment plan. He wanted to emphasize that the total amount he allegedly \nowes is less than what the SOR states. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Personal Conduct 2.a through 2.h, an arrest in 2015 and \na charge of theft of a motor vehicle, a felony; termination of employment in 2017 for \nmisuse of a company credit card and ineligibility for rehire; unauthorized use of another \ncompany\u2019s credit card for personal expenses of in the amount of $8,000 that Applicant \ndid not reimburse; five falsifications on his 2017 security clearance application including \nnot reporting termination of employment (section 13 A and C); not listing the wronglful \nuse of a company credit card (Section 26); and  finally not listing an arrest. (Item1) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2015, and charged with theft of a motor vehicle. \nHowever, he was renting a car and presented documentation that he was released \nunconditionally from jail the following day. He did not report any details about the situation. \n \n \nApplicant denied that he was fired in 2017. He stated that he voluntarily left the \njob. He plans to repay the $8,000 charged on his corporate credit card. Applicant claims \nhe lost his comnpany  card and that a hotel charged an expense on that card  instead of \nhis personal card. \n \n \nApplicant denied the five falsifications as described above. He stated that none of \nthe actions were done purposely and that he stands ready to take responsibility for them. \nHe did not articulate a credible reason why he did not list the incidents on his 2017 security \nclearance application. \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n5 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, and failure to pay a \nstate  tax lien, and education loans that are not in repayment, along with numerous \ncollection accounts that became delinquent, establish three disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d); and 19(f) (\u201dfailure to  pay annual Federal,  state, or local income \ntax  as required.\u201d \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \n\n6 \n \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant has a 2012 state tax lien, numerous collection accounts, vehicle \nrepossessions, defaulted student loans, judgments, and wage garnishments. He stated \nthat he has made some payments and is in the process of establishing payment plans. \nHe stated that judgments were paid in 2014. He provided no documentation that a student \nloan rehabilitation plan has actually started or that he has started other promised payment \nplans. A few accounts appear to be duplicates. Applicant did not provide evidence of any \npayments other than the garnishments from the record. It it is not clear how long his pay \nhad been garnished and for which accounts. He was unemployed for a short time but he \nwas also terminated for wrongful behavior. He admitted that he owes the debts and \npromises to pay and set up plans. However, he provided no documentation to confirm his \nassertions. There is no information in the record as to his current salary. It is impossible \nto know if he is financially stable. Applicant has furnished insufficient information to meet \nhis burden. There is no record of financial counseling. None of the mitigating conditions \napply. \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n\n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of:  \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected \ninformation; (2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate \nbehavior; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4)evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources;  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \u2026; \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment; and  \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity.  \n \n\n8 \n \nApplicant has not provided a credible explanation as to why he was arrested \nfor car theft. He admitted that he put personal expenses on a company \ncredit card and gave no real reason for the actions. He denied that he was \nfired but rather left the company. However, he admitted to the $8,000 \nunauthorized charges on the corporate credit card. He denied the \nfalsifications on his security clearance application. He noted that this was \nnot purposeful. He failed to report an arrest or his credit card misuse on his \nsecurity clearance application. He knew these actions occurred recently. He \ndeliberately did not report them. Therefore, AG 16(a), (c) and (d) apply. \n \n17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and  \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \nHere, Applicant intentionally, knowingly, and willfully misreported information on \nhis 2017 security clearance application in three separate sections. He misused a \n\n9 \n \ncompany credit card and has an unexplainable arrest from 2015.  It is not the result of a \none-time mistake or an isolated incident. Although he admitted to the wrongdoing, he \nexplained that he will make amends and pay what he owes. Applicant\u2019s actions reveal \nuntrustworthy or unreliable behavior and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. He has not met his burden to mitigate the personal conduct concern. None \nof the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 2007. Her served in the U.S. Marine \nCorps receiving an honorable discharge. He has worked for a number of years as a \ncontractor. He is married and has two children.   \n \n \nThe record does not provide sufficient information as to why Applicant accrued so \nmany debts. He was unemployed for a short time. He was also terminated for wrongdoing. \nHe wants to pay his debts and promises to set up plans. He has not done anything to \nresolve his state tax lien. He has not received financial counseling. There is no evidence \nof payments or payment plans other than garnishment. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his security clearance application in five sections. \nHe misused a company credit card. He has not has mitigated the financial or personal \nconduct security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n10 \n \n. \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.aa \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant:  \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.h: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, with clarifications. Applicant\u2019s April 2017 security clearance application (Item 3), and the credit reports dated June 1, 2017 and April 17, 2018, establish the allegations. (Item 5; Item 6.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 43 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1995, and financed that education with student loans. He is unmarried, but has one minor child from a previous relationship. He has worked for his current employer, a government contractor, since January 2017. He was employed by a different government contractor from October 2013 to January 2017. He was laid off from his previous employer in October 2017. However, it is unclear from the record how long Applicant was unemployed. He also experienced a period of unemployment in March 2009 through May 2010 due to his employer closing his place of employment. (Item 3.)

He failed to provide sufficient documentation to establish \nmitigation with respect to his delinquent consumer debts and student loan. National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), implemented effective June 8, 2017.  \n02/05/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on August 25, 2018 (Answer), and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department \nCounsel submitted its file of relevant material (FORM) on September 6, 2018. Applicant \nreceived it on September 14, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 \nthrough 6. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM. Applicant submitted no response to the FORM. Items 1 through 6 are admitted \ninto the record. The case was assigned to me on January 16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, with clarifications. Applicant\u2019s \nApril 2017 security clearance application (Item 3), and the credit reports dated June 1, \n2017 and April 17, 2018, establish the allegations. (Item 5; Item 6.) After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1995, and financed \nthat education with student loans. He is unmarried, but has one minor child from a \nprevious relationship. He has worked for his current employer, a government contractor, \nsince January 2017. He was employed by a different government contractor from October \n2013 to January 2017. He was laid off from his previous employer in October 2017. \nHowever, it is unclear from the record how long Applicant was unemployed. He also \nexperienced a period of unemployment in March 2009 through May 2010 due to his \nemployer closing his place of employment. (Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a delinquent student-loan account in the amount of \n$18,266, as stated in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant attributed his inability to resolve this debt to \nhis layoff. Applicant\u2019s August 2018 credit report reflects Applicant made a $719 payment \non this account in February 2018, but that no further payments had been made through \nAugust 2018, despite being employed during that time. This debt is unresolved. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $529, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant identified this debt as a credit-card account on his security clearance \napplication. This debt has been delinquent since May 2017. He explained that he was \nliving \u201cpaycheck to paycheck\u201d and planned to resolve the debt \u201cas [he] just got a good \njob.\u201d (Item 3.) In his Answer, he asserted this debt \u201chas fallen off [his] credit report.\u201d It \ndoes not appear on his August 2018 credit report. However, he failed to resolve the debt \nin a responsible manner. (Answer; Item 3; Item 5.) \n \nApplicant is indebted on a delinquent child-support account in the amount of $206, \nas stated in SOR \u00b6 1.c. On his security clearance application, Applicant explained that he \nfell in arrears on his child-support obligation when unemployed in 2009 to 2010. He \nindicated he was resolving the arrears through payments of $84 per month. The August \n2018 credit report that accompanied his Answer reflected Applicant made regular \npayments on this debt from August 2016 through July 2018. Applicant is resolving this \ndebt. (Answer; Item 3.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was indebted on a collection account in the amount of $66, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. This debt was incurred after Applicant moved out of an apartment he \npreviously leased. Applicant\u2019s August 2018 credit report reflects this debt is \u201cpaid, closed.\u201d \nIt is resolved. (Answer; Item 3.) \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $280, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. This debt became delinquent in 2016. On his security clearance application, \nApplicant explained that this was for a cell phone bill that he incurred when he \u201cswitched \nlines.\u201d (Item 3.) He indicated he attended to resolve this account. However, it remains \nunresolved. (Item 5.) \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $198, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. This debt has been delinquent since 2011. On his security clearance \napplication, Applicant explained that he fell into arrears on this cable bill, but planned to \npay it off soon. In his Answer, Applicant explained that this debt \u201cdropped off\u201d his credit \nreport. It is unresolved. (Answer; Item 3; Item 5.) \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $174, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. This debt was for another delinquent phone bill. It was placed for collections \nin 2015. Applicant\u2019s August 2018 credit report reflects this debt remains past due. \n(Answer.) It is unresolved. \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under the financial considerations guideline is set out in AG \n 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated approximately $20,000 in delinquent debt. His debts \nbecame delinquent between 2009 and present. Despite being fully employed since 2017, \nhe has taken little action to address the majority of liabilities. There is sufficient evidence \nto establish disqualification under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has been unable to meet all of his financial obligations. There is no \nevidence that he will be able to avoid delinquent accounts in the future, despite obtaining \na higher-paying job in 2017. He remains indebted on his student loans and several \nconsumer accounts. His debt is ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant \nattributed \nhis \nfinancial \nproblems \nto \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment. These were circumstances beyond his control. However, he failed to \nprovide evidence that he addressed his remaining delinquent accounts in a reasonable \nand responsible manner once he was hired by his present employer at a higher income. \nHe is credited with his payments on his child-support obligation, a $719 payment on his \nstudent loan, and with the resolution of his $66 collection account. However, his failure to \ncontinue to make payments on his largest debt, the student loan, suggests that he is not \n\n \n6 \n \n \nacting responsibly under the circumstances. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully \nestablished.  \n \n \nApplicant provided no documentation of financial counseling. The record lacks \nevidence to suggest that his financial problems are under control, as there is no evidence \nof a payment on his largest debt since February 2018 and four other debts remain \nunresolved. While he has documented payments on his child-support arrearage and one \nconsumer debt, the evidence does not establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d).  \n \n \nApplicant did not claim to dispute any of his alleged delinquencies. He admitted all \nof the allegations on the SOR, despite noting that some of his debts no longer appear on \nhis credit report due to the passage of time. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is credited with his \npayments on his student loan and one consumer debt. However, he failed to present \nevidence of a developed track record of repayment. He may be eligible for national \nsecurity eligibility in the future if he is able to document reasonable and responsible \nactions to maintain solvency. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F.  \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 56-year-old senior project manager who has worked in the same capacity for the past decade. He completed high school and attended some college- level courses. Applicant is married with one child, aged 20. He has not served in the U.S. military. In February 2015, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13. It covered approximately $700,000 in debt. (Tr. 21) This route was initiated as a way to save his home and to lighten Applicant\u2019s stress after suffering a heart attack. Despite the bankruptcy protection, he could not make the monthly payments on the plan and he fell about $33,000 behind on monthly bankruptcy payments. He ultimately decided to terminate the bankruptcy, sell the house, move to a smaller apartment, and then make progress on some of the debts with excess proceeds from the house sale. His bankruptcy petition was dismissed in August 2015.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. On \nOctober 22, 2018, he addressed all allegations and requested a hearing before a \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned \nthe case on May 15, 2019.  \n \nA notice of hearing was issued on June 5, 2019, setting the hearing for June 12, \n2019. Applicant waived his right to 15 days notice of the hearing in order to proceed \ndirectly. The hearing was convened as scheduled, during which time the Government \noffered six exhibits (Exs.), marked as Exs. 1-6. Applicant gave testimony and was given \nuntil June 30, 2019, to submit any materials. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June \n20, 2019. On June 30, 2019, Applicant offered four documents, which were accepted \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nwithout objection as Exs. A-D.  Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a \nwhole, I find Applicant mitigated security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior project manager who has worked in the same \ncapacity for the past decade. He completed high school and attended some college-\nlevel courses. Applicant is married with one child, aged 20. He has not served in the \nU.S. military.  \n \n \nIn February 2015, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13. It \ncovered approximately $700,000 in debt. (Tr. 21) This route was initiated as a way to \nsave his home and to lighten Applicant\u2019s stress after suffering a heart attack. Despite \nthe bankruptcy protection, he could not make the monthly payments on the plan and he \nfell about $33,000 behind on monthly bankruptcy payments. He ultimately decided to \nterminate the bankruptcy, sell the house, move to a smaller apartment, and then make \nprogress on some of the debts with excess proceeds from the house sale. His \nbankruptcy petition was dismissed in August 2015. (Tr. 22) \n \n \nAs a result of the bankruptcy dismissal, Applicant remained indebted to several \nother creditors noted in the SOR at the following allegations: \n \n \n1.b.i-iii - Three timeshare balances ($5,142, $11,300, $14,486) \u2013 Applicant provided \na copy of his current Experian credit report indicating that the account at allegation \n1.b.iii ($14,486) was charged off in 2018. No indication of the balance at that time is \nreflected; he was only told there was no longer any outstanding debt for him to \naddress. He last spoke with the three entities about their statuses about a month \nafter the SOR was issued. (Tr. 29) He was again informed no outstanding debt was \nowed. Neither of the other two timeshare accounts are represented in the credit \nreport, although he stated they were similarly charged off. (Ex. D at 9; Tr. 28-30) \n \n1.b.iv \u2013 This account was for an insurance policy Applicant stated he terminated. (Tr. \n32) The balance at issue is for $2,377. He testified that he was given a refund check \nafter the account was closed, but no documentary evidence regarding either the \naccount closure or the refund could be located before the record closed.  \n \n1.b.v \u2013 This is for a disputed debt regarding damage to a rental car. (Tr. 33) Since \nApplicant failed to provide the company with his insurance information, it sought an \nadverse judgment against him for $13,999. Applicant has paid nothing on this debt. \n(Tr. 34) Although Applicant provided no documentation reflecting he disputed the \ndebt, he said he continues to dispute this debt. \n   \nApplicant owed a $41,000 tax debt to the federal government (IRS). That debt \noriginally represented combined taxes owed for Applicant and his wife for the period of \n2007-2008. At the time, both spouses were W-2 employees and she had not been \nhaving sufficient money withheld from her paychecks to cover her portion of their tax \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nliability. (Tr. 15) Applicant is unsure if they were filing jointly before 2008. However, \nwhen it came time to pay their income taxes, they did not have enough cash reserves to \ndo so. The couple ultimately entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS in early \n2018. (Ex. 3; Tr. 16-17)  \n \nThat agreement has since had other tax year obligations added to its total \noutstanding balance, such as $1,000 owed for tax year 2018, $12,000 for tax year 2015, \n$2,000 for tax year 2014, and $3,900 for tax year 2013. (Tr. 13-15) Payments on the \nplan started in February 2018 at $400 a month and rose to $500 a month in April 2019. \nMeanwhile, he requested that his tax liability for tax years 2007, 2008, and 2009, or any \nfederal tax liability over 10 years old, be dropped. (Tr. 13) They have made progress \nreducing this debt. (Tr. 12-13; Ex. B) The balance now owed to the IRS was shown to \nnow be $26,970 for balances owed for tax years 2017, 2015-2012, and 2010. (Ex. B) \n \nAlso at issue is a 2017 state tax liability for approximately $960. He has a \nfinancial arrangement to pay off that balance through monthly payments of $50. He \ninitiated that plan at the beginning of 2019 with an initial payment of $300 or $400. (Tr. \n19-20) (Ex. C) The remaining balance owed is $431.33. (Ex. C; Tr. 20)] \n \nToday, Applicant is living within his means. He has a total monthly net income of \nabout $9,591, with a monthly net remainder of about $2,100. (Ex. A) He is generally \npaying more than the minimum balances on his debts, where applicable (i.e. IRS, state, \ncar loan, credit card). He has made reasonable reductions in living expenses, \nconsolidated their needs for vehicles down to only having one car, and focused on \nsaving. Applicant plans to continue paying off the rest of his debt and, to ameliorate the \nheavy financial burden of renting a home by buying a condo in July 2010. He feels he is \nnow financially on \u201cthe right path.\u201d (Tr. 37) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \n\n \n \n \n \n4\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad numerous delinquent debts, an adverse judgment, and outstanding tax obligations. \nThis is sufficient to invoke financial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do \nso;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control, and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s heart attack protracted his acquisition of debt and delinquent debt. It \nseems to be what prompted him to initially file for bankruptcy before the SOR was \nissued. In filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, he chose a legitimate avenue for protection. \nHowever, the monthly payments were too high and unmanageable. He abandoned that \nmethod and, instead, sold his house, reduced his expenses, and used excess profits \nfrom his home sale to begin addressing his the debts at issue.  \n \nOf his three timeshares, Applicant showed that he has disposed of the most \nexpensive unit, which represented about half of the debt those timeshares represented. \nRegarding that particular unit, he was told no outstanding debt was owed. He was told \nthe same thing with regard to the other two timeshares, although he offered no \ndocumentation showing they had similarly been charged-off.  \n \nApplicant also initiated a repayment plan with the IRS which incorporated all \nfederal income taxes owed over multiple years, the balance of which he has reduced \nfrom over $41,000 to about $27,000. He continues making payments on that plan and \nhas the resources to do so. Similarly, he has reduced his state tax obligation by more \nthan half, from $960 to $431. He will continue to investigate the situation with the rental \ncar judgment and dispute his responsibility for the debt while locating documentation \nreflecting his insurance plan refund. Taken together, his efforts demonstrate that he is \nearnestly addressing all of his debts with sufficient success to raise AG \u00b6 20(d). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the her  \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those \nfactors. I am also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ngrant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased on careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n     \nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior project manager who has worked in the same \ncapacity for the 10 years. He has attended some college course, is married, and has \none grown child. He suffered from a heart attack in late 2014 or early 2015 which led \nhim simplify his life and address his financial issues. His initial method of choice was \nChapter 13 bankruptcy, but the monthly payments were too unwieldy and unrealistic. \n \nUltimately, Applicant decided to downsize and sell his house. The proceeds from \nthat sale have helped fund his more recent repayment measures, while his downsizing \nhas added comfortably to his coffers. He showed one of his three timeshares has been \ncharged-off and been told there is nothing more for him to pay toward that debt. He \nstarted addressing his debts to the IRS before receiving the SOR. They have since \nbeen consolidated, a reasonable repayment plan has been initiated, and he has made \nmeasurable progress in reducing that balance. He has thus far similarly paid more than \nhalf of his debt balance to his state.    \n \nThis process does not demand that an applicant pay all of one\u2019s delinquent \ndebts. It does, however, expect an applicant to describe a workable and manageable \nplan for addressing his debts and to present documentary evidence that such a scheme \nhas successfully been implemented. While there is more to be done toward completely \nsatisfying his debts, Applicant demonstrated that he now has both the income, the \nmotivation, and the ability to pay off these obligations and fulfill his dream of owning a \nnew home. I find that Applicant has mitigated financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \n                                                     Administrative Judge \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Her request for continued security \nclearance eligibility is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 2, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nher employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense (DOD) could not determine that \n03/18/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security \nclearance.1 \n \n \nOn September 13, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and \nrequested a hearing.  \n \n \nI received the case on November 8, 2018, and convened the requested hearing \non, December 13, 2018. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel \nproffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 8. Applicant testified and proffered 37 documents \ncollectively as Applicant Exhibit (AX) A. All exhibits were admitted, although Applicant \nobjected to GX 2 \u2013 4 on grounds that the information was old or required updating. For \nreasons stated at the hearing,2 I overruled her objections and admitted those exhibits \nalong with all other exhibits to which there were no objections. I received a transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on January 2, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant failed to timely file her \nfederal income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2016 (SOR 1.a) and her state \nincome tax returns for the tax years 2014 through 2016 (SOR 1.e).

(Answer) In addition to the \nfacts thus established, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. Since February 2017, she has worked as a technical \nwriter for a defense contractor. In May 2000, Applicant graduated from college with a \ndegree in mathematics. While in college, she amassed an impressive academic record \nthat led to an internship with a large information technology company. She also is a \nmember of a prestigious engineering society. After graduating, she worked until 2004 for \nanother large technology firm, but none of her work was related to the defense industry. \nThis is her first request for a security clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 6 \u2013 7, 15 \u2013 16) \n \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n \n2 Tr. 22 \u2013 31. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant and her husband, a software engineer, have been married since March \n2003. They have two children, now ages 12 and 14. In 2004, when their older child was \nborn, Applicant left the workforce to raise their children as a stay-at-home mother. Aside \nfrom a brief foray into self-employment in a childcare-related business, Applicant did not \nearn income between 2004 and 2017, and self-employment did not result in reportable \nincome. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; AX A; Tr. 16, 44 \u2013 45, 54) \n \n \nApplicant and her husband lived in State A until March 2016. They still own the \nhouse they lived in there, and they have been trying unsuccessfully to sell it since moving \nto State B. The housing market where they lived in State B is still depressed. They moved \nto State B after Applicant\u2019s husband, who had been unemployed since October 2015, \nfound work in State B. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; AX A; Tr. 45, 50) \n \n \nWhile Applicant was raising their children, she relied on her husband to manage \ntheir finances. This included filing and paying their state and federal income taxes. Their \nfinances began to suffer after he lost his job in 2015. Additionally, they had been the \nprimary caregiver for Applicant\u2019s mother after she was diagnosed with a terminal illness \nin 2007 until her death in 2012. Not only did this result in additional medical and other \nexpenses, it disrupted and stressed their home life. Also, in 2011, the mortgage for \nApplicant\u2019s house in State A increased unexpectedly. Applicant and her husband \nobtained a mortgage modification the following year after struggling to make their new \npayments. Their mortgage is again in good standing. Through a combination of household \nstress over their debts and lack of income, and an erroneous assumption that they did \nnot have to file income tax returns when they were not bringing in any income, Applicant\u2019s \nhusband did not file their federal income tax returns as alleged in SOR 1.a or their state \nincome tax returns as alleged in SOR 1.e. Applicant\u2019s husband submitted a letter attesting \nto his failure to file their returns as required. As it turns out, they were correct as to their \nState A returns for 2016, because they spent most of that tax year in State B. (Answer; \nGX 1; GX 2; GX 8; AX A; Tr. 16 \u2013 20, 46 \u2013 48) \n \n \nIn her e-QIP, Applicant disclosed in great detail her tax and other financial \ndifficulties. Shortly thereafter, she began the process of filing her past-due returns and \npaying her taxes and other debts. To date, Applicant has paid the debts at SOR 1.h \u2013 1.j. \nShe also has filed all of her tax returns. Available information shows she has established \na repayment plan for her federal taxes, through which she has paid $300 each month \nsince August 2018. As for her state taxes, her State A debt has been reduced by about \n40 percent from $11,271 to $6,683. She also has established, and is adhering to a \nrepayment plan for her State B taxes that will resolve that debt by 2021. (GX 1; GX 2; GX \n5 \u2013 7; AX A; Tr. 36 \u2013 43) \n \n \nApplicant took over management of the household finances in early 2017. In \naddition to her efforts to file past-due tax returns and repay their taxes, she obtained from \nher husband a limited power of attorney in order to access his tax records and other \nfinancial information; she sought assistance from a financial counseling firm; and she \nused the services of a certified public accountant in resolving their tax status. Currently, \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant and her husband are sound financially. They have been able to stay current on \ntheir State A mortgage while paying the debts listed in the SOR. They currently earn about \n$180,000 annually combined. Their cash on hand each month after paying their debts \nand other regular obligations is sufficient to guard against unexpected events. (Answer; \nAX A; Tr. 38, 48 \u2013 55, 58) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,3 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) \nof the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.6 A person who has access \n                                                 \n3 See Directive. 6.3. \n \n4 The current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, \n2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based \non trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the Government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established Applicant failed to file her state and federal income \ntax returns as required, and that she incurred the delinquent tax and other debts alleged \nin the SOR. That information reasonably raised a security concern about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nMore specifically, available information supported application of the disqualifying \nconditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired). \n \nBy contrast, Applicant established that her debts arose from events and \ncircumstances beyond her control that are not likely to recur. Applicant and her husband \nendured a combination of reduced income and unexpected expenses before moving to \nState B in 2016. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s husband did not file their tax returns as required. \nNonetheless, Applicant acted in a responsible manner under the circumstances. She now \nmanages their household finances and has documented significant progress in resolving \ntheir tax and other debts. All of their returns are now filed, and she has established a \n                                                 \n7 See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nreliable track record of repayment. She also has resolved her smaller, non-tax debts and \nhas sufficient funds remaining each month with which to avoid any future financial \nadversity. Finally, Applicant has not incurred any new delinquencies, and the record does \nnot show that her financial problems were caused by poor decision making, irresponsible \nspending, or misconduct on her part. \n \nAll of the foregoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude the record as a whole is sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the Government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s finances. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Particularly noteworthy is the information regarding Applicant\u2019s response to \nadverse financial circumstances. It reflects well on Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. A \nfair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole shows the security \nconcerns about his finances are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since 2015. He seeks to retain a security clearance. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 2003. He has never married, and he has no children.1 Applicant was involved in several alcohol-related criminal incidents.

Hackett, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the personal conduct, alcohol consumption, and \ncriminal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines E (personal \nconduct), G (alcohol consumption), and J (criminal conduct). Applicant responded to the \nSOR on August 14, 2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nThe case was assigned to me on November 1, 2018. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 19, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for December 14, 2018. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, called three witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection.  \n01/10/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2015. He seeks to retain a security clearance. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 2003. He has never married, and he has no \nchildren.1 \n \n \nApplicant was involved in several alcohol-related criminal incidents. He was cited \nin 1998 for minor in possession of alcohol. He was 18 years old at the time. He pleaded \nguilty and paid a fine. Applicant testified that he was at a party when the police arrived. \nHe stated that he was not drinking, but there was alcohol at the party. He pleaded guilty \nbecause his parents told him to accept responsibility.2 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2008 and charged with driving while impaired by \nalcohol (DWI). He pleaded guilty and received probation before judgment for one year \nand a $500 fine. The charge was dismissed after he successfully completed the terms \nof his probation.3 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he had two beers with dinner over the course of about two \nto three hours. He thought that he was fine to drive. He stated that he did well on the \nfield sobriety test, but there was a malfunction with the breathalyzer, so there were no \nblood alcohol concentration (BAC) results. He followed his attorney\u2019s advice and \naccepted the guilty plea and probation before judgment with the knowledge that the \ncharge would be dismissed if he completed the terms of the probation.4 \n \n \nApplicant submitted Questionnaires for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \n2009 and 2014. He reported the above two incidents in both SF 86s. He wrote that a \nDUI \u201cwill not happen again.\u201d5 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in May 2017 and charged with driving under the influence \nof alcohol (DUI). In November 2017, he pleaded guilty to DWI, and the DUI charge was \ndismissed. He was sentenced to 60 days in the county detention center, with all 60 days \nsuspended, and supervised probation for 18 months. As part of his probation, he was \nordered to attend a victim impact panel. His state required him to install an interlock \nsystem on his car\u2019s ignition for one year, which he successfully completed without any \nviolations. He will remain on probation until May 2019.6 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 38, 45-46, 71-72; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n2 Tr. at 46-48, 62-63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE D. \n \n3 Tr. at 48-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4; AE D. \n \n4 Tr. at 48-51, 61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE D.  \n \n5 Tr. at 63; GE 1, 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 51-56, 65-66; GE 5, 6; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B-D. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he went to dinner with a friend, and he had two large shots \nof tequila over the course of a long evening. He again felt that he was fine to drive. He \nwas stopped after making a right turn while at a red light. He stated that he did not see \nthat there was a no turn on red sign. He believes he passed the field sobriety test, but \nhe refused to take a breathalyzer. He testified that he had friends who were lawyers \nwho advised him that if he was ever stopped by the police, he should refuse the \nbreathalyzer.7 \n \n \nApplicant attended and completed alcohol counseling from June 2017 to \nNovember 2017. He completed 26 sessions, which included group and individual \nsessions. His counselor, a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), reported that \nApplicant showed marked improvement throughout the course of treatment, and that \nApplicant \u201cshowed sincere remorse and shame about the fact that he did not learn from \nhis first offense which led to his second arrest.8 The LCSW concluded: \n \nAs with any human behavior, no one person has a crystal ball. The best \nwe can do is look for sustained improvement in behavior and judgment. It \nis in my professional opinion that [Applicant] not only successfully \ncompleted treatment but went on to demonstrate to me that he has \nlearned from his mistakes and genuinely expresses sincere motivation to \ncontinue in his commitment to sobriety.9 \n \n \nApplicant informed his supervisor at work that he was arrested for DUI. Applicant \ntestified that he benefited greatly from the counseling. He decided to completely abstain \nfrom alcohol. He has not had a drink since January 2018. He assures that he has \nlearned from his mistakes, and the conduct will not be repeated.10 \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded, as reported by three witnesses. He is praised for his \nexcellent job performance, trustworthiness, responsibility, work ethic, and integrity. The \nwitnesses recommended that he retain his security clearance11 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 51-55, 64-65; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE D. \n \n8 Tr. at 56-58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE D. \n \n9 AE D. \n \n10 Tr. at 24, 56-60, 66-71; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6; AE D. \n \n11 Tr. at 14-44. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder.  \n \nApplicant was cited in 1998 for minor in possession of alcohol, and he had two \nalcohol-related driving offenses. AG \u00b6 22(a) is applicable.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \n \nApplicant completed alcohol counseling in 2017. His LCSW opined that Applicant \nsuccessfully completed treatment, learned from his mistakes, and expressed sincere \nmotivation to continue in his commitment to sobriety. Applicant has abstained from \nalcohol since January 2018. He assures that he has learned from his mistakes, and the \nconduct will not be repeated. \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant appears to be sincere, but I believe he was also sincere in 2009 and \n2014 when he wrote that a DUI \u201cwill not happen again.\u201d He remains on probation until \nMay 2019. I find that Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) is not applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n23(b) and 23(d) have some applicability, but they are insufficient to overcome concerns \nabout his alcohol-related criminal conduct.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two alcohol-related driving offenses were cross-alleged under \ncriminal conduct. He will be on probation until May 2019. The above disqualifying \nconditions are applicable.  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant has a strong work record and favorable character evidence. However, \nhe is still on probation for his most recent offense. I have unmitigated concerns under \nthe same rationale discussed in the alcohol consumption analysis. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal conduct is cross-alleged under Guideline E. \nThat conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s \nconduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct guidelines. However, the general concerns about questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15 and 16(c) are established.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n8 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant informed his supervisor at work that he was arrested for DUI. That \neliminated his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 17(e) is \napplicable. However, concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment \nremain. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated under the same rationale \ndiscussed in the alcohol consumption analysis. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, G, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nexcellent character evidence, but he has two alcohol-related driving offenses, and he \nremains on probation until May 2019. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct, alcohol consumption, and criminal conduct security \nconcerns.  \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After reviewing the \ncompleted background investigation, adjudicators at the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine that it was clearly \n1 Applicant\u2019s name is misspelled on the Statement of Reasons. \n02/06/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nconsistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified \ninformation.2 \n \nOn June 8, 2018, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Applicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a decision without \na hearing.  \n \nOn September 5, 2018, Department Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM)3 in support of the SOR. \nApplicant received the FORM on September 20, 2018. The record closed on November \n9, 2018, after Applicant timely responded to the FORM (Response). I received this case \nfor decision on January 30, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owes the federal \ngovernment $58,490, a debt that is being enforced through a tax lien filed against him in \n2007 (SOR 1.a). In response to the SOR, Applicant denied that he was subject to a federal \ntax lien.4 (FORM, Item 1) \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. After graduating from college in June 2002, he was hired \nin October 2002 as an engineer by a federal contractor. He still works for that company, \nand he first received a security clearance in August 2006. (FORM, Item 2) \n \n \nIn July 2000, Applicant bought a house. In May 2012, he gifted an interest in that \nhouse to his parents. All three persons have since owned that property in joint tenancy. \n(FORM, Item 1; Response) \n \n \nIn September 2003, the IRS filed a lien against Applicant\u2019s parents to enforce a \n$58,462.25 debt for unpaid taxes between 1997 and 1999. The lien was released in \nOctober 2012. (FORM, Items 1, 4, and 5) \n \n \nA credit report obtained by investigators in February 2017 shows a tax lien filed in \nMay 2007 that is attributed only to Applicant. A tax record obtained in August 2018 shows \na tax lien filed in May 2007 that is attributed to both Applicant and his parents. Both \nrecords show a lien for an amount that is $27.75 more than the 2003 lien against \nApplicant\u2019s parents. The lien also carries a different filing number from the satisfied tax \nlien against Applicant\u2019s parents.

In the FORM, Department Counsel relies on five enclosed exhibits (Items \n1 \u2013 5). \n4 His denial renders SOR 1.a as a controverted issue of fact and requires the Government to produce \nsufficient reliable information to support the allegation. See Directive, Section E3.1.14. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOn October 10, 2018, the attorney for Applicant\u2019s parents5 wrote to the IRS to \ncontest both the lien and its entry on Applicant\u2019s credit history. In that letter, he averred \nthat in 2003, when the lien was obtained against Applicant\u2019s parents, they did not have \nany assets to which the lien could attach. He further opined that Applicant\u2019s name was \nincluded in the lien in June 2012 after he and his parents became joint owners of the \nhouse he gifted to them. Because Applicant\u2019s name was also on the title as a joint tenant \nat that time, Applicant also became a subject of the lien. (Response) \n \n \nAt some point before receiving an interest in Applicant\u2019s house, his parents had \narranged with the IRS to repay their tax debt. As part of that agreement, the IRS advised \nthem the lien would be renewed periodically to protect the IRS\u2019 interest until the lien was \nsatisfied. Applicant\u2019s counsel argues that the May 2007 filing date represented only a \nrenewal of the 2003 lien by the IRS against Applicant\u2019s parents, and that it was not the \ndate Applicant\u2019s name was added to the lien. Further, a renewal four years after the lien \nwas first filed might explain the different filing number and slightly different amount of debt \nthat was the subject of the lien. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s position is that in June 2012, \nwhen he gifted an interest in his house to his parents while the lien was still active, the \nIRS attached the lien to the house and its owners, and that there is only one lien at issue \nhere. As of November 9, 2018, the IRS had not responded to Applicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s \nOctober 10, 2018 letter. (FORM, Items 3 \u2013 5; Response) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation of this matter is plausible. The record does not contain any \ninformation that clearly establishes the presence of another tax lien against Applicant that \nis still unresolved. The differences between the details of the release of lien order provided \nby Applicant and the information about the lien presented in the FORM are minor. Without \nadditional information showing how Applicant incurred his own tax debt, those differences \nare inconsequential. Based on all of the foregoing, I find as fact that the only tax lien at \nissue in this case was the lien originally filed against Applicant\u2019s parents in 2003 and \nresolved in 2012. Further, the tax lien filed in May 2007 was the same lien and was \nattributed to Applicant only through operation of the joint home ownership with his \nparents, and not because of any failure by Applicant to file or pay his taxes.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,6 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the \nnew guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are: \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n                                                 \n5 Their attorney is also representing Applicant in this matter. \n6 See Directive, 6.3. \n\n \n4 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest7 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. Department Counsel must produce sufficient reliable \ninformation on which DOD based its preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security \nclearance for an applicant. Additionally, Department Counsel must prove controverted \nfacts alleged in the SOR.8 If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant \nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the case for disqualification.9 \n \n  \nBecause no one is entitled to a security clearance, applicants bear a heavy burden \nof persuasion to establish that it is clearly consistent with the national interest for them to \nhave access to protected information. A person who has access to such information \nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. \nThus, there is a compelling need to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will protect the nation\u2019s interests as \nhis or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation in favor of the Government.10 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe DOD CAF\u2019s information provided a good-faith basis for the allegation that \nApplicant owed $58,490 for a federal tax lien filed in 2007. Such information reasonably \nraises the security concern expressed at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n                                                 \n7 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n8 See Directive, E3.1.14. \n9 See Directive, E3.1.15. \n10 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n\n \n5 \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nInformation presented in support of the SOR requires consideration of the \ndisqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations); and 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required). If uncontroverted, the Government\u2019s information would show that \nApplicant failed to pay federal income, property, or business taxes sometime before 2007, \nand that as of June 2018, he had not paid or otherwise resolved a tax debt being enforced \nthrough a federal tax lien. \n \nApplicant denied the single allegation in this case, thus keeping the burden on the \nGovernment to produce sufficient information to prove the facts alleged. Applicant also \nproffered a copy of his parents\u2019 release of the 2003 tax lien. The Government\u2019s exhibits \nreflected both a lien attributed only to Applicant and a lien attributed to Applicant and his \nparents. All of the available information probative of Applicant\u2019s responsibility for unpaid \ntaxes shows that the lien at issue in SOR 1.a, while it included Applicant\u2019s name, was not \nthe result of any failure by Applicant to file or pay taxes.  \n \nDepartment Counsel argued in the FORM that the information Applicant provided \nwith his SOR response did not meet his burden of refuting or mitigating the security \nconcerns raised by the Government\u2019s information. Nonetheless, in response to the \nFORM, Applicant presented sufficient information to establish that the lien in question \nwas his parents\u2019 responsibility; that the lien has been satisfied; and that it has been \nerroneously attributed to Applicant in his credit history. In short, the record evidence as a \nwhole refutes SOR 1.a as the basis for application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), or 19(f). \n \nIn the alternative, even if I concluded that Applicant was responsible for the tax \nlien, it has been resolved for more than six years. Accordingly, the record also supports \napplication of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe record does not contain any other adverse information about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances. On balance, Applicant presented sufficient information to refute the single \nallegation against him, as well as to mitigate the security concerns raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s information. \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in context \nof the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The record evidence as a whole shows \nthat the doubts raised by the DOD CAF\u2019s information have been resolved, and it supports \na fair and commonsense conclusion in favor of Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all available information, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor continued security clearance eligibility is granted. \n \n \n \n                                             \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Henderson, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nJanuary 28, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStatement of Case \n \nOn June 13, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 17, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on August 27, 2018.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 15, \n2018, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 3, 2018. The \nGovernment offered four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, \n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered one exhibit at the hearing, \nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A.  Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 11, 2018. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 46 years old.  He is married a second time and has two step-\nchildren, and three biological children from a previous marriage.  He has an Associate\u2019s \nDegree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Logistics Analyst and is seeking \nto obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nApplicant served for twenty years on active duty in the United States Navy.  He \nretired honorably as an E-5 in 2011.   \n \nApplicant states that he became delinquently indebted while in the military.  He \nseparated from his first wife in 2005.  After their divorce, Applicant\u2019s debt accumulated \nas he had the responsibility to take care of two households, including his ex-wife and \ntheir three children, as well as himself.  Applicant testified that he was stationed \noverseas at the time, and he was simply trying to make ends meet.  To assist him with \nthis financial responsibility, he took out a loan with Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, \nbut he never obtained any financial counseling, budgets, or any other services that \ncould have possibly helped him with this financial situation.  After retiring from the Navy \nin 2011, Applicant found it difficult adjusting to the civilian salary which was substantially \nless than what he had been making in the military.  Although he received a military \npension, his pension and his civilian salary together was still less than what he had \nearned in the military.  (Tr. pp. 37 -38.)  As a result, he became delinquently indebted to \nthe following creditors.   \n \nThe SOR identified fourteen debts under this guideline, totaling in excess of \n$51,000.  In his answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth under this \nguideline.  Applicant began working for his current employer in 2015, and has been \ntrying to remedy his financial indebtedness since then.  Credit Reports of the Applicant \ndated January 5, 2018, and August 19, 2018, confirm each of the debts listed in the \nSOR.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)  \n \n1.a.  A debt owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $24,747.  This is for a car that Applicant leased that had \nexcessive mileage.  The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 24.)     \n \n\n \n3 \n \n1.b.  A debt owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $7,678.  This is a personal loan that Applicant took out.  The \ndebt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 25.)  \n \n1.c. A debt owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $4,303.  The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 26.)   \n \n \n1.d.  A debt owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $3,478.  The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 26.) \n \n1.e.  A debt owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $3,363.  This is a military credit card.  Applicant states that he is \ncurrently making payments toward the debt of $70 monthly through allotments.  (Tr. p. \n27.)  He has provided no supporting documentation. \n \n1.f. A debt owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $2,590.  This was a personal loan that Applicant has paid in full.  \n(Tr. p. 27, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)   \n \n \n1.g.  Applicant owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $619.  This is a personal loan. The debt remains owing.  (Tr. \np. 29.)   \n \n1.h.  A debt owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $536.  The debt remains owing.           \n \n1.i. A debt owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $1,349.  The debt is related to an apartment that Applicant \nrented.  The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 30.)    \n \n \n1.j.  A debt owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $1,276.  The debt remains owing. \n \n1.k.  A debt owed to a creditor for an account was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $676.  This is a credit card.  The debt remains owing.  (Tr. pp. \n30-31.)   \n \n1.l. A debt owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection the \napproximately amount of $300.  This is for automobile insurance.  The debt remain \nowing.  (Tr. p. 31.)     \n \n1.m.  A debt owed to a creditor for a medical account was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $210.  This is a medical bill.  The debt remains owing.  \n(Tr.p.31.)   \n \n1.n. A debt owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in the \napproximately amount of $61.  The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 31.)     \n\n \n4 \n \n \nWith his current employer, Applicant is now earning about $80,000 annually.  He \nstates that he has now gotten to the point where he is above water and can start paying \nsome of his delinquent debts off.  (Tr. p. 36.)     \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant engaged in conduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations that raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation set forth under this guideline.  He completed an \ne-QIP dated December 14, 2017.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  Section 26 asked about his \nFinancial Record, specifically, \u201cDelinquency Involving Routine Accounts Other than \nPreviously Listed.\u201d  The question asked, \u201cIn the past 7 years, have you defaulted on any \ntype of loan?\u201d  It also asked, \u201cIn the past seven years have you had bills or debts turned \nover to a collection agency?\u201d  It further asked, \u201cIn the past seven years have you had \nany account or credit card suspended, charged off or cancelled for failing to pay as \nagreed?  In the past seven years have you been over 120 days delinquent on any debt \nnot previously entered?  and, are you currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt \nnot previously entered?  Applicant responded, \u201cNO,\u201d to all four questions.  (Government \nExhibit 1.)  These were false answers.  Applicant failed to list any of the delinquent \ndebts set forth in allegations 1. a., through 1. n., of the SOR.     \n \n \n \nApplicant explained that the reason he did not list his delinquent debts on his \nsecurity clearance application is because there were \u201ca lot to list\u201d.  He knew that he was \ngoing to have to answer questions about them during his personal interview and so he \ndid not list them.  He states that he did not intent to deceive or hide anything from the \nGovernment.  (Tr. p. 32.)  \n \n  I do not find this testimony credible.  Applicant knew or should have known that \nhe should answer the questions on the security clearance application truthfully.  He \nshould have listed his delinquent debts in response to the questions in Section 26.  \nUnder the circumstances, he obviously thought that there were so many he did not want \nto be bothered.         \n  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n\n \n5 \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n6 \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant remains excessively indebted.  He states that he has paid off one of \nthe debts listed in the SOR and is making payments toward resolving another.  There is \nno evidence in the record to demonstrate that he is now financially stable, that he can \nafford his lifestyle, or that he has the financial resources available to handle his financial \nobligations.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n\n \n7 \n \n  \nTrying to maintain two households on one person\u2019s salary is difficult enough, \nespecially where child support payments are required.  This situation obviously \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties.  In addition, having to adjust from living \non a military salary to a civilian salary, operating with less income and having to pay \nmore taxes is also more financially burdensome.  In this case, Applicant encountered \nboth of these situations.  However, at this point, although he has been working full time \nfor several years, he has not yet started his monthly payments to resolve his delinquent \ndebts, and they, for the most part, remain excessive and outstanding.  At this point, it \ncannot be said that he is financially stable or that he has made a good faith effort to \nresolve his indebtedness. \n  \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:       \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.   \n \n \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified his e-QIP in response to questions regarding his \ndelinquent debts.  Applicant is a retired veteran who understands the importance of \nbeing truthful on his security clearance application.  He knew that he had a lot of \ndelinquent debts, and he deliberately failed to disclose them in response to questions \nrequiring him to do so on the e-QIP.  The Government relies on one\u2019s responses to the \nquestions on the e-QIP to determine ones trustworthiness.  If the answers are not \ntruthful, the Government is misled, and Applicant cannot be trusted.  Under the \ncircumstances, Applicant knew about his financial indebtedness and deliberately chose \nnot to list them.  He was not honest with the Government about them.  There are no \napplicable conditions that could be mitigating under AG \u00b6 17.     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant:  \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant:  \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 10, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline I, psychological conditions, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 12, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 15, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October \n01/24/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n18, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 8, 2018. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3.1 Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nA through D. There were no objections to any exhibits offered, and all were admitted into \nevidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript on November 26, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He denied the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d and 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and two master\u2019s degrees. \nHe has never married and has no children. He has worked for a federal contractor since \n2005.2  \n \n \nIn about June 2014, Applicant attempted suicide. After receiving treatment for \nphysical injuries, he was voluntarily admitted to an inpatient mental-health facility for \nevaluation and treatment. Applicant testified that he was working long hours, going to \nwork in the morning in the dark and coming home in the evening in the dark. His home \nneeded repairs and he was trying to keep his homeowners\u2019 association happy. He \ntestified that he had a multitude of stressors that were increasing. He said he turned into \na robot. He was alone, sad, and lost sight of what was important. He was dealing with \nthese emotional issues without professional help. He was performance-oriented, and that \nattitude overrode what he should have been doing, which was to take care of himself. He \nlost touch with his personal needs. He was gaunt at the time and not eating healthy foods. \nWhen be felt overwhelmed by stress, he cut his wrists. He admitted himself to the hospital \nwhere he was treated, and then voluntarily admitted himself to inpatient treatment for two \nweeks.3  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was treated by a psychiatrist after he was released from \ntreatment in 2014. He saw the psychiatrist monthly and was prescribed medication. His \ntreatment with this psychiatrist ceased in March 2015. In early 2016 Applicant was treated \nby a nurse practitioner, who was part of the psychiatrist\u2019s practice, through the middle of \n2016.4  \n \n \nWhile in treatment, Applicant was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder-\nsingle episode. He was prescribed antidepressant drugs, but had a negative reaction to \nthe first medication. It was then changed to one he could tolerate. He remained on the \nmedication until August 2016 when he was told by the nurse practitioner that he could \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is the discovery letter.  \n \n2 Tr. 15-16. \n \n3 Tr. 35-38, 44-45, 53. \n \n4 Tr. 27-31, 38-40, 45-48. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nreduce the medication based on his own determination of his needs. He no longer takes \nthis medication.5 \n \n \nIn February 2018, Applicant participated in a government-requested psychological \nevaluation conducted by a duly qualified mental health professional, a neuropsychologist. \nA series of psychological tests were conducted. He was diagnosed with major depressive \ndisorder, recurrent severe, with psychotic symptoms.6  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s prognosis by the neuropsychologist is guarded due to untreated \nsymptoms of mood disturbance and psychosis, and limited awareness of his mental \nstatus. She noted that Applicant\u2019s reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness could be \naffected by his psychiatric symptoms.7 Applicant disagreed with the diagnosis.8  \n \n \nApplicant returned to the psychiatrist who previously treated him in 2014 to 2015. \nHe wanted the psychiatrist to evaluate the government\u2019s mental health professional\u2019s \nopinion. Applicant provided a two-page medical record from the psychiatrist. The report \nprovided the following information. The last time Applicant was seen by the psychiatrist \nwas in March 2015. He said Applicant did well until July 2016, when he returned to the \npractice and was seen by a nurse practitioner. He was restarted on medication for \ndepression. He took the medication until February 2017. Applicant told the psychiatrist \nthat he was feeling better at that time and stopped psychiatric treatment. Since then \nApplicant did not have additional contact with the psychiatrist. The report stated that on \nOctober 21, 2018, Applicant came to see him because he had received an evaluation \nfrom a neuropsychologist and was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, recurrent, \nsevere with psychotic features. He told the psychiatrist that he was worried about his job. \nHe told the psychiatrist that he had done well at his job and denied issues with depression, \nsevere anxiety, paranoia, sleep disturbance or other symptoms. He further disclosed he \nhad a girlfriend of four years, and he was close with his parents. He denied any current \nstressors.9  \n \n \nThe medical report further stated that the psychiatrist reviewed the government \nneuropsychologist\u2019s opinion. He stated that he did not doubt the report about Applicant\u2019s \npast history content, but he may have a different conclusion. He further stated that judging \nby current symptoms, the psychiatrist would opine that Applicant suffers from anxiety \ndisorder not otherwise specified. Applicant may also have obsessive compulsive traits. \nThe psychiatrist stated he did not see any current evidence of a major depressive disorder \nor psychotic symptomatology. He further stated: \u201cI want to clarify that this does not mean \n                                                          \n5 Tr. 27-31, 38-41. \n \n6 GE 3.  \n \n7 GE 3. \n \n8 Tr. 42. \n \n9 Tr. 26, 45-48. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthat it was not true before.\u201d10 Applicant testified that when he returned to see the \npsychiatrist in October 2018, the psychiatrist did not perform nor did he participate in any \nnew or updated tests.11  \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2015. \nSection 21-Psycholgical and Emotional Health, asked in the last seven years have you \nconsulted with a health care professional regarding an emotional or mental health \ncondition or were you hospitalized for such a condition. The question stated: \u201cAnswer \u2018No\u2019 \nif any of the counseling was for any of the following reasons and was not court ordered: \nstrictly marital, family or grief not related to violence by you.\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to \nthe question and failed to disclose his 2014 hospitalization; his mental-health treatment \nafter his suicide attempt; his subsequent mental-health treatment where he was \ndiagnosed with a major depressive disorder, initial episode with psychotic features; \nprescribed anti-depressant medication; and received subsequent treatment at a different \nmental health and counseling facility through at least March 2015.  \n \n \nApplicant was asked by Department Counsel if the word \u201chospitalize\u201d triggered a \nthought that maybe he should disclose his hospitalization. He testified:  \n \nI did not know who to ask and so I thought I was answering appropriately at \nthe time, given the answer no if I \u2013not everyone knows what happened to \nme and that was my personal privacy right I felt. I did the best I could to \nanswer the question honestly and truthfully and I signed the medical release \nforms, you know, at the end willingly.12   \n \n \nApplicant was asked by Department Counsel if he reported his hospitalization after \nthe June 2014 incident. Applicant testified: \u201cThey knew I was hospitalized. They don\u2019t \nknow why I was hospitalized. But HR was contacted and then security, so.\u201d When further \nquestioned about whether anyone inquired as to the reason for Applicant\u2019s \nhospitalization, he testified: \u201cThey respected personal privacy, you know. They knew I \nwas out and I was, you know, receiving treatment at a facility.\u201d13 He confirmed his \nemployer knew he was at a mental-health facility. He was on short-term disability while \nhe was an outpatient until November 2014 and then he worked part time in December. \nHe resumed ful- time employment in January 2015.14 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his failure to disclose the above requested information \nwas because he misinterpreted the question. He said he interpreted \u201cgrief\u201d to mean he \ndid not have to disclose the information because the reason he attempted suicide was \n                                                          \n10 AE C. \n \n11 Tr. 32-33, 48-50. \n \n12 Tr. 54. \n \n13 Tr. 58. \n \n14 Tr. 58-61. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nbecause he was grieving. He also said he was dealing with a multitude of stressors. \nDuring his background interview with a government investigator in December 2016, he \nexplained he considered his treatment as being grief-related following a breakup with his \ngirlfriend. He also explained he was feeling depressed and overwhelmed because he was \nworking long hours and his father was having health issues. He said the combination of \nthese stressors resulted in his suicide attempt.15 \n \nThe SCA specifically asked about hospitalization, highlighting the need to disclose \nthis type of information. It is not believable that 15 months after Applicant was voluntarily \nhospitalized for two weeks after a suicide attempt that he did not think he had to disclose \nit. When Applicant completed the SCA in September 2015, he had previously stopped \nseeing his psychiatrist in March 2015, and he was still on medication for depression. He \nspent months as an outpatient and was on short-term disability due to mental-health \nissues. Although he told the investigator that there were many stressors that caused him \nto attempt suicide and one of them was grief, he described many others. I did not find \nApplicant\u2019s explanation credible. Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his mental-\nhealth conditions on his SCA as required.  \n \nApplicant provided character letters from a friend and his girlfriend that describe \nhim as professional, intelligent, funny, steadfast, optimistic, encouraging, proud, and \nloyal. He testified that his girlfriend is part of his support system. He provided performance \nevaluations from 2015 and 2016. His overall scores were 3.4 and 3.8 out of 5.0. He also \nprovided a 2017 performance form indicating with comments from supervisors and \nleaders noting he had done an outstanding job.16 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n                                                          \n15 Tr. 20-26, 35-38, 44-45, 53. \n \n16 Tr. 19-20; AE A, D.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG & 27:  \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and  \n \n \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \n \nApplicant attempted suicide in June 2014 by cutting his wrists. He was treated for \nphysical injuries and then he was voluntarily hospitalized as an inpatient to a mental-\nhealth facility for evaluation and treatment. Applicant was diagnosed by a duly qualified \nmental-health professional, a psychiatrist, with major depressive disorder, initial episode, \nwith psychotic features in June 2014. He was again diagnosed in February 2018, by a \nduly qualified mental health professional, a neuropsychologist, with major depressive \ndisorder, recurrent, severe, with psychotic symptoms. Applicant\u2019s prognosis by the \nneuropsychologist is guarded due to untreated symptoms of mood disturbance and \npsychosis, and limited awareness of his mental status. The neuropsychologist further \nnoted that his reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness could be affected by his \npsychiatric symptoms. The above disqualifying condition applies. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nThe evidence is insufficient to establish any of the above mitigating conditions. The \nrecord does not contain a favorable prognosis from a duly qualified medical professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, or a recent medical \nopinion that Applicant\u2019s condition is under control, in remission, or has a low probability \nof recurrence or exacerbation. There is no evidence that his condition was temporary. He \nprovided an opinion from his former doctor who Applicant visited in October 2018. \nApplicant had not been treated or evaluated by that doctor since March 2015, despite \ndisagreeing with the more current diagnosis and prognosis. I have considered that \ndoctor\u2019s opinion, but it does not outweigh the more recent diagnosis by a government \napproved mental-health professional. The evidence is insufficient to conclude the issues \nraised have been mitigated and are no longer a security concern. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \nThere is sufficient evidence to conclude Applicant deliberately failed to disclose on \nhis September 2015 SCA his hospitalization and treatment by a health care professional \nregarding a mental health condition. Applicant attempted suicide in June 2014, was \ntreated for his physical injuries, and then voluntarily admitted himself as an inpatient to a \nmental-health facility for two weeks for evaluation and treatment. He was diagnosed by a \npsychiatrist with major depressive disorder, initial episode, with psychotic features in June \n2014; prescribed anti-depressant medications; and received treatment at a mental-health \ncenter through March 2015. He stated he believed he did not need to disclose this \ninformation because the language of the question said he did not have to disclose it if the \ncounseling was for grief. He said he was grieving a breakup with his girlfriend, but there \n\n \n9 \n \n \nwere a multitude of stressors that caused him to attempt suicide. I found Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation was not believable and disingenuous.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 were \nconsidered: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect his omissions or falsifications made when completing his SCA. Applicant\u2019s failure \nto disclose to the Government the information about his background that was requested \nis not minor. The Government relies on those seeking security clearances to be honest \nduring the security clearance process. His intentional failure to do so casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions do not \napply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \n\n \n10 \n \n \nGuideline I and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old highly educated man. He experienced mental health \nissues and attempted suicide in 2014. At this time, insufficient evidence was presented \nto mitigate the psychological conditions raising security concerns. Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose this information on his SCA. The record evidence leaves me with serious \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline I, psychological conditions and Guideline E, personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2. Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and purchased marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.b) from January 2010 to at least March 2018, and that during a March 6, 2018 interview with a DOD authorized investigator he stated an intention to continue using marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations without comment. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 57-year-old mechanical designer with post-high school certifications in mechanical drafting technology and computer-aided drafting. His first marriage ended after only two years. He was married to his second wife from July 1989 to February 2008. Applicant has a 27-year-old son and a 23-year-old daughter. An innovative mechanical designer, Applicant spent much of his career in the medical device industry, and he holds patents involving medical methods and devices.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant used marijuana from January 2010 to at least November 2018, since July \n2018 with a state-issued medical marijuana card. He is not committed to abstention despite \nknowing that marijuana remains illegal under Federal law. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and explaining why \nit was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n01/04/2019\n\n2 \n \nOn July 17, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn September 7, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On October 5, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for November 16, \n2018. \n \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Two Government exhibits (GEs 1-2) were \nadmitted in evidence. An August 9, 2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant \nand a list of the GEs were marked as hearing exhibits (HEs I and II) for the record but not \nadmitted in evidence. Six Applicant exhibits (AEs A-F) were admitted in evidence. Applicant \ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on November 29, 2018. I held the record \nopen for three weeks after the hearing for additional evidence from Applicant. No \ndocuments were received, and the record closed on December 7, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and purchased marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.b) from January 2010 to at \nleast March 2018, and that during a March 6, 2018 interview with a DOD authorized \ninvestigator he stated an intention to continue using marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When he \nresponded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations without comment. After \nconsidering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old mechanical designer with post-high school certifications in \nmechanical drafting technology and computer-aided drafting. His first marriage ended after \nonly two years. He was married to his second wife from July 1989 to February 2008. \nApplicant has a 27-year-old son and a 23-year-old daughter. An innovative mechanical \ndesigner, Applicant spent much of his career in the medical device industry, and he holds \npatents involving medical methods and devices. Applicant has worked for his defense-\ncontractor employer in computer-aided design since March 2015. He seeks a security \nclearance for his position, although he understands that he can continue to work for his \nemployer without a clearance. (GEs 1-2; AEs B, E-F; Tr. 26-29.) \n \nIn 2007, Applicant was diagnosed with a degenerative eye disease. (AE C; Tr. 36.)   \nAt the suggestion of his godson, Applicant began using marijuana in January 2010, initially \nfor degenerative discs and to relieve pressure in his eyes. (GE 1; Tr. 25-26, 55.) Applicant \ncontinued to use marijuana approximately twice weekly as needed for pain or to sleep to at \nleast November 2018. He traveled to Asia for his then employer for seven weeks in April \n2012. He did not use any marijuana during that trip. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 35, 64.) Applicant \npurchased marijuana from his friends until July 2018. (GE 2; AE D.) \n \nIn January 2015, Applicant began outpatient psychotherapy with a licensed clinical \nsocial worker for diagnosed depression and anxiety. He was honest with his therapist about \nhis use of marijuana. He advised her that he used marijuana at times when experiencing \n\n3 \n \nheightened anxiety or depression not adequately addressed by his psychiatric \nmedications.1 (AE A.) \n \nApplicant took a pre-employment drug screen to work for his employer in early 2015. \nHe refrained from using marijuana before the test because he knew he would be drug \ntested, and \u201cbecause every now and then, it\u2019s nice to give [himself] a little break.\u201d He \npassed the drug screen. (Tr. 30-31.) Applicant understands that his employer has a policy \nprohibiting illegal drug use by its employees, although the company has publicized that \nmedical marijuana use would be handled akin to alcohol abuse. (Tr. 30-32.) \n \nTwo years into his job with his current employer, Applicant completed and certified \nto the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on November 8, \n2017. He responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he had illegally used \nany drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years, and disclosed that marijuana \n\u201cwas and is sometime used\u201d to control pain and stomach issues and relieve pressure in his \neyes. He gave estimated dates of January 2010 for his first use and September 2017 for \nhis most recent use. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to whether he intended to use marijuana in the \nfuture, but then stated \u201cdepends on the level of pain and discomfort I experience. I always \nuse this as a last resort because I cannot take vicoden [sic] for pain or discomfort because \nit tears my stomach apart.\u201d Applicant responded negatively to an inquiry into whether he \nhad been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, \ntransfer, shipping, receiving, handling or sale of any drug or controlled substance in the last \nseven years. (GE 1; Tr. 33.) \n \nOn March 6, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He admitted that he used marijuana since \nJanuary 2010 for pain related to his medical issues and for a sleep aid because his \nstomach does not tolerate prescription medications. He expressed an intention to continue \nto use marijuana for pain, and a high likelihood that he would use marijuana in the future \ndue to the pain associated with his medical conditions. He disclosed that he obtained his \nmarijuana illegally through friends who legally cultivate marijuana. He obtained a half \nounce of marijuana every other month at a cost of $70 each time. Applicant denied \nsocializing with any individuals who use drugs illegally. (GE 2.) \n \nApplicant now acknowledges that he used marijuana probably a couple of times a \nweek since 2010. (Tr. 47.) He attempted to reduce or cease his marijuana use over the \npast year, but he continued to use the drug to at least November 14, 2018. (Tr. 34-35.) On \nJuly 20, 2018, he obtained a state-issued medical marijuana card authorizing him to use \nmarijuana legally in the state for the next year under its medical marijuana program.2  (AE \n                                                 \n1 Applicant\u2019s medications are currently being monitored by a psychiatry practice. He has been in treatment with \nthat provider since May 2016. (AE B.) \n \n2 The state\u2019s medical marijuana act was passed in 2005. Section 21.-28.6-4 of state law provides in part: \n \n(a) A qualifying patient cardholder who has in his or her possession a registry identification \ncard shall not be subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty in any manner, or denied any right \nor privilege, including, but not limited to, civil penalty or disciplinary action by a business or \n\n4 \n \nD.) Since obtaining his medical marijuana card, Applicant has purchased his marijuana \nfrom an authorized dispensary. (Tr. 42.) He acknowledged that he had previously \npurchased the drug illegally in half-ounce quantities every two months for $70 from friends \nthat grow marijuana for \u201ccompassion science.\u201d (Tr. 48.) Applicant obtained his medical \nmarijuana card because after he applied for a security clearance, he wanted \u201cto try to do \neverything as legally as [he] can.\u201d (Tr. 46.)  As to why he waited to late July 2018 to obtain \na medical marijuana card given he applied for a clearance in November 2017, Applicant \nresponded: \n \nBecause it wasn\u2019t\u2014I think the dispensaries may have just came around at \nthat point. I probably didn\u2019t have the extra $300. And it really wasn\u2019t an issue. \nI was so low-keyed and I try to keep everything under wraps that\u2014I just \ndidn\u2019t see a need for it. But now that I\u2019m here and everything, I want \neverything to be\u2014lay it out\u2014I want to be honest. I want to be as legal as I \ncan. And that\u2019s part of my problem is I\u2019m way too honest. (Tr. 46-47.)  \n \nApplicant understands that marijuana use is still illegal under Federal law, and that \nhe had used marijuana illegally. The state in which he lived from December 2004 to May \n2017 did not legalize recreational use of marijuana until December 2016.3 Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent state of residency has not legalized recreational use of marijuana. Applicant looked \ninto the laws governing marijuana, but he did not see the illegality as an issue because he \nwas using marijuana for medical reasons in his home \u201cto control things that [he has] no \ncontrol over.\u201d (Tr. 52-53.) Applicant intends to continue to use marijuana, but not at great \nfrequency. He has never used marijuana at work. (Tr. 59-60.) \n \nApplicant has not advised anyone at work about his marijuana use (\u201cIt\u2019s used for \nmedical purposes. I don\u2019t tell them all my medicines I take.\u201d). (Tr. 32-33.) Applicant \ncontinues to take medications for his eyes, but they create a burning sensation. (AE C; Tr. \n                                                                                                                                                             \noccupational or professional licensing board or bureau, for the medical use of marijuana; \nprovided, that the qualifying patient cardholder possesses an amount of marijuana that does \nnot exceed twelve (12) mature marijuana plants that are accompanied by valid medical \nmarijuana tags, two and one-half (2.5) ounces of usable marijuana, or its equivalent amount, \nand an amount of wet marijuana to be set by regulations promulgated by the departments of \nhealth and business regulation. Said plants shall be stored in an indoor facility. \n \n(b) An authorized purchaser who has in his or her possession a registry identification card \nshall not be subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty in any manner, or denied any right or \nprivilege, including, but not limited to, civil penalty or disciplinary action by a business or \noccupational or professional licensing board or bureau, for the possession of marijuana; \nprovided that the authorized purchaser possesses an amount of marijuana that does not \nexceed two and one-half (2.5) ounces of usable marijuana, or its equivalent amount, and this \nmarijuana was purchased legally from a compassion center for the use of their designated \nqualifying patient. \n \n3 Effective January 2, 2009, that state decriminalized possession of an ounce or less of marijuana and \nimposed a civil penalty of $100 and forfeiture of the marijuana. Effective January 1, 2013, the state established \na medical marijuana program. Applicant\u2019s eye disease is one of the covered conditions under the program. \nThe state legalized possession of one ounce of marijuana for recreational use by persons age 21 and older \neffective December 15, 2016, but .   \n\n5 \n \n38.) He shared with his optometrist during an appointment one Saturday that he had \nsmoked marijuana three hours before his appointment. She advised him that the relief in \neye pressure from marijuana was only temporary. His optometrist is not licensed to \nprescribe medical marijuana. (Tr. 39-40.) She corroborates his eye condition, which is \nstable and currently being managed with topical medications. (AE C.) \n  \nApplicant\u2019s outpatient psychotherapist indicated that, to her knowledge, Applicant\u2019s \nuse of marijuana, \u201cabout once a week,\u201d has not interfered with his work performance. She \nhas not seen any behavior by Applicant that makes her concerned. He has always been \ntrustworthy, stable, and responsible, and she has not identified anything about his \nmarijuana use that, in her opinion, contributes to any security concerns. (AE A.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s psychiatric provider also attested to Applicant primarily using marijuana \nfor relief of pain and pressure related to his eye disease, and she added that the medical \nliterature supports use of marijuana for the condition. She also noted that Applicant finds \nmarijuana helpful with anxiety but that it was not the primary reason why Applicant uses \nmarijuana. She considers Applicant\u2019s mood to be stable and his psychiatric symptoms well \nmanaged. (AE B.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n\n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nWith the exception of a seven-week business trip to Asia in 2012, Applicant used \nmarijuana approximately twice a week and purchased marijuana once every two months \nfrom January 2010 to at least November 2018. His use and purchase after July 20, 2018, \nwas with a medical marijuana card obtained legally in his state.4 Disqualifying conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse (see above definition),\u201d and 25(c), \u201cillegal possession \nof a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d apply. Moreover, Applicant has candidly \nadmitted that he intends to continue to use medical marijuana in the future, albeit not at \ngreat frequency, to cope with his medical conditions. AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to \n                                                 \n4 Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I drug. Despite some states providing for medical marijuana use or the \ndecriminalization or legalization of recreational use of minor amounts of the drug, marijuana remains a \nSchedule I controlled substance under federal law. Such drugs have a high potential for abuse, no currently \naccepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and lack accepted safety for using the drug under \nmedical supervision. \n  \n\n7 \n \ncontinue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly \ncommit to continue such misuse,\u201d also applies. \n \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. AG \u00b6 26 \nprovides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility;  \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended: and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant used marijuana with the same \nconsistency for almost nine years in knowing violation of Federal law. For all but the last \nfew months, his use and purchase was also illegal under state law. Applicant candidly \nadmits that he intends to use and purchase marijuana with his medical marijuana card in \nthe future, fully aware that state laws permitting medical marijuana do not alter the federal \nprohibition or existing national security guidelines concerning marijuana use.  Applicant \ndenies any dependency on marijuana. Both his therapist and his psychiatric provider are \naware of and are not concerned about his marijuana use to alleviate pain and pressure \nfrom his eye disease and other medical conditions. However, Applicant cannot satisfy AG \u00b6 \n26(b) as long as he intends to continue to use marijuana. The drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \n\n8 \n \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).5 In that regard, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is troubling because of his mature age and \nknowing disregard of the drug laws for several years. He rationalized his illegal drug use as \nnecessary to avert the negative side-effects of his medications. He knew that he could \nhave obtained a medical marijuana card that would have legalized his use and purchase in \nthe state, but he saw no need for it until the SOR was issued. Even now, he continues to \nact in self-interest. The Government must be able to rely on the persons entrusted with the \nNation\u2019s secrets to comply with their clearance obligations, which include following Federal \nlaw and DOD policy against marijuana use, including medical marijuana. Applicant has \nraised considerable doubts in that regard. Although his candor about his marijuana \ninvolvement weighs in his favor, for the reasons noted, I find that it is not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with some comments, nearly all of the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g.), drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a., 2.b., and 2.d.); and personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b. and 3.c.). He either denied or failed to address the remaining allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions and accompanying comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving in an unspecified position with his current employer since August 2015. A 2013 high school graduate, he earned some college credits, but no degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant has never been married, and he has no children. Alcohol Consumption Applicant commenced drinking alcohol out of curiosity in 2006, when he was about 12 years old, and he continued doing so until 2008. He generally stole a beer from his father\u2019s refrigerator two to three times per year. Starting in 2008, his consumption steadily increased, and he went from two beers every three months, to five of six beers every three months, to eight to ten beers every two weeks. By August 2013, Applicant was consuming 15 to 30 beers on weekends at college. From May ",

Gregorian, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/08/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding alcohol consumption, \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, and personal conduct. Eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 22, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire For National Security Positions (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He \nresponded to those interrogatories on June 20, 2018. On December 31, 2018, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption), H \n(Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse), and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed \nreasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a notarized statement dated July 5, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on August 8, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days, \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition \nto the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on August 12, 2019. His \nresponse was due on September 11, 2019. Applicant did not submit any response to the \nFORM. The case was assigned to me on October 16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with some comments, nearly all of \nthe factual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g.), drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a., 2.b., and 2.d.); and personal conduct \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b. and 3.c.). He either denied or failed to address the remaining allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and accompanying comments are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nin an unspecified position with his current employer since August 2015. A 2013 high \nschool graduate, he earned some college credits, but no degree. He has never served \nwith the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant has never been \nmarried, and he has no children. \n \nAlcohol Consumption  \n \n \nApplicant commenced drinking alcohol out of curiosity in 2006, when he was about \n12 years old, and he continued doing so until 2008. He generally stole a beer from his \nfather\u2019s refrigerator two to three times per year. Starting in 2008, his consumption steadily \nincreased, and he went from two beers every three months, to five of six beers every \nthree months, to eight to ten beers every two weeks. By August 2013, Applicant was \nconsuming 15 to 30 beers on weekends at college. From May 2014 until January 2016, \nhe drank 10 to 20 beers on weekends. In January 2016, he was drinking on a nightly \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nbasis, and on least one occasion, he consumed a 30-pack of beer over a two-day period. \n(Item 4, at 123) His early curiosity about alcohol transitioned into believing that drinking \nwas \u201ccool\u201d and fun. He also enjoyed being \u201cbuzzed\u201d or drunk. On at least six or seven \noccasions, Applicant\u2019s drinking resulted in his intoxication, and caused him to black out. \n(Item 3, at 12-13) Applicant acknowledged that he would \u201cget the shakes [and] need a \ndrink.\u201d (Item 4, at 8) \n \n \nOn October 20, 2016, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant acknowledged that his use of alcohol \noccurred only on the weekends. Because he became calm when intoxicated, he drank \nseven to eight beers to intoxication about once every month. He denied having a problem \nwith drinking, and he expressed an intention not to stop doing so. (Item 3, at 6)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with alcohol has resulted in several incidents involving \neither injury to himself or being charged with various violations. In January 2015, he was \nobserved by the police holding a beer in the back seat of a vehicle. He was issued a \nsummons for possession of alcohol by minor. After pleading guilty to the charge, Applicant \nwas ordered to attend an eight-hour alcohol class sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving (MADD). Less than five months later, he was again issued a summons for \npossession of alcohol by minor when he was observed walking on a college campus with \na beer in his hand. After pleading guilty to the charge, he was ordered to complete eight \nhours of community service. (Item 3, at 5-6) In the spring of 2015 or 2016, while at a \ncasino, Applicant became intoxicated, blacked out, got thrown over a blackjack table, and \nhe was transported to the hospital emergency room. (Item 4, at 7, 11, 53; Item 1)   \n \n \nIn January 2016, Applicant consumed 10 to 12 beers and 3 to 4 shots of liquor \nwithin a two-to-five-hour period at a house party. The following morning, he consumed \nadditional liquor. He then drove his vehicle, not caring that he was under the influence of \nalcohol. He either ran a stop-sign and struck a moving vehicle, or he rear-ended a stopped \nvehicle, depending on which version of the incident Applicant reported. When the police \narrived, they administered Applicant a field sobriety test, which he failed. He was arrested \nand charged with driving under the influence (DUI). He was administered two breathalyzer \ntests, both of which registered high percentages: 0.17 percent and 0.21 percent. (Item 3, \nat 6, 12) He entered a plea of guilty to the DUI. Applicant was ordered to attend another \nMADD program; directed to obtain alcohol treatment; required to have an ignition interlock \ndevice installed on his vehicle for six months; and his operator\u2019s license was suspended \nfor 60 or 90 days. (Item 3, at 6, 12) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that his 2016 DUI was the result of an \u201cirresponsible and \nreckless mistake.\u201d In his Answer to the SOR, He added: \u201cI regard the situation though \nunfortunate, as a catalyst to the curbing of my behavior in a much more responsible light.\u201d \n(Item 1)    \n \n \nNevertheless, between July 2016 and October 2016, Applicant operated a vehicle \non five or ten occasions while he was under the influence of alcohol. He did so because \nhe thought he could manage driving, he was not traveling too far, or he did not care that \nhe was under the influence. (Item 3, at 13) In July or August 2016, while under the \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \ninfluence of alcohol, Applicant fell off a roof, and he was hospitalized for stitches on his \nface and hand. (Item 4, at 7, 11; Item 1) On at least one occasion, after drinking in the \nmorning, he waited until the afternoon before trying to drive. That effort resulted in the \nignition interlock device recognizing that Applicant had consumed alcohol, and he failed \nto unlock it. (Item 4, at 123; Item 1) \n \n \nOn October 14, 2016, Applicant enrolled in the intensive outpatient program of a \nsubstance abuse treatment program. During his intake assessment, he acknowledged \nthat his initial use of alcohol occurred when he was 10 years old, that regular use occurred \nat the age of 19, and that over the six-month period preceding the assessment, he had \nbeen drinking up to two beers per day, with binge drinking on the weekends. (Item 4, at \n5) He underwent individual and group therapy. During the program, Applicant was \ndiagnosed under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Ed. \n(DSM-V), with Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe. (Item 4, at 19, 123)  \n \nDespite his participation in the program, Applicant admitted continuing his reduced \nconsumption of alcohol on several occasions in October and December 2016. (Item 4, at \n49-50, 55) On December 19, 2016, the intensive outpatient treatment program ceased, \nand Applicant was recommended to continue his goal of reduced alcohol intake, and to \ncontinue ongoing substance abuse treatment on a weekly basis for individual therapy and \ngroup therapy for additional support. He was prescribed naltrexone \u2013 a medication used \nto treat alcoholism by reducing the urge to drink alcohol \u2013 as needed. (Item 4, at 46) \nApplicant denied the SOR allegation and he contends that he completed the program to \nits completion, and the Government offered no evidence that Applicant had failed to follow \ntreatment advice. As recently as June 2018, Applicant admitted that he continued to \nconsume two to four drinks per weekend or less. (Item 3, at 16) \n  \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nApplicant was also a recreational substance abuser whose primary substances of \nchoice were marijuana, cocaine, and amphetamines. In addition, although not alleged in \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted that he was a frequent user of unspecified hallucinogens. \n(Item 4, at 6, 41) As noted above, on October 14, 2016, Applicant enrolled in the intensive \noutpatient program. During his intake assessment, in addition to the information furnished \nregarding alcohol, he acknowledged that he commenced using marijuana in \napproximately 2004, when he was 15 years old, and continued his regular use of \nmarijuana until September 2016. He used cocaine on various occasions from at least an \nunspecified date in 2015 until at least October 2016. (Item 4, at 5-6; Item 1)  \n \nDespite his participation in the program, Applicant\u2019s urine toxicology screens \ntested positive for cocaine on several occasions: October 24, 2016; October 25, 2016; \nOctober 28, 2016; October 31, 2016; and November 1, 2016, and he admitted continuing \nhis use of cocaine. (Item 4, at 55, 142-146) In addition, Applicant\u2019s urine toxicology screen \ntested positive for amphetamines on December 16, 2016. (Item 4, at 127; Item 1)  \n \nIn his response to the interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged the use of Adderall \n\u2013 a combination medication containing four salts of amphetamine \u2013 which was also a \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nprescribed medication for someone other than himself, in February 2017. (Item 3, at 17) \nThat acknowledgement was apparently the basis of the SOR allegation that he had \nmisused Adderall. However, in his Answer to the SOR, Applicant clarified his response \nand claimed that he had made a mistake because of confusion on his part. He contended \nthat the Adderall misuse was actually the same December 2016 incident reported as a \nresult of his positive urine toxicology screen tested positive for amphetamines. During the \nprogram, Applicant was diagnosed under the DSM-V with Cocaine Use Disorder, a \ndiagnosis he denied being aware of. (Item 4, at 120, 123; Item 1) Starting in January \n2019, and continuing until March 2019, Applicant underwent drug screens ordered by a \nphysician. All of the toxicology screens were negative. (Item 1 attachments) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nOn April 22, 2015, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded to certain \nquestions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23 \u2013 Illegal \nUse of Drugs or Drug Activity. The most significant question, and the one alleged in the \nSOR, was essentially as follows: In the last seven (7) years: \u201chave you illegally used any \ndrugs or controlled substances?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the question. (Item 2, at 24) \nHe omitted and concealed his subsequently admitted use of marijuana. He certified that \nhis response to that question was \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his \nknowledge and belief, but, because of his omission and concealment, the response to \nthat question was, in fact, false. Applicant admitted the allegation. (Item 1) With respect \nto the cocaine aspect of the question, the Government failed to prove that Applicant had \nused cocaine at any time before he submitted the SF 86 in April 2015, and Applicant only \nadmitted that he had used it in 2015 and 2016. \n \n \nOn June 20, 2018, when Applicant completed his responses to the interrogatories, \nhe responded to a question pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in \nQuestion 1 \u2013 Drug Use. He was asked to provide a complete history of his use of any \nillegal narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), Cannabis \n(marijuana or Hashish), prescription drug without a valid prescription, and any misuse of \na drug prescribed to you (e.g., taking more than the required dosage, etc.). Although he \nacknowledged his misuse of Adderall, he omitted and concealed his subsequently \nadmitted use of marijuana and cocaine. He swore that his response to those that question \nwas \u201ctrue and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, because of his \nomissions and concealments, the response to that question was, in fact, false. Applicant \nadmitted the allegation, and added that \u201cthe deliberate withholding of information I now \nrealize was unbecoming and illustrates untrustworthiness. I believe at the time I was \nnervous and admittedly frightened of the consequences for disclosing that type of \ninformation.\u201d (Item 1)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \n The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:  \n      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; and  \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), 22(c), 22(d), and 22(e) have all been established. AG \u00b6 22(b) \nhas not been established as there is no evidence of any alcohol-related incidents at work. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with alcohol has seen him routinely binge drinking and becoming \nintoxicated. It has resulted in several incidents involving either injury to himself or being \ncharged with various violations. He has been convicted and sentenced on three separate \noccasions for alcohol-related violations, including DUI. There were other incidents \ninvolving alcohol, such as falling off a roof and blacking out in a casino where no police \nor court authorities were involved. Despite completing court-mandated alcohol education \nand training, one effort to drive failed when the ignition interlock device in his car refused \nto unlock because it detected alcohol on him.  \n \nApplicant was diagnosed under the DSM-V with Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe. \nWhen the intensive outpatient treatment program ceased, Applicant was recommended \nto continue ongoing substance abuse treatment on a weekly basis for individual therapy \nand group therapy for additional support. Applicant has a substantial history of \nmaladaptive alcohol use, and despite claiming that he wishes to conquer his relationship \nwith alcohol, he continues to drink.  \n \nThe guideline also includes several examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that \ncould mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Despite three convictions for alcohol \npossession by minor (two in 2015) and DUI (in 2016), accompanied by a variety of \nsentences, including minimal overnight stays in jail; fines; attendance of MADD and other \nalcohol education classes; community service; a suspended operator\u2019s license; and the \ncourt-mandated installation of an ignition interlock device on his car, Applicant learned \nlittle if anything regarding drinking and driving. Rather than learning from the alcohol \nclasses and considering the negative impact of his continuing alcohol-related conduct, he \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nreturned to his pattern of alcohol consumption, albeit at a more modified level. As recently \nas October 2016, Applicant denied that he had a problem with alcohol, and he expressed \nan intention not to stop drinking alcohol.  \n \nAs noted above, when the intensive outpatient treatment program ceased, \nApplicant was recommended to continue ongoing substance abuse treatment on a weekly \nbasis for individual therapy and group therapy for additional support. He offered no \nevidence to indicate that he had followed the program recommendations. Applicant\u2019s \nmaladaptive alcohol use continued for over a decade. Appellant has failed to demonstrate \na clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence, and under the \ncircumstances, there remain doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder.  \n \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser who regularly used \nmarijuana, transitioned to cocaine, and experimented with amphetamines. During his \nparticipation in intensive outpatient treatment, his urine toxicology screens tested positive \nfor both cocaine and amphetamines. Applicant was diagnosed under the DSM-V, with \nCocaine Use Disorder. When the intensive outpatient treatment program ceased, \nApplicant was recommended to continue ongoing substance abuse treatment on a weekly \nbasis for individual therapy and group therapy for additional support. He offered no \nevidence of having complied with that recommendation, thus limiting the weight of his \nsuccessful completion of the initial program. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), 25(c), and 25(d) have \nbeen established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) minimally applies, but no other mitigating condition applies. Applicant \nregularly used marijuana and cocaine and experimented with amphetamines. As such, \nthere was nothing infrequent about his marijuana or cocaine use, and there is no evidence \nto indicate that his use happened under such circumstances that it was unlikely to recur. \nApplicant now acknowledges his past drug involvement and substance misuse, and he \nhas furnished documentary evidence that his recent urine toxicology screens tested \nnegative for any of the identified substances, including marijuana, cocaine, and \namphetamines. However, he offered no evidence to indicate that he has ended his \nrelationships with his drug-using friends; or that he avoids the environment where drugs \nwere used. Furthermore, he has not submitted a formal statement acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct in the past, but in \nthis instance, the most recent drug involvement and substance misuse, was in December \n2016, when his urine toxicology screen tested positive for amphetamines.  Given his \ncavalier attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, \ncocaine, and a prescription medication that was not prescribed for him, despite knowing \nthat such use was prohibited by the Government, continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse is \nadopted herein. At the time Applicant completed his SF 86 in June 2015, he concealed \nany references to his history of drug involvement and substance misuse. He was more \ncandid with the OPM investigator in October 2016. As recently as June 2018, when he \nresponded to the interrogatories, he continued to conceal his marijuana and cocaine use, \nbut did admit his misuse of an amphetamine. Normally an applicant\u2019s comments provide \nsufficient evidence to examine if his or her submissions were deliberate falsifications, as \nalleged in the SOR, or merely inaccurate answers that were the result of oversight or \nmisunderstanding of the true facts on his or her part. Proof of incorrect answers, standing \nalone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nfalsification or omission occurred. As an administrative judge, I must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the alleged falsifications or \nomissions occurred.  \n \nI have considered the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admission of the SOR \nallegations. As noted above, Applicant did not controvert the falsification allegations. In \nhis Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted failing to disclose his illegal drug use in his \n2015 SF 86. He noted that the \u201cdeliberate withholding of information I now realize was \nunbecoming and illustrates untrustworthiness.\u201d He added that he was nervous and \nadmittedly frightened of the consequences for disclosing the truth, and he acknowledged \nit was an act of self-preservation. He did not claim that he misinterpreted the questions, \nor that he forgot his drug involvement and substance misuse. In other words, he \nintentionally concealed his substance misuse and falsified his responses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), \n16(b), and 16(c) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nNeither of the conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s false responses to the SF 86 inquiry \noccurred in April 2015, and his false responses to the interrogatories occurred in June \n2018. He was candid with the OPM investigator in October 2016. It took nearly an \nadditional year, until July 2019, when Applicant finally acknowledged his history of drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse when he completed his Answer to the SOR. However, \nbefore those SOR admissions, aside from his OPM candor, he made no efforts to correct \nthe omissions, concealments, or falsifications associated with his earlier false responses. \nApplicant\u2019s attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations while seeking a security \nclearance, lasted approximately four years. Despite his claimed new maturity, Applicant\u2019s \nactions under the circumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 25-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving in an unspecified position with \nhis current employer since August 2015. A 2013 high school graduate, he earned some \ncollege credits, but no degree. He has reportedly abstained from any drug involvement \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nand substance misuse since December 2016. Applicant finally disclosed his history of \ndrug involvement and substance misuse when he answered the SOR in July 2019. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant admittedly was a regular marijuana and cocaine user, and he experimented \nwith amphetamines. He routinely consumed alcohol to excess. In 2016, he was \ndiagnosed under the DSM-V with Cocaine Use Disorder; and Alcohol Use Disorder, \nSevere. Between July 2016 and October 2016, he operated a vehicle on five or ten \noccasions while he was under the influence of alcohol. He did so because he thought he \ncould manage driving, he was not traveling too far, or he did not care that he was under \nthe influence. This latter explanation \u2013 that he did not care that he was under the influence \nof alcohol \u2013 is the most troubling, for it indicates that Applicant was aware of his situation. \n \nApplicant attempted to conceal his drug involvement and substance abuse in his \n2015 SF 86, and in his June 2018 responses to the interrogatories. While he was candid \nin October 2016, he continued to conceal the truth. He explained that his efforts were \ndeliberate, and he acknowledged it was an act of self-preservation. Although Applicant \nwas diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, he continues to consume alcohol. \nApplicant\u2019s attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations, is unacceptable, especially for \none who is an applicant for a security clearance. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol \nconsumption; drug involvement and substance abuse; and personal conduct. See SEAD \n4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On July 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated July 26, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on August 24, 2018. The case was assigned to me \non January 10, 2019. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 13, 2019. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on April 2, 2019. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 10, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE G were admitted into evidence without objection. I also marked \nfor identification and included three Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through HE III. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 11, 2019. I kept the record open to \nenable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely                    \nsubmitted additional documents which were marked and admitted into evidence as AE H \nthrough AE AC without objection. The record closed on May 2, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments four of the factual \nallegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., and 1.f.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and \ncomments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a sheet metal mechanic with his current employer since October 2014. A 1983 high \nschool graduate, he earned some college credits, but no degree. Applicant enlisted in the \nU.S. Navy in May 1984, and he was honorably retired as a petty officer first class (E-6) in \nMay 2004. He was granted a secret clearance in 1986, and it was renewed in 2005. \nApplicant was married in 1988. He has two daughters, born in 1989 and 1991. \n \nMilitary Record \n \n \nDuring his military career, Applicant was deployed on several occasions to the \nEastern Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. He was awarded the Navy Sea Service \nDeployment Ribbon (four awards); the Navy Battle \u201cE\u201d Ribbon (four awards); the Navy \nGood Conduct Medal (five awards); the National Defense Service Medal (two awards); \nthe Enlisted Aviation Warfare Insignia; the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal \n(two awards); the Navy Expert Pistol Shot Medal; the Southwest Asia Service Medal; the \nNavy Meritorious Unit Commendation (five awards); and the Armed Force Expeditionary \nMedal.1 \n                                                          \n1 AE H (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214), dated April 6, 1988); \nAE I (DD Form 214, dated May 31, 2004). \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nFinancial Considerations2 \n \nApplicant underwent major back surgery in August 2011, and as a result, his \nemployer did not allow him to work until he was fully recovered. Short-term disability, and \neventually long-term disability, payments were substantially less than his normal salary \nand insufficient for him to maintain all of his accounts in a current status. As a result, some \naccounts became delinquent. Applicant called his creditors to alert them to his financial \nsituation, and while some cooperated with him, his mortgage lender refused to do so, \ndemanding timely full payments. In an effort to address his growing financial issues, \nApplicant searched for an attorney, finally engaging the professional services of one \nparticular national law firm (law firm A). His attorneys advised him to stop making any \nmortgage payments and indicated that the missed payments would be added to the \nbackend of his mortgage. Commencing in December 2011, and continuing for over a \nyear, Applicant paid his attorneys, through a particular law firm serving as a financial \nservice previously known as company X, approximately $500 per month, and following \ninstructions, he did not pay his mortgage lender.3   \n \nAfter a year of making payments to law firm A, and obtaining no success regarding \nany efforts by that law firm, Applicant was referred to another particular law firm (law firm \nB) located in the same suite as law firm A.4 He continued making similar monthly \npayments to the new law firm, again for another year of professional services. Eventually, \nafter an additional period of apparent inaction, law firm B advised him to file for \nbankruptcy.5 He paid a bankruptcy attorney $3,200, and in November 2014, Applicant \nfiled for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.6 He listed $178,279 \nin assets, including $145,000 in real property; and $223,510 in total liabilities, including \n$163,205 for creditors holding secured claims (two mortgages on his residence and one \nvehicle loan), and $60,305 for creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims.7 Applicant\u2019s \nstatement of current monthly income and calculation of commitment period and \ndisposable income reflected $5,652 in monthly income, and an anticipated $5,924 in total \n                                                          \n2 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the \nfollowing exhibits: GE 2 (e-QIP, dated April 25, 2017); GE 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview (ESI), dated \nJanuary 20, 2017); GE 3 (ESI, dated January 11, 2018); GE 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated September 9, \n2015); GE 6 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated August 19, 2016);  GE & \n(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated June 1, 2017); GE 9 (2014 Chapter 13 \nBankruptcy Casefile, various dates); GE 10 (2016 Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Casefile, various dates); AE A \n(Extracts of Experian Credit Report, dated April 1, 2019), dated April 3, 2019); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nthe SOR, dated June 26, 2018.

That \nbankruptcy was dismissed in July 2015.11 \n \nAs a result of the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s non-disbursement of payments to \nApplicant\u2019s creditors, in November 2015, the creditor that had financed Applicant\u2019s \nautomobile, for which over $7,400 was still owed, repossessed the vehicle and sold it at \nauction. There was no reported deficiency, and Applicant does not owe the creditor any \nunpaid balance. During the period August 2015 through January 2016, Applicant made \npayments to some of his creditors,12 but by then, accounts had become even more \ndelinquent because of the lengthy period of previous nonpayment associated with the \nprevious legal guidance not to make payments and the non-disbursements by the \nbankruptcy trustee.  \n \nIn January 2016, Applicant refiled for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. \nBankruptcy Code, and he was assigned the same bankruptcy trustee.13 He listed \n$167,608 in assets, including $145,000 in real property; and $223,510 in total liabilities, \nincluding $155,695 for creditors holding secured claims (two mortgages on his residence), \nand $67,815 for creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims.14 Applicant\u2019s statement \nof current monthly income and calculation of commitment period and disposable income, \nand the Chapter 13 Plan, reflected $4,136 in monthly income, and an anticipated $1,962 \nin monthly expenses, leaving him with $1,593 in disposable income, which he was to pay \nthe bankruptcy trustee per month for 60 months. In addition, Applicant was required to \nparticipate in the mortgage modification mediation program and provide 31 percent of his \ngross income until mediation or until the loan is modified.15 On May 26, 2016, the \nbankruptcy trustee filed a motion to dismiss the Chapter 13 case because Applicant had \n                                                          \n8 GE 9, supra note 2, at 39-45. \n \n9 GE 9 (Amended Voluntary Petition, dated January 25, 2015), at 4-11. \n \n10 GE 9 (Motion to Dismiss, dated July 2, 2015). \n \n11 GE 9 (Final Decree, dated February 12, 2016). \n \n12 GE 4, supra note 2, at 3. \n \n13 GE 10 (Voluntary Petition, dated January 8, 2016). \n \n14 GE 10, supra note 2. \n \n15 GE 10, supra note 2. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nfailed to provide a copy of his federal income tax return for the tax year 2015.16 Because \nApplicant had already paid the bankruptcy trustee $9,381, and the bankruptcy trustee \nagain had not made any disbursements to creditors, $8,490 was eventually refunded to \nhim, and the remainder was retained for administration expenses. That bankruptcy was \ndismissed in December 2016.17 Applicant subsequently explained that he was under the \nimpression that he was only supposed to make the established monthly payments to the \nbankruptcy trustee, and that his income tax refunds ($1,100 for 2014 and $2,400 for 2015) \nwere not required as well. Furthermore, Applicant did not want to relinquish those \nrefunds.18 \n \nIn addition to his two Chapter 13 bankruptcies, the SOR identified seven \npurportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off, as \ngenerally reflected by Applicant\u2019s September 2015, August 2016, June 2017, or May 2018 \ncredit reports. Those debts total approximately $65,147. The current status of those \naccounts is as follows: \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c.): This is a second mortgage on Applicant\u2019s residence with an original \nhigh credit of $60,000 that became delinquent and was placed for collection, with $44,205 \ncharged off.19 However, commencing in November 2017 \u2013 nearly eight months before the \nSOR was issued \u2013 Applicant entered into a repayment plan with the creditor, and since \nthat date, he has been consistently making weekly $125 payments, totaling $14,258, to \nthe creditor. As of April 2019, the unpaid balance has been decreased to $33,891.20 The \naccount is in the process of being resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.): This is a finance company line of credit with a credit limit of $20,000 \nthat became delinquent and was placed for collection, with an unspecified amount \ncharged off. In May 2015, the account with an unpaid balance of $19,096 was sold to a \ndebt purchaser, erroneously referred to as a factoring company, and as of mid-2017, the \nremaining unpaid balance was $18,571.21 In August 2018, Applicant agreed to repayment \narrangements under which he has automatic electronic weekly debits of $75 taken from \nhis account. In August 2018, the outstanding balance was $13,696, and by April 2019, \nthe remaining balance had been reduced to $11,196.22 The account is in process of being \nresolved. \n \n                                                          \n16 GE 10 (Motion to Dismiss, dated May 26, 2016); AE 3, supra note 2, at 4-5. \n \n17 GE 10 (Final Decree, dated December 12, 2016). \n \n18 GE 4, supra note 2, at 3. \n \n19 GE 5, supra note 2, at 7; GE 5, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n20 AE D (Letter, dated August 2, 2018); AE AA (Letter, dated April 17, 2009); Tr. at 24-26. \n \n21 GE 6, supra note 2, at 9; GE 7, supra note 2, at 14; AE B (Account Statements, various dates). \n \n22 AE B, supra note 21; AE AC (Account Statement, dated April 12, 2019); Tr. at 25-29. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e.): This is a credit union-issued automobile loan with a high credit of \n$14,380 that became delinquent and was placed for collection, with $1,595 eventually \ncharged off.23 Applicant identified the vehicle as the one that had been repossessed, and \nalthough he believed that there was no deficiency, it appeared that there actually was \none. Applicant contacted the creditor and set up a settlement repayment agreement. He \nmade his final payment of $663.63 in April 2019, and the creditor considers the account \nsettled and satisfied.24 The account has been resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.): This is credit union-issued credit card with a high credit of $1,881 that \nbecame delinquent and was placed for collection, with $1,826, not $1,881 as alleged in \nthe SOR, charged off.25 Applicant contacted the creditor and set up a settlement \nrepayment agreement. He made his final payment of $564.58 in April 2019, and the \ncreditor considers the account settled and satisfied.26 The account has been resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g.): This is an unspecified medical account with an unpaid balance of \n$729 that was placed for collection and listed in Applicant\u2019s credit report identifying him \nas the responsible party.27 Applicant disputed the account, claiming that the service was \nprovided for his adult daughter, and although she was previously removed from his \nmedical coverage under TRICARE, this medical provider retained Applicant as the \nresponsible party. Upon receiving the correct information, on April 5, 2019, the creditor \nremoved Applicant\u2019s name from the account, and he is no longer responsible for it.28 The \naccount has been resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h.): This is a military exchange charge account with a credit limit of \n$6,800 and an unpaid balance of $4,500 that was placed for collection, with $3,880 \ncharged off in February 2016.29 According to his June 2017 credit report, Applicant was \nmaking payments.30 His most recent weekly $100 payment was made on April 19, 2019, \nand his current balance was reported to be $6,180.31 There is no indication that the \naccount is currently delinquent. \n \n                                                          \n23 GE 7, supra note 2, at 9; GE 8, supra note 2, at 2. \n \n24 AE M (Letter, dated April 4, 2019); Tr. at 29-31. \n \n25 GE 7, supra note 2, at 8; GE 8, supra note 2, at 2. \n \n26 AE N (Letter, dated April 4, 2019); Tr. at 31-32. \n \n27 GE 8, supra note 2, at 2. \n \n28 AE K (Letter, dated April 11, 2019); AE J (Letter, dated April 5, 2019). \n \n29 GE 6, supra note 2, at 7 \n \n30 GE 7, supra note 2, at 8; Tr. at 33-34, 37. \n \n31 AE Q (Letter, dated April 25, 2019); AE E (Checking Transactions \u2013 March 2019, dated April 1, \n2019); AE F (Checking Transactions \u2013 February 2019, dated April 1, 2019); AE G (Checking Transactions \n\u2013 January 2019, dated April 1, 2019); AE AB (Anticipated Payments, undated). \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i.): This is a military exchange charge account with a credit limit of $3,175 \nand an unpaid balance of $1,127 that was placed for collection, with $3,000 charged off \nin February 2016.32 According to his June 2017 credit report, Applicant was making \npayments.33 His most recent $189 payment was made on May 11, 2018, and his current \nbalance was reported to be zero.34 The account was closed by Applicant in 2018, and, \naccording to the creditor, is in good standing.35 \n \nApplicant was apparently the victim of predatory practices by some unscrupulous \nprofessional organizations from which he had sought professional legal guidance. For \nexample, in 2017, law firm A was sued by the states of Florida and Indiana, seeking \ninjunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties, and other statutory relief for violations of the \nstates\u2019 deceptive and unfair trade practices acts by the collection of advance payments; \nmaterial misrepresentations; prohibited representations; and failure to disclose. Law firm \nA targeted consumers who were in financial distress, behind on their mortgage loans, or \nin danger of losing their homes to foreclosure; it falsely represented the type of relief the \nconsumer would receive; it charged consumers upfront fees and continuing fees before \nthey had received the benefit of the service; it misrepresented the likelihood of \nnegotiating, obtaining, or arranging the represented mortgage relief services, as well as \nthe amount of time it would take to accomplish the represented mortgage relief services; \nand it told consumers to stop making payments to their mortgage loan holder or servicer \nand to start making payments to law firm A to begin the mortgage loan modification \nprocess. According to one attorney general, law firm A caused consumers to suffer past \nand ongoing substantial injury, including: paying thousands of dollars to law firm A for \nlittle or no service in return, going into foreclosure, and even losing their homes.36  \n \nLaw firm B, the organization that was located at the same suite as law firm A, and \nto which Applicant was referred by law firm A, was also a defendant in an action for \nconsumer fraud, this time by the department of banking of the state of Connecticut. \nEssentially repeating the concerns of Florida and Indiana against law firm A, Connecticut \nissued a temporary order to cease and desist; an order to make restitution to any \nConnecticut residents with whom it entered into negotiation agreements; notice of intent \nto issue order to cease and desist; notice of intent to impose civil penalty; and notice of \nright to hearing.37 \n                                                          \n \n32 GE 6, supra note 2, at 8 \n \n33 GE 7, supra note 2, at 9; Tr. at 35-36. \n \n34 AE L (Letter, dated April 12, 2019). \n \n35 AE L, supra note 34; AE C (Letter, dated July 18, 2018). \n \n36 HE I (State v. - - - (Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Restitution, Civil Penalties, and Other Statutory \nRelief), e-filed (#51254008) on January 17, 2017) (7th Cir.

Furthermore, that attorney has never been licensed to practice in Indiana. See HE II \n(Consumer Attorney Services v.

A class-action lawsuit was \nbrought against company X in 2011, claiming the company violated Washington State \nlaw and the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by \nconspiring with debt settlement providers to defraud consumers through trust accounts \nrelated to useless debt-settlement programs. Company X was the lynchpin in a broad \ncriminal enterprise which directly facilitated the fleecing of hundreds of thousands of \nunsuspecting consumers by sending hundreds of millions of dollars in exorbitant and \nunearned fees to fraudulent debt-settlement companies and charged its own inflated fees \non each and every transaction. On May 15, 2015, the U.S. District Court issued a $1.45 \nbillion default judgment against company X, which unfortunately for the plaintiffs, had \nalready ceased doing business, leaving doubt that the plaintiffs would be paid.38 \nAside from the income information appearing in Applicant\u2019s two Chapter 13 \nVoluntary Petitions, described above, on April 30, 2019, Applicant submitted a Personal \nFinancial Statement to reflect his $6,573 net monthly income; $2,613 in monthly \nexpenses; and $3,965 in debt payments, including his two mortgages, with a $2,608 \nmonthly remainder.39  \nWithin 180 days before Applicant filed his initial bankruptcy petition in 2014, he \nreceived a briefing from a credit counseling agency. He managed to save his primary \nmortgage from foreclosure, and that account is now current following a mortgage \nmodification. There is substantial evidence to indicate that Applicant\u2019s financial situation, \nnow that he has emancipated himself from the predatory law firms and his bankruptcy \nobligations, and his health has been restored, is now under control.  \nWork Performance and Character References \n \nThe current operations manager of the program in which Applicant works, noted \nthat Applicant\u2019s rise to his current position as group leader speaks strongly of his steadfast \ncharacter and dedication to the project. Applicant\u2019s continuous performance in the \nleadership role demonstrates dependability, accountability, dedication, and a firm \nfoundation of generally good characteristic traits such as trustworthiness and ability to \nlead peers.40 The modification associate manager of the program also referred to \nApplicant\u2019s dependability, accountability, and dedication, and he added that Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter and integrity have never been called into question.41 \n \n \n                                                          \n \n38 AE T (Press Release, dated May 18, 2015); AE U, supra note 3. \n \n39 AE W (Personal Financial Statement, dated April 30, 2019). \n \n40 AE R (Character Reference, dated April 23, 2019). \n \n41 AE S (Character Reference, dated April 23, 2019). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d42 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d43   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d44 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.45  \n \n                                                          \n42 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n43 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n44 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n45 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d46  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d47 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n                                                          \n46 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n47 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nSome of Applicant\u2019s accounts became delinquent, a vehicle was repossessed, and \nseveral accounts were charged off. Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in \n2014 and 2016, and on both occasions, the bankruptcy was dismissed because of \nApplicant\u2019s failure to furnish the bankruptcy trustee some required documentation related \nto his federal income tax refunds. The SOR identified seven purportedly delinquent \naccounts, totaling approximately $65,147. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established. \nAs there is no evidence that Applicant was unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of the \nability to do so, AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;48 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;49 and \n                                                          \n48 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n49 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) all apply. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties \noccurred as a result of major back surgery; his employer\u2019s rule that he could not return to \nwork until he was completely healed; and insufficient disability income to enable him to \nmake his routine monthly payments on all of his accounts. Applicant did not attempt to \nignore his creditors. Instead, he sought professional legal guidance that resulted in his \nbecoming a victim of consumer fraud according to three different states. His difficulties \nwere exacerbated by the predatory practices of some unscrupulous professional \norganizations from which he sought professional legal guidance, as well as the failure of \nthe bankruptcy trustee to disburse funds to Applicant\u2019s creditors. Those circumstances \nwere not only highly unusual, but largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Applicant naively \nfollowed the instructions of his attorneys, paying them rather than his creditors. Those \nattorneys apparently accomplished nothing in his behalf, or possibly did not even try to \ndo anything except collect his money. However, now that Applicant has cast aside those \nlaw firms, and removed himself from the bankruptcies, he contacted his creditors and \nstarted paying them directly. To date, his good-faith efforts have resulted in resolving five \nof the accounts by paying off four of them and proving that the fifth account was not his \nresponsibility. He is in the process of resolving the two remaining accounts by remaining \nin compliance with the repayment arrangements that were established with the creditors. \nApplicant\u2019s actions, under the circumstances, no longer cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.50 \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time.  \n                                                          \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n50 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.51  \n  \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Some of \nApplicant\u2019s accounts became delinquent, a vehicle was repossessed, and several \naccounts were charged off. Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 on two \noccasions, and each time, the bankruptcy was dismissed because of Applicant\u2019s failure \nto furnish the bankruptcy trustee some required documentation related to his federal \nincome tax refunds. Applicant had seven purportedly delinquent accounts, totaling \napproximately $65,147.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nsheet metal mechanic with his current employer since October 2014. A 1983 high school \ngraduate, he earned some college credits, but no degree. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. \nNavy in May 1984, and he was honorably retired as a petty officer first class (E-6) in May \n2004. During his military career, Applicant was deployed on several occasions to the \nEastern Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. He was awarded the Navy Sea Service \nDeployment Ribbon (four awards); and the Navy Battle \u201cE\u201d Ribbon (four awards). He was \ngranted a secret clearance in 1986, and it was renewed in 2005.  \n \nApplicant did not attempt to ignore his creditors. Instead, he sought professional \nlegal guidance that resulted in his becoming a victim of consumer fraud. Applicant naively \nfollowed the instructions of his attorneys, paying them rather than his creditors. However, \n                                                          \n51 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nnow that Applicant has cast aside those law firms, and removed himself from the \nbankruptcies, he contacted his creditors and started paying them directly. To date, his \ngood-faith efforts have resulted in resolving five of the accounts, and he in the process of \nresolving the two remaining accounts by remaining in compliance with the repayment \narrangements that were established with the creditors. Applicant\u2019s actions to restore fiscal \nstability on his own, without the bankruptcy court\u2019s assistance, and the interference of \nunscrupulous professional organizations, have been remarkable. His financial situation is \nnow under control. Under the circumstances, his actions no longer cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:52 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a strong track record of both debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, finally avoiding the predatory efforts of unscrupulous professional \norganizations who sought to fleece him rather than help him. Overall, the evidence leaves \nme without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for \na security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n                                                          \n52 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Applicant also admits he failed to file federal income \ntax returns for tax year 2016. (SOR \u00b6 1.w: Gov 4 at 2)    \n \n Applicant admits all of the debts. The student loans were private loans he took \nout to finance a master\u2019s program and his medical school. He began to encounter \nfinancial problems when he attended medical school. His wife filed for divorce when he \nwas in medical school. He made some student-loan payments while he was working as \na linguist, but stopped making payments in 2012 after he returned to the United States \nbecause he could not afford to make payments. Applicant earned $145,000 annually as \na linguist. He lost the position when the mission ended and the contract linguist staff \nwas reduced. (Tr. 45-47)  \n \nWhen Applicant returned to the United States he used money earned while \noverseas to purchase and remodel a house. He purchased the house for approximately \n$57,000 and spent between $160,000 to $180,000 remodeling the house. Applicant \nestimates the house is worth approximately $200,000. The house has no mortgage. \nApplicant testified that he currently earns below the poverty line and that he qualifies for \nMedicaid. In 2013, he earned less than $10,000.  He could not find a well-paying job. \nHe stayed at home to care for his mother from the summer 2014 to August 2017. He \nearned $300 a month caring for his mother. (Tr. 33-37; Gov 6)  \n \nWhen asked why he bought a house rather than pay off his student loan debts, \nApplicant replied: \n \nBecause I needed \u2013 if I would\u2019ve \u2013 see, it was just \u2013 I thought if just put \nthis money towards paying debt, I wouldn\u2019t have anything. And I thought if \nI could buy a house, I could have something to function from, like a \nheadquarters and go back to work. (Tr. 74)  \n \nApplicant has a side business of selling guitars on the Internet. He claims the \nmarket is slow and he has not made many sales because customers would like to \npurchase the guitars well below market prices. He estimates his guitar collection is \nworth $15,000.  He also purchased several Persian rugs when he was in Iraq with the \npurpose of selling the rugs in the U.S. He discovered that the market is saturated with \nPersian rugs and he would be unable to sell them for a profit. He also occasionally \nbought and sold cars. (Tr. 35, 71-73; Gov 6)  \n \nApplicant admits he did not file his federal income tax returns for tax year 2016. \nDuring the hearing, Applicant volunteered that the last time he filed his federal income \ntax returns was 2015. He did not file for tax year 2017. It is not clear whether Applicant \nis required to file an income tax return because of his low income. I considered this and \nalso considered that Applicant\u2019s failure to file his 2017 tax return was not alleged in the \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR. I will not consider it when applying the disqualifying factors. However, I will \nconsider it to assess Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation, when considering matters in \nmitigation, and when applying the whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant made payments towards the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.v for a \nwhile. After the hearing, he provided documents showing the current balance on the \nloans to be $4,791 and $18,472. Applicant consolidated these loans with his former wife \nwhen they were still married. (AE B; AE C, tab 3) Applicant paid another student loan off \nin full. This loan was not alleged in the SOR. (AE A, AE C, tab 1) Applicant has not \nattended formal financial counseling. (Tr. 75) \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided statements from his private student-loan \ncreditor indicating that the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \u2013 1.f are no longer being \ncollected because the statute of limitations expired for each of these loans. Applicant \nmay receive a Form 1099 for this forgiveness. (AE D) There is one remaining student \nloan with this creditor with a balance of $31,776. (SOR \u00b6 1.d)   \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct: \n \n \nUnder Personal Conduct, Applicant\u2019s is alleged to have falsified his answers to \nseveral questions regarding his financial situation on his e-QIP application which was \nsigned by him on July 12, 2017. In response to \u201cSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 \nDelinquency Involving Enforcement \u2013 Other than previously listed, have any of the \nfollowing happened to you? . . . . In the past seven (7) years, you had had a judgment \nentered against you?\u201d  Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d  He did not list the two judgments \nentered against him in 2016 which are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. (Gov 1)  \n \nApplicant also answered, \u201cNo\u201d in response to the \u201cSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record \n\u2013 Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts \u2013 Other than previously listed, have any of \nthe following happened? . . . .

In the \npast seven (7) years, you defaulted on any type of loan? . . . . In the past seven (7) \nyears you had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency? . . . . In the past seven \n(7) years, you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for \nfailing to pay as agreed? . . . . In the past seven (7) years you have been over 120 days \ndelinquent on any debt not previously entered?\u201d  Applicant did not list any of the \ndelinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.u.   \n \nApplicant testified that he is not sure why he did not list his judgments and \ndelinquent debts on his e-QIP.  He said his failure to answer, \u201cYes\u201d could have been a \nmistake, or possibly he did not understand what the questions meant. He must have \noverlooked the question regarding judgments. His failure to list his 2016 judgments was \nnot deliberate.  Applicant testified that he did not understand what was meant by \n\u201cjudgment\u201d. He admits that he appeared at trial regarding the judgment alleged in SOR \n\n \n5 \n \n \n\u00b6 1.b, but understood that he and the attorney settled the matter before judgment. (Tr. \n63-66) \n \nApplicant admits that he had debts that delinquent for more than 120 days when \nhe completed the e-QIP. He is not sure why he answered, \u201cNo\u201d to the questions under \nSection 26 \u2013 Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts. (Tr. 66-69)  \n \nWhole-Person Factors:   \n \nApplicant submitted certificates and awards related to his honorable military \nservice in the US Air Force; documents related to his medical school training and \neducation to include favorable reference letters; and certificates of appreciation related \nto his service as a contract linguist in Iraq. (AE C, Tabs 2 and 4)   \n \nApplicant does not understand why his poor financial situation would raise a \nsecurity concern. He believes he has demonstrated his loyalty by serving honorably in \nthe US Air Force, and by handling classified information without incident as a linguist in \nIraq. He assumed that since he was granted a security clearance in the past, his \nsecurity clearance should continue. He intends to pay his debts once he finds a well-\npaying job. (Answer to SOR)    \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. He incurred approximately \n$169,892 in delinquent student loans. Three judgments were entered against him, an \napproximate total of $9,659.  He also has 12 delinquent consumer accounts, an \napproximate total of $22,267. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  Although Applicant \nadmitted to not filing his 2016 federal income tax return, there is insufficient evidence in \nthe record to show that he earned enough income to require the filing of a federal tax \nreturn. I find AG \u00b6 19(f) does not apply and find SOR \u00b6 1.w for Applicant.  \n  \n \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. \nHe has a history of not meeting his financial obligations since at least 2012 when he \nwas laid off from his overseas linguist position. Instead of looking for additional \nemployment, he stopped working and lived off credit cards. Most of the accounts are \nnow delinquent. Applicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility continues to raise questions about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, because Applicant claims that he could not work \nwhen he returned from Iraq in 2012, because he had to care for his mother who had \ndementia, which could be considered a circumstance beyond his control.  However, the \ndecision to remain unemployed was Applicant\u2019s choice. Other options could have been \npursued to care for his mother, such as adult daycare. Applicant\u2019s father and siblings \nlived in the area. They could have helped care for her. Regardless, I cannot conclude \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances because he chose to purchase a \nhouse with the money he earned while working overseas while ignoring his student \nloans and other delinquent debts. For this reason, AG \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight.  \n \n \nAG & 20(d) does not apply. I cannot conclude that Applicant made a good-faith \neffort to resolve his delinquent debts.  He entered into a payment plan regarding the \nstudent loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.v and resolved one student loan that was not alleged in \nthe SOR, but has ignored his other delinquent accounts. He provided evidence that six \nof his student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e -1.i) are no longer collectible because the statute of \nlimitations has passed.  However, the DOHA Appeal Board has long held that passively \nwaiting for debts to pass the statute of limitations to pass is not a good-faith effort to \nresolve one\u2019s debts. \u201cReliance on the non-collectability of a debt does not constitute a \ngood-faith effort to resolve that debt within the meaning of the Directive.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 07-06841 at 4. App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2008) Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his student loans \nand other debts is further aggravated by the fact that he purchased and remodeled a \nhome instead of paying his debts.  \n \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under Financial \nConsiderations.  \n \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes.  \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security \nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nand \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies with regard to Applicant\u2019s omission of his unpaid judgments  \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a and his deliberate omission of his delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 2.b. Applicant\u2019s explanation for not listing his financial delinquencies on his security \nclearance application was not credible. He admits to being aware of the judgments, and \nadmits he lived off credit cards during the past seven years while he was \nunderemployed. Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his unpaid judgments and delinquent \naccounts on his e-QIP application raises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, \nreliability, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. This raises questions \nabout Applicant\u2019s ability to handle classified information.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating conditions potentially apply in \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \n \n \nNeither mitigating condition applies. Applicant did not make a prompt, good-faith \neffort to correct his omitted financial delinquencies.  His deliberate omission of his \ndelinquent accounts on his security clearance application was serious and raised \nquestions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.     \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n       I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service as well his past employment as a linguist in an overseas location. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s period of unemployment and underemployment while caring for \nhis mother who suffered from dementia. However, he should have known that he \nneeded to be suitably employed in order to pay his bills. Applicant ignored his student \nloans while purchasing and remodeling a house with the cash he earned while working \noverseas as a linguist. He has a significant amount of delinquent debt and has made no \nattempt to resolve any of his accounts. He promises to pay off his debts in the future \nonce he gets a suitable job. A promise to pay in the future does not demonstrate a \ngood-faith effort to resolve one\u2019s financial situation and is not a substitute for a track \nrecord of paying debts in a timely manner. (ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. \nSep. 19, 2008). I also considered Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his judgments and \ndelinquent accounts on his July 2017 e-QIP application. Applicant\u2019s financial situation is \nunstable and it is unlikely to improve in the near future. Questions remain about \nApplicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness \nand \nreliability. \nSecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nfinancial \nconsiderations and personal conduct are not mitigated.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.v: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:   \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 28, \n2017. On July 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B, foreign influence, Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n12/18/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant obtained counsel and answered the SOR on August 15, 2018, \nadmitting all of the SOR allegations under Guideline B, foreign influence, and Guideline \nJ, criminal conduct. He denied the two SOR allegations of falsification under Guideline \nE at SOR \u00b6 3.b and \u00b6 3.c. Applicant also requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. The case was assigned to me on October 15, 2018. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nNovember 6, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 - 12 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified, and he submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 N, \nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November \n15, 2018.  \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted formal requests that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq and Turkey. Applicant did not object and the requests \nwere approved.

Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).  \n \nApplicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the HE 1 source documents, and incorporated them by reference. The \nfacts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated in this decision. \nHowever, of particular note, are the following salient facts from HE 1: \n \n\n \n3 \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The U.S. State Department warns \nthat U.S. citizens traveling in Iraq remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist \nviolence and to avoid all but essential travel to Iraq. The Islamic State of Iraq and the \nLevant (ISIL) controls a significant portion of Iraq\u2019s territory. Within areas under ISIL \ncontrol, the Iraq government has little or no ability to exercise control and ensure public \nsafety. Kidnappings and attacks by improvised explosive devices (IED\u2019s) occur \nfrequently in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Such attacks often take \nplace in public venues such as cafes and markets.  \n \nAnti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies \nthroughout Iraq. Iraq witnessed a continuing surge of terrorist activity in 2016, primarily \nas a result of the actions of ISIL. Although the government of Iraq has made significant \nprogress in its campaign to retake occupied territory from ISIL, there remains a security \nvacuum in parts of Iraq. The U.S. State Department has also reported that ISIL \ncommitted the overwhelming number of significant human rights abuses, including \nattacks against civilians, especially Shia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL, and women \nand children. ISIL members committed acts of violence on a mass scale, including \nkillings by suicide bombings, IED\u2019s, execution-style shootings, public beheadings, and \nother forms of execution. Sectarian hostility, widespread corruption, and lack of \ntransparency at all levels, weakened the Iraq government\u2019s authority and worsened \neffective human rights protections. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice - Turkey \n \nThe request listed supporting documents to show detail and context for those \nfacts. A risk assessment in this case necessitates administrative notice of facts \nconcerning Turkey.  \n \nApplicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the HE 2 source documents, and incorporated them by reference. The \nfacts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated in this decision. \nHowever, of particular note, are the following salient facts from HE 2: \n \nNotwithstanding the long strategic U.S. \u2013 Turkey relationship, current country \nconditions are problematic.  The U.S. State Department urges citizens to avoid travel to \nTurkey due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. Terrorist groups explicitly target \nWestern tourists and expatriates for kidnapping and assassination. The potential for \nterrorist attacks in Turkey, including against U.S. citizens and interests, remains high. \nThe U.S. Government does not allow family members to accompany personnel \nassigned to the U.S. Consulate in Adana, unless they are working in the Consulate. \nTurkey is a transit country for foreign terrorist fighters wishing to join the Islamic State of \nIraq and Syria (ISIS) and other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq. Since a July \n2016 coup attempt, the Turkish Government has operated under a state of emergency, \nwith far reaching effects on the country\u2019s society and institutions, restricting the exercise \nof many fundamental freedoms. Profound and significant human rights abuses persist.    \n \n\n \n4 \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old and single. He reports no children. He was born in \nBaghdad, Iraq and he served as a linguist for a federal contractor attached to armed \nforces of the United States from 2003 to 2009. (GE 1, Tr. 15, 35) He went on more than \n1,000 combat patrols. (Tr. 86) Applicant has one brother, age 30, who served as a \nlinguist in support of U.S. Marines in Iraq for five years. (Tr. 36) He also has three \nsisters still living in different cities in Iraq with their husbands and families. Their ages \nare 31, 39, and 42. Applicant\u2019s parents moved from Iraq to Syria in 2005 and remained \nfor three years. (Tr. 38-39) Next, they moved to Turkey due to the instability in Syria. \nApplicant moved to the U.S. in 2009 on a special immigrant visa program and he was \nnaturalized in 2014. (Tr. 15)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother served in the Ministry of Education in Iraq for 22 years, and \nhis father retired from the Iraqi Army as a major in 1989-\u201990, after more than 20 years of \nservice.  (Tr. 30-31) Applicant provided financial support of $250, once a month from \n2010-2016, to his parents for such things as medical bills. (Tr. 39) They are refugees \nresiding in Turkey. Applicant has telephonic contact with his parents once or twice a \nweek. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant has filed an application with the Embassy in Turkey to try to \nmove them to the U.S. on a visa. His brother tutors school children in Iraq. They last \nhad contact more than three years ago. (Tr. 43) Applicant\u2019s two oldest sisters are \nteachers in Iraq and his youngest sister never worked. (Tr. 44) In addition to providing \nfinancial support to his parents, as needed, Applicant gave his youngest sister $900 to \nhelp her buy a car. (Tr. 45) His telephonic contact with his sisters varies from once \nevery two weeks to once a month. He has no property in Iraq, and held a bank account \nthere briefly from 2008-2009. (Tr. 89)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 28, \n2017.2 In section 22 (Police Record) of his SCA, he answered \u201cno\u201d to all questions \nabout being issued any summons, citations, tickets to appear in court in a criminal \nproceeding etc. Applicant failed to disclose the civil summons, 4 criminal summonses, \n25 citations and 18 traffic warnings that he received between November 2010 and \nSeptember 2016. (GE 4-11) He admitted all of these traffic violations in his Answer. \nApplicant submitted AE A, an updated state division of motor vehicles driving record, to \nshow that he has not had any vehicle violations since 2015. Applicant testified credibly \nthat he may have misinterpreted the questions in this section of the SCA but since all of \nhis citations involved fines of less than $300, he was not required to report them. (Tr. \n82) Since all of the charges against him alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a\u20132.e were dismissed and \nApplicant served no community service, paid no fines, and had no consequences, he \nmisunderstood and believed he did not have to report these in his SCA. (Tr. 83) To \ncorroborate his testimony on this point, he did disclose his arrest for domestic violence \n                                                          \n1 Unless otherwise stated, the basis for these findings of fact is Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SCA) dated February 28, 2017 (GE 1) and the summaries of personal subject \ninterviews conducted on July 27, 2017, and December 8, 2017. (GE 2) \n \n2 GE 1. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nin 2015 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and protective order against him, as well as the arrest for \ncommunicating threats in 2016, to the clearance investigator in his December 8, 2017 \nclearance interview. (GE 2, Tr. 117) He disclosed this offense because it is the only one \nwhere he went to trial.  \n \n \nIn September 2011, Applicant lived with his girlfriend. They had a disagreement \nand when he tried to move out, she gave him only half of his personal property. (Tr. 58) \nShe tried to shove him out the door and he allegedly pushed her. The judge dismissed \nthis complaint at SOR \u00b6 2.a. (Tr. 58) In SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant lent $250 to a female co-\nworker who was in financial distress in January 2015. He asked her for a check to \nsecure this loan, which he would only cash after she became solvent. (Tr. 60-63) When \nhe later tried to cash the check, he found that there were insufficient funds in her \naccount and confronted her. She tried to snatch the cold check out of his hand and \ncalled police. He was charged with trespassing and the judge summarily dismissed that \ncomplaint and had her arrested for uttering a false instrument. (Tr. 63) In August 2015, \na mentally ill neighbor alleged that Applicant committed simple assault, but promptly \ndropped the charges. (GE 6, Tr. 63) Again, Applicant was arrested for communicating \nthreats against a former business partner in March 2016, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and \nthat charge was dismissed by the judge on May 16, 2016. (GE 8)   \n \n \nApplicant obtained his commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) and operated a \ntransportation company from 2013-2017. (Tr. 52) He received numerous citations for \ndriving infractions during that period. (Tr. 55) Applicant testified that he started driving in \nIraq when he was 14 years old, and he was accustomed to driving unimpeded by \nrestrictions on speed, and rules and regulations. (Tr. 75) He had difficulty assimilating to \nthe rules of the road and driving laws when he moved to the U.S. at age 28. Although \nhe studied a safe driving booklet, passed a written exam, and took a state road test to \nobtain his state driver\u2019s license in 2009, he had a habit of speeding. (GE 9, 10, 11, Tr. \n77)  \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly that despite his astonishing number of driving \noffenses, his state license was never suspended, and it is still valid. (Tr. 80, AE A) \nInstead, he would routinely hire an attorney who would go into state court and get the \ndriving offense reduced to improper equipment (odometer), and pay a fine \u2013 25 times. \n(Tr. 79) Despite this ruse, Applicant was aware that the problem was not a defective \nodometer. (Tr. 123) Applicant admitted that he took too long to change his driving \nhabits, but he did so. (Tr. 79) He was recently issued a warning in 2018 because he \nwas driving his girlfriend\u2019s car, which had an improperly displayed license plate. (Tr. 96) \n \n \nApplicant was involved in a civil dispute with one of his former employee-truck \ndrivers, after that driver abandoned one of his trucks and left it unattended. (Tr. 12, GE \n7) He was charged with simple assault on the other CDL driver in August 2015 at SOR \n\u00b6 2.d. The state court judge dismissed this criminal complaint against Applicant on \nSeptember 28, 2015. (GE 7) Then, a civil action ensued between Applicant and the \nsame driver for $4,500 that Applicant loaned the driver. It was resolved for $4,500 in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. (Tr. 72) Applicant reasonably stated that he had no reason to report \nthis civil action in his favor, in his SCA, and he did not intend to falsify that form or \n\n \n6 \n \ndeceive the government as alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c because this is all a matter of public \ncourt records. (Tr. 114, 118, GE 7,12)   \n \n \nApplicant submitted AE B\u2013K, which are character reference letters, and AE L-N, \nwhich are certificates of appreciation for his service as a linguist on behalf of U.S. \nArmed Forces. Notably, he served coalition forces with bravery and distinction since \n2006. An Army Brigadier General stated \u201cservice of local national translators who risk \ntheir safety, and that of their families, to support the mission and U.S. soldiers, is \ninvaluable.\u201d (AE B) Applicant was first employed by the U.S. military as a general \nlaborer in 2004 in Iraq. Then, he served in direct support of combat units including the \n82nd Airborne Division, and 2nd and 3rd Brigade Combat Teams, 4th Infantry Division, as \nan Arabic translator. He performed so well that he was added to Army civil action teams \nin 2008. (AE C-N)   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \n7 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are living in Turkey, but applied for visas to immigrate to the \nU.S. His brother and sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. He provides occasional \nfinancial support to his parents as a dutiful son. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a \npotential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly and through his family members. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are implicated by the evidence. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s relationship \n\n \n8 \n \nwith his parents and siblings, who are citizens and residents of Turkey and Iraq, creates \na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion.  \n \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a long-standing preference for working and living in \nthe U.S. He served in harm\u2019s way as a linguist for over six years and endured over \n1,000 patrols with U.S. Armed Forces. He was hired as a linguist precisely because of \nhis Arabic language skills that are indigenous to people who were born and raised \nand have family in Iraq. He has the background, upbringing, and understanding of Iraqi \nculture that is invaluable. Although he is presumed to have strong bonds of affection \nwith his parents and siblings in Turkey and Iraq, these bonds are not sufficient to offset \nor overcome his demonstrated, long-term commitment to the U.S. and self-abnegation \nin its service under dangerous conditions.3  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States:  \n \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.4  \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the U.S. over \n                                                          \n3 The Appeal Board has held that \u201can Applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense of the United States \nis very important and can lead to a favorable result for an Applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case \n04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. March 20, 2007). \n4 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially \nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing whether \nan applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S., or \nthe foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant parents are Iraqi citizens residing in Turkey, and his siblings are \ncitizens and residents of Iraq, which is an unstable regime. His contact with them is \ninfrequent by telephone. There is no indication that they are affiliated with the Iraqi \ngovernment or intelligence services. Applicant\u2019s foreign family members do not pose an \nunacceptable security risk. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant would \nreport contacts with his relatives by foreign intelligence agents, and that he has a long-\nterm commitment to the U.S. All of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 8 are applicable to \nthe contacts with family members, which are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.b.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be dis- \nqualifying including: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin combination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted. \n \nApplicant admitted to 25 traffic citations, and 18 warnings between 2010 and \n2016. However, traffic violations generally don\u2019t rise to the level of criminality. Although \nhe repeatedly violated state traffic regulations and admits that it took too long for him to \nalter his behavior, there is no evidence of criminality. This same aberrant behavior is \nproperly cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a. The criminal summonses issued against Applicant \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.e were all dismissed or resolved in his favor.  Thus, AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n31(a) and (b) do not apply.  \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n           The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nThe Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure \nto cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. The following normally will \nresult in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to meeting \nwith a security investigator for subject interview, completing security \nforms or releases, cooperation with medical or psychological \nevaluation, or polygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n \n \nb) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions \nof investigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n     \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \n\n \n11 \n \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified information. This \nincludes but is not limited to, considerations of: \n \n   \n \n  (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \nApplicant did not disclose his extraordinary involvement and frequent interaction \nwith authorities in law enforcement and the U.S. judicial system over the last decade in \nhis SCA. He has a well-established pattern of speeding and failure to comply with traffic \nrules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) (c) and (d) are implicated and the focus shifts to a \ndetermination of which, if any of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n17. Conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n            Applicant\u2019s traffic violations were frequent and numerous. His last offense \noccurred in  2018 when he was driving his girlfriend\u2019s vehicle, and received a warning \nbecause  the vehicle lacked a proper license plate. It is premature to conclude that \nhis aberrant driving behavior is unlikely to recur. Thus, the cross-alleged 25 citations \nand 18 warnings at SOR \u00b6 3.a, while not rising to criminality, do support a whole-\nperson assessment of unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. This \nallegation, insofar as it cross-alleges driving offenses improperly alleged under \nGuideline J, at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f \u2013 2.h, is not mitigated here under Guideline E. The sheer \nnumber of repeated driving offenses, when combined with all available information, \nraises concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.  \n \nApplicant misunderstood the questions in the SCA in section 28 about being \na party to any civil court actions in the last 10 years. He testified credibly that he was \nthe successful plaintiff in a civil dispute and multiple summonses were dismissed \nagainst him. His contention that he felt no reason to disclose these matters of public \nrecord, in his SCA, is not unreasonable. He naturally assumed that since his \nextensive list of infractions all involved fines of less than $300 he did not have to \nreport these on his SCA. I find that he did not have the specific intent to deliberately \ndeceive the government or falsify his SCA. His failures to disclose these infractions \nand civil disputes as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 3.d, have no national security \nsignificance or concern. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines B, E, and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline. Applicant is 37 years old. He submitted \ncharacter references from his supervisors attesting to his allegiance to the U.S. Virtually \nall of his adult work life was spent in Iraq supporting U.S. interests. However, he is still \nin the process of assimilating successfully into his new country, and learning to comply \nwith driving laws.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has  \nmitigated foreign influence security concerns, and criminal conduct security concerns, \nbut not personal conduct security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n                      Paragraph 1, Guideline B:                         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:                             For Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n  FOR APPLICANT \n \n\n \n13 \n \n                      Subparagraphs 2.a-2.h:                             For Applicant \n \n                      Paragraph 3, Guideline E:                         AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n                      Subparagraph 3.a                                      Against Applicant  \n \n                      Subparagraphs 3.b-3.c:                             For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n ________________________ \n \n \n \n \n      Robert J.

He has been employed by a defense contractor since April 2014, and is seeking to continue the security clearance he has held since 2007 during his employment with several defense contractors.

De Angelis, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n06/06/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant owed more than $38,500 in delinquent consumer debts. He settled one \nsmall credit card account for 45% of the balance due, but demonstrated insufficient efforts \nor means to resolve his remaining delinquencies or establish rehabilitation. Resulting \nsecurity concerns were not mitigated. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, \nnational security eligibility is denied.  \nStatement of Case \nOn March 2, 2017, Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP). (Item 4.) On June 18, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline F: Financial Considerations. (Item 1.) \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, that became \neffective for all Executive Branch agencies on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 6, 2018, and requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 3.) \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), containing eight Items. A complete copy of the FORM was mailed to Applicant \non October 24, 2018, and received by him on November 1, 2018. The FORM notified \nApplicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant requested \nan extension of time to submit his written FORM response until December 17, 2018, and \nthat extension was granted by Department Counsel. Applicant did not submit any other \nmaterial in response to the FORM, did not file any objection to its contents, and did not \nrequest additional time to respond beyond the extended deadline of December 17, 2018. \nItems 1 through 8 are admitted in evidence. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and married, with twin children who were born in January \n2014. He earned a high school diploma in May 1998, and a bachelor\u2019s degree from an \nonline university in May 2015. He has been employed by a defense contractor since April \n2014, and is seeking to continue the security clearance he has held since 2007 during his \nemployment with several defense contractors. He was honorably discharged in February \n2007, after serving for almost eight years in the Marine Corps Reserve. (Item 4.)  \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the four delinquent credit card and consumer loan debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. These unpaid accounts totaled $23,361; were \nopened by Applicant between September 2014 and March 2015; and became delinquent \nin 2016 or early 2017. (Items 3, 4, 5, 7.) \n \n \nThe fifth SOR-alleged debt (\u00b6 1.b) involved a contract that Applicant signed in \nMarch 2015 for a loan to purchase a car. He denied responsibility for repayment of the \nloan because, on some unspecified date, another person had \u201cestablished a simple \ncontract\u201d with him to take possession of the car and make the remaining loan payments. \nApplicant asserted that this undocumented agreement absolved him of his contractual \nresponsibility to the seller. However, the other person stopped making the loan payments \nin May 2016, then returned to live with his family in Mexico. The accident-damaged car \nwas eventually located by the lender and repossessed. Applicant offered no evidence \nthat the creditor, from whom he borrowed money to buy the car, agreed to absolve him \nof his contractual obligations. The charged-off past-due balance of $15,231 remains \nunresolved and actively listed on Appellant\u2019s most recent credit report. (Items 3, 5, 7.)  \n \n \nOn July 5, 2018, the day before submitting his response to the SOR, Applicant \nmade a payment of $608.68 to the collection agency that had acquired the charged-off \ndelinquent $1,352 credit card debt from his original major-bank creditor. Applicant opened \nthis account in January 2015, and stopped making his required payments in September \n2015. The collection agency accepted Applicant\u2019s partial payment in full satisfaction of \nthe debt, which was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. This debt is now resolved. (Items 1, 3, 5, 7.) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquencies to financial strains arising out of his \nNovember 2014 marital separation. However, he failed to describe or document any \ncausal relationship between that separation and the debts. He opened the largest \nunsecured personal loan debt ($17,149 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a) in December 2014, which \nwas after the separation had already occurred. His second largest delinquency (the \n$15,231 charged-off car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b) was opened in March 2015, some \nfour months after the separation. On his March 2, 2017 e-QIP, Applicant reported his \nmarital status as, \u201cSeparated,\u201d since, \u201c11/11/2014 (Estimated).\u201d However, he also \nreported that he had resided in the home he owns since June 2010, which has the same \naddress at which he reported his wife and two children were then living. Applicant \nprovided no evidence of extra expenses from maintaining separate residences, of other \ncosts beyond his control, or of reasonable action to manage such issues. (Item 3.)   \n \n \nApplicant did not document any financial counseling. He did not submit budgetary \nincome or expense figures from which to analyze his future ability to meet family living \nexpenses while resolving his delinquencies. Applicant offered no evidence concerning \nthe level of responsibility his duties entail in his defense contractor work, or his track \nrecord with respect to handling sensitive information and observation of security \nprocedures. I was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person, \nsince he elected to have his case decided without a hearing.  \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred more than $38,500 in consumer debts in late 2014 and 2015 \nthat he stopped paying in 2016 and 2017, despite earning his regular income during and \nsince this period. He provided insufficient explanation or financial information to clarify \nwhether this irresponsibility stemmed from inability or unwillingness to pay these \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nvoluntarily assumed obligations These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the \nresulting security concerns.  \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt over the past five years is substantial, and \nhis financial irresponsibility is ongoing. His failure to demonstrate substantial progress \ntoward resolving four of the SOR-alleged debts in a meaningful way creates ongoing \nconcerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. He offered no reasonable \nbasis to conclude that such problems will not continue or recur. Mitigation was not \nestablished under AG \u00b6 20(a). \n  \nApplicant did not show that either his temporary marital separation or his \ndelinquent debts arose from circumstances beyond his control. Nor did he demonstrate \nthat he acted responsibly under such circumstances, as required for mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 20(b).  \nApplicant offered no evidence of financial counseling or budget information \nestablishing his solvency going forward. He failed to demonstrate that these problems, in \naggregate, are being brought under control; or that a good-faith effort toward resolution \nhas actually been undertaken. After receiving the SOR, he spent $608.68 to settle a \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \ndelinquent credit card debt of $1,352. That debt is mitigated. His attempt to dispute his \nongoing liability for the car loan he opened in 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was neither reasonable \nnor substantiated by any documentation. Whether believed or not, this proffered \nexplanation casts serious doubt on Applicant\u2019s judgment in either event. Accordingly, he \ndid not establish meaningful mitigation of the security concerns under the provisions of \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), or 20(e). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nis accountable for his choices. He continues to owe more than $37,000 in delinquent debt, \nand has no meaningful track record of being able to resolve them or avoid new problems. \nThe potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished, and \nrehabilitation was not demonstrated. Overall, the evidence creates significant doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He failed \nto meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the Financial \nConsiderations guideline. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n      \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

National security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Statement of the Case \n \n \nOn April 4, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). On \nAugust 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 15, 2018. She provided five documents \nwith her response, and she admitted all of the SOR allegations. Applicant requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On February 28, 2019, the case was assigned \n\n \n2 \n \n \nto me. On March 4, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing, setting the hearing for March 19, 2019.  \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibit (GE) 1-4, \nwhich I admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant did not provide additional \ndocumentation at the hearing. The five documents attached to her SOR response were \nmarked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-E, which I admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and called her father to testify on her behalf. I held the record open \nuntil April 19, 2019, in the event either party wanted to submit additional documentation. \nNo additional documents were received. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nApril 1, 2019, and the record was closed on April 19, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  Applicant is 32 years old. She earned some college credits, but did not \nearn enough for a college degree. She married in 2016, and is the mother of a young \ndaughter born in July 2018. She has been employed by a DOD contractor since \nFebruary 2017. She does not currently possess a DOD security clearance, but her \nemployer is sponsoring her for a security clearance in order that she may perform \nspecific employment duties. (Tr. 5, 12-14, 36-38; GE 1) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant falsified material facts when she \ncompleted her SCA in April 2017. In response to Section 13A \u2013 she listed employment \nwith a department store, but she deliberately failed to disclose that she was terminated \nby her employer for tardiness in about January 2011. Instead, she listed her reason for \nleaving this employment was because she had to care for her sister. Applicant admitted \nthis allegation in her SOR response. During the hearing, she stated that she was \nashamed about being fired from an employer. She did not list accurate information on \nthe SCA purely out of embarrassment. (Tr. 14-17; GE 1, GE 2) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.b alleges that that Applicant falsified material facts when she \ncompleted her SCA in April 2017. Specifically, in response to Section 22, she denied \nthat she had \u201cEVER\u201d been charged with an offense involving drugs or alcohol. She \nadmitted this allegation in her response to the SOR, but denied that she intentionally \nomitted the adverse information from the SCA. Applicant claimed that she knew her \ndriver\u2019s license had been suspended, but she did not recall that she was also charged \nwith open container at the time of her arrest. (GE 1) \n \nThe Government records show that in 2010, Applicant was stopped by police for \na traffic infraction, when the police officer noticed an open container of alcohol in the \ncar. Applicant admitted the open container of alcohol was hers, but stated she had been \ndrinking it three hours earlier and forgot that she had it in her car. Applicant was \narrested and charged with driving while license suspended, and transporting an open \ncontainer of alcohol. At the hearing, Applicant stated that she had completely forgotten \nabout the open container incident. She only remembered being arrested for driving with \n\n \n3 \n \n \na suspended license. She also denied that the alcohol in the car was hers. When \nconfronted with her admission in the police report, Applicant claimed that she did not \nrecall telling a police officer that the alcohol was hers. It was her contention that the \npolice report was inaccurate. (Tr. 17-21; GE 4) \n \nIn March 2018, during Applicant\u2019s background interview with an authorized DOD \ninvestigator, she was confronted with her 2010 arrest, in part, for open container. \nApplicant denied all knowledge of this charge, despite the fact that she spent [or \n\u201cdespite spending\u201d] one night in detention. In July 2018, she adopted the report of her \nbackground interview as being accurate, after making several changes. She denied any \nknowledge that she had been charged with an alcohol-related offense. At the hearing, \nApplicant claimed the alcohol belonged to another passenger in the car. Since she was \nthe driver, she was charged with the open container violation. Applicant stated that she \nwas under stress during the interview because she was pregnant at the time. She \nclaimed that her failure to report this information on her SCA was due to oversight. (Tr. \n9-10, 18-22, 34-35; GE 2)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant intentionally failed to disclose on her April 2017 \nSCA, under Section 26, that a 2011 civil judgment had been filed against her. She \nadmitted this hospital bill, which subsequently resulted in a judgment, but her mother \nlater told her the judgment actually belonged to someone else. Applicant provided a \ndocument with her SOR response which showed this judgment was dismissed in April \n2012. Applicant said it was not her intent to conceal or falsify her SCA regarding the civil \njudgment. During her March 2018 background interview, Applicant told the investigator \nthat her mother was disputing the hospital bill. She did not mention that the judgment \nhad been dismissed. She told the investigator that she made no attempt to pay the bill \nand could provide no documentation regarding the judgment. (Tr. 22-27; AE B) \n \n   SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant intentionally failed to disclose required information \non her April 2017 SCA, under Section 26, which asked if she had ever defaulted on a \nloan, or if she was currently 120 days or more delinquent on any debts. In her SOR \nresponse, she admitted this allegation, but she could not recall why she failed to \ndisclose her four delinquent student loans. Since the birth of her daughter, Applicant \nclaimed to have set up payment arrangements for her student loans. During her March \n2018 background interview, Applicant was confronted with her adverse financial \ninformation by the investigator. She stated that she did not list her civil judgment and \nunpaid student loans on the SCA because she was embarrassed. At the hearing, \nApplicant admitted she had reviewed her credit report at the time she filled out the SCA. \nShe was confused since some credit reports reflected the judgment and delinquent \nstudent loans, but she claimed other credit reports did not. Applicant admitted that she \ndid not continue her student loan payments due to other current financial obligations \nshe is trying to resolve. She did remember telling the investigator that she was \nembarrassed about the judgment and delinquent student loans. (Tr. 28-34; GE 1, GE 2) \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified her 2017 SCA when she failed to disclose her job \ntermination, her alcohol-related offense, and her adverse financial information. She did \nnot voluntarily provide this information during her background interview until she was \nconfronted with the derogatory information by the investigator. Applicant has provided \ninconsistent accounts as to why this information was not disclosed. She asserted that \nshe did not remember her arrest included a charge of open container of alcohol when \nshe filled out the security application. The above disqualifying condition applies. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \n \nI have considered all the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s testimony. I also \nconsidered her motive for falsifying the April 2017 SCA. She had been newly hired by \nthe DOD contractor in February 2017. She was embarrassed by the adverse \ninformation she was required to disclose. I considered her claim that she had forgotten \nthe open container incident, despite being arrested and spending a night in jail, and the \ninherent improbability that she would forget such a significant event. I did not find \nApplicant\u2019s explanations credible. She did not made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct \nomissions or falsifications during her background interview. Applicant admitted to the \ninvestigator the reason she did not list her job termination and adverse credit was due to \nembarrassment. She demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty, which casts doubt on her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. After reviewing her history of \ndeceit, I cannot conclude her dishonest behavior is unlikely to recur. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. This SOR highlights conduct that provides insight \n\n \n7 \n \n \nto a person\u2019s character and integrity. Applicant falsified her SCA because she was \nembarrassed. Intentionally omitting or falsifying relevant information to conceal \nderogatory information from a security application out of embarrassment, or even fear of \nmaintaining employment, does not mitigate falsification. Applicant failed to mitigate the \npersonal conduct security concerns. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden \nof showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n      Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is \ngranted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guidelines B and E. On January 10, 2019, Applicant \nresponded to the SOR through counsel, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  \n \nOn March 20, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On March 27, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, scheduling \nthe hearing for April 30, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and called one witness. Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through W were admitted \nwithout objection. On May 13, 2019, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). \n\n \n2 \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Iran. Applicant did not object to the request, and it was approved. The request \nand the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The facts are summarized in the written request and \nwill not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that the U.S. \nGovernment has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. It conducts cyber \nespionage and attacks, and more traditional espionage against U.S. interests and allies. \nIt does not recognize Israel and has hindered the Middle East peace process, including \nin Syria. It has a dismal human rights record. Iran does not recognize dual nationality \nand will treat U.S.-Iranian dual nationals solely as Iranian citizens subject to Iranian \nlaws. U.S.-Iranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter or depart Iran \nusing their U.S. passports. U.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed \nby the Iranian government. Iranian security personnel may place Iranian citizens and \nforeign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones and fax machines may be \nmonitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nBackground Information \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old radiologist, who has been employed since September \n2016 as a contract physician at a major military hospital. He seeks a position of trust as \na condition of his continued employment. (Tr. 32-34, 42, 46-48, 98-99)  \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1982. He subsequently earned \nseveral degrees: (1) a bachelor of science degree in physics, minoring in biology and \nmathematics, in June 1987; (2) a master\u2019s degree in physics in March 1989; (3) a \nPh.D.in physics in December 1994; and (4) a joint degree \u2013 J.D. in December 1998 and \nM.D. in May 2002. All of Applicant\u2019s education, discussed above, took place in the \nUnited States. Applicant completed two residency programs and two fellowship \nprograms at prestigious hospitals in the United States. He has active licenses to \npractice medicine in five states, an inactive license to practice medicine in one state, \nand active licenses to practice law in two states. (Tr. 35-42; AE C, AE L, AE R, AE S)  \n \n \nApplicant was married from June 2000 to November 2003, and that marriage \nended by divorce. He remarried in April 2014. Both spouses are U.S.-born citizens. (Tr. \n43, 105-106; GE 1) Applicant has three minor sons, all of whom are U.S.-born citizens. \nHis oldest son was born while he was married to his first wife, and two younger sons \nwere born while he was married to his second and current wife. Applicant\u2019s wife is not \nemployed outside the home. At the time Applicant met his wife, she was employed as a \ngrant analyst at a major university. (Tr. 43-45) \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iran to Iranian parents. In September 1978, at age 12, he \nimmigrated to the United States, along with his two older brothers, because of political \ninstability in Iran. Since then, he has never returned to Iran. Initially Applicant and his \nbrothers lived with their uncle (mother\u2019s brother), who was an active duty U.S. Navy \ndoctor. Applicant\u2019s parents and older sister later joined him and his brothers in the \nUnited States. (Tr. 48-49, 88, 99-; GE 1) Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \nJune 1996, and was issued his most recent U.S. passport in July 2007. (GE 1; AE M, \nAE N) \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s father was an Iranian Army colonel during the Shah of Iran\u2019s \ngovernment, and was \u201cin charge of passports in Iran.\u201d When his father retired from the \nIranian Army, he joined the family business of \u201cmulti-generational real estate people\u201d \ndoing \u201cland transactions.\u201d His father\u2019s post-military real estate career was going well \nuntil the Shah was overthrown in February 1999. Hearing reports that several of his \nfriends were executed shortly after the Shah was overthrown, Applicant\u2019s father left Iran \nfor the United States. His father remained in the United States until he passed away in \n2008. (Tr. 102-105)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s elderly mother is a naturalized U.S. citizen and lives in Iran part time. \nAt the time of Applicant\u2019s hearing, she was in Iran and unable to return to the United \nStates because of poor health. Applicant tries to communicate with his mother \u201conce a \nweek\u201d on the telephone. His mother was a school teacher before becoming a \nhomemaker. (Tr. 49-54, 82-85, 90-91, 97, 99) Applicant has two older brothers and an \nolder sister, who live in the United States. His oldest brother and sister are successful \nphysicians and his other brother is a real estate agent and software programmer. \nApplicant communicates with his siblings on a regular basis as time allows, given \neveryone\u2019s respective schedules with their careers and families. (Tr. 55-57) \n \n \nApplicant has extended family members on his mother\u2019s side living in Iran, \nincluding an aunt, three (\u201cmaybe four\u201d) uncles, and several cousins who are resident \ncitizens of Iran. His aunt and uncles are retired, elderly, and not affiliated with the \nIranian government. Since Applicant came to the United States, he talked to his \nrelatives in Iran infrequently -- a handful of times by telephone. He met one of his \ncousins, a dentist, who visited the United States about seven years ago. All of his \nuncles on his father\u2019s side have passed away. Applicant does not have a close \nrelationship with any of his relatives in Iran, except his mother. (Tr. 57-63) \n \n \nApplicant has ownership or co-ownership interest in approximately 12 properties \nin Iran, including a family home, two apartments, a house, and eight parcels of land, \nwith an estimated value of at least $1 million U.S. dollars. These properties are \nmanaged by his mother. All of these properties were acquired by his late father before \nthe Iranian revolution. Applicant has not visited these properties since he arrived in the \nUnited States nor does he provide any financial support to maintain them. These \nproperties are also co-owned by his siblings and his mother. Applicant did not have a \nfull appreciation of his Iranian properties until he completed the paperwork for his \n\n \n4 \n \nbackground investigation. It was only after some extensive conversations with his \nbrothers that he realized the extent of his real estate holdings in Iran. Once he became \naware of these assets, he fully disclosed that information during his background \ninvestigation. (Tr. 63-68, 85-87, 89, 95) \n \n \nUnbeknownst to Applicant, he also had an ownership or co-ownership interest in \nan Iranian bank account used to maintain family properties in Iran. This bank account \nhas an undetermined value, and is managed and controlled by his mother. Applicant \nhas no idea when this bank account was established, has never seen a bank statement, \nand requested that his name be removed from the account. Applicant surmised this \naccount was established when he was a child by his parents. He only found out about \nthe bank account when he began making inquiries of his family members in response to \nquestions that arose during his background investigation. Applicant had his name \nremoved from the account, which is documented by the sworn affidavit of his brother. \n(Tr. 71-72, 88-89, 108-109; AE W)  \n \n \nApplicant has a number of properties in the United States that far exceed the \nvalue of the Iranian properties in which he may have an interest. Because of the current \nembargo between the United States and Iran, Applicant is unable to derive any \nproceeds from the family Iranian properties. Furthermore, he has no control over his \nIranian property interests, nor does he want any involvement with these properties. In \nessence, Applicant\u2019s Iranian properties are of no value to him. (Tr. 68-70, 95-96; GE 4; \nAE E) To that end, he set up a blind trust in December 2018, which is irrevocable for the \nduration of his employment as a defense contractor that transferred any and all of his \nIranian property rights to his older brother. Applicant has chosen not to be involved in \nany way with any property in Iran, real or personal, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t care what happens \nto it.\u201d The terms of this blind trust are documented by the sworn affidavit of his brother. \n(Tr. 70-71, 89-90, 106-107; AE H, AE V, AE W)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s real property holdings in the United States consist of four homes and \nseveral land parcels. He estimates his net worth to be in the range of $5 to $6 million \ndollars. He has approximately $100,000 in retirement accounts. (Tr. 72-74, 107; AE T) \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary as a contract physician is $450,000. He also has a part-time \njob as a physician consultant with a search engine company, with an annual salary of \n$200,000. His combined annual salary is $650,000. (Tr. 107-108; AE K) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant is alleged to have falsified his September 2016 e-QIP by failing to list \ntwo of his siblings, three uncles, an aunt, his Iranian real estate holdings, and the \nIranian bank account, discussed above. Before submitting his e-QIP on line, Applicant \ncompleted a draft hard copy of his e-QIP. When completing his e-QIP on line, he \nencountered some \u201ccomputer glitches.\u201d He thought he had provided the requested \ninformation when he hit the \u201csubmit\u201d button, but apparently the information did not go \nthrough. He stated when he hit the \u201csubmit\u201d button, the program \u201cwould just freeze.\u201d He \ninformed the security office about the problems he encountered when completing his e-\nQIP and provided documentation of same. (Tr. 75-78, 90-94; AE U, AE V)  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant provided the draft hard copy of his e-QIP that he used when completing \nhis e-QIP on line. The draft hard copy listed the missing relatives. He also disclosed \nthese relatives during his April 2018 Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject \nInterview (OPM PSI), and in his March 2018 Response to Interrogatories. (Tr. 75-78, \n94; GE 2, GE 3; AE D, AE F)  \n \n \nApplicant is also alleged to have falsified his September 2016 e-QIP by failing to \nlist his real property interests in Iran. As discussed above, Applicant was unaware of \nthese properties until he underwent his background investigation. As with the missing \nrelatives issue, Applicant disclosed the Iranian bank account during his OPM PSI as \nwell as in his Response to Interrogatories. Applicant credibly testified regarding these e-\nQIP omissions and did not attempt to withhold or conceal information on his e-QIP to \ngain a position of trust. (Tr. 78-82) \n  \n \nApplicant professed his loyalty for the United States. He appreciates the \nfreedoms and opportunities available to him and his family here. Applicant believes he \nhas served the United States well as a productive citizen. He is grateful that he can \nprovide care for this country\u2019s servicemen and women and their dependents, and give \nback in some small measure to the United States what this country has given to him. \n(AE A)  \n  \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant called an active duty senior hospital corpsman (HM) as a character \nwitness. HM is the clinical supervisor and senior technician at the hospital where \nApplicant is employed. HM has held a secret security clearance for 19 years and is \nfamiliar with the clearance process. HM supervises 34 active duty military personnel \nand 16 civilian employees. (Tr. 17-20) HM has known Applicant since he reported to the \nhospital in January 2017 and interacts with him on a daily basis, 12 hours a day, 5 days \na week. (Tr. 20-21) HM described the clinic workload as \u201cvery heavy,\u201d with their \nradiologists responsible for treating \u201cthousands of patients.\u201d He stated Applicant is \nalways willing to assist in whatever task is needed and always puts the patient first. \nApplicant is considered to be a very honest, straightforward, caring, dependable, and \ntrustworthy physician. (Tr. 21-26) \n \n \nApplicant has earned a reputation for being one of the most highly respected \nradiologists on staff. HM has no reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States. \nHe is familiar with the security concerns Applicant is facing and stated that that he has \nno concerns with Applicant\u2019s ties to Iran. HM recommended Applicant for a position of \ntrust. Applicant regularly demonstrates his trustworthiness in a key position that is \ncrucial to this hospital\u2019s ability to provide timely and comprehensive services to their \npatient population. (Tr. 26-28) \n \n \nApplicant submitted numerous reference letters from fellow physicians and \ncolleagues. The collective sense of these letters reflects that Applicant is loyal to the \nUnited States, and is a tremendous asset at the hospital and to the patient population \nhe serves. (AE B, AE P) Applicant has authored or co-authored 22 articles published in \n\n \n6 \n \nvarious medical journals or medical media, participated in 31 oral presentations, and \nparticipated in two funded research projects. (AE L) His work performance evaluations \nand awards document rock-solid performance. (AE O, AE Q) On the home front, \nApplicant and his family are firmly established in their community. (AE A, AE I, AE J) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n\n \n7 \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a part-time resident of Iran, and his aunt, at least three \nuncles, and several cousins are resident citizens of Iran, a country that is clearly hostile \nto the United States. See ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007). Iran is \na leading state sponsor of terrorism; it conducts cyber espionage and attacks, and more \ntraditional espionage against U.S. interests and allies; and the government of Iran has \ncommitted numerous, serious human rights abuses against its people and foreign \nvisitors. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. Applicant\u2019s real property and financial assets raise additional concerns under \nthis Guideline. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f) have been raised by the evidence. Further \nreview is necessary. \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \n\n \n8 \n \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 1978. His wife is a native-born U.S. \ncitizen. His three children were born in the United States. His mother, in poor health and \nunable to travel, is a U.S. citizen but currently living in Iran. His two older brothers and \nolder sister are well-established professionals and productive members of society living \nin the United States. He credibly professed his allegiance to the United States. I find \nthat it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of the United States and the interests of the Iranian government, any terrorist \norganization, or his Iranian family members. I further find there is no potential for conflict \nof interest, because Applicant has such deep and long-standing relationships and \nloyalties in America that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant has temporarily divested himself of any Iranian financial interests, \nwhich under the current political situation are worthless to him in any event. The \nevidence further established that, before Applicant temporarily divested himself of these \nassets, his knowledge of and involvement with these Iranian assets was negligible or \nnon-existent. Even if Applicant\u2019s Iranian assets proved to be of value at some later time, \nthey are unlikely to result in a conflict that could effectively influence, manipulate, or \npressure him given his significant U.S. assets. AG \u00b6 8(f) is applicable. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant credibly stated that, when he completed his e-QIP, he believed that he \nhad reported all the requested family background information regarding his Iranian \nrelatives. Sensing that the information might not be accurately recorded, he promptly \nalerted his security office of the problems he encountered with the computer program \nand provided documentation of same. He also provided the draft hard copy of his e-QIP \nthat listed the missing relatives. Furthermore, he reported his Iranian relatives during his \nOPM PSI and in his Response to Interrogatories. \n \n \nApplicant credibly stated that he was unaware of his interests in his family\u2019s \nIranian properties and bank account when he completed his e-QIP. His background \ninvestigation prompted him to investigate these holdings further. It was only after \n\n \n9 \n \nextensive conversations with family members that he came to realize the extent of these \nproperties and the existence of the bank account in Iran. As with his Iranian relatives, he \nreported these properties and the bank account during his OPM PSI and in his \nResponse to Interrogatories. As noted, he has since divested himself of those interests \nin Iranian assets. Based on the available information, it appears Applicant did not \nexercise the attention to detail he could have when completing his e-QIP, but  that lack \nof attention to detail was not a willful and deliberate attempt to undermine the \ninvestigative process. Although the information he provided regarding his Iranian \nrelatives and Iranian assets later proved to be incomplete or inaccurate, I attribute these \nlapses to carelessness and am satisfied that he did not deliberately and intentionally fail \nto disclose his relatives or Iranian assets with the intent to deceive.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing \nalone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind \nwhen the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to \nconclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under \nGuideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to \npresent evidence to explain the omission. \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). Applicant has refuted the allegation that he intentionally \nfalsified his security clearance application, and his e-QIP answers do not raise \ntrustworthiness concerns. \n \nAnalysis \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n10 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines B and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly \nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members and financial interests in a hostile country. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s foreign interests make him or her \nvulnerable to exploitation. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly \ngreater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is \nassociated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct \nintelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. Iran is a leading state sponsor of terrorism, conducts espionage \nagainst the United States, and has a dismal human rights record.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members have no direct connection to the Iranian government \nand are not likely to raise Applicant\u2019s profile with the Iranian government. Applicant was \nsincere, open, and candid at the hearing. In the unlikely event that his family members \nwere subjected to coercion or duress from the Iranian government or terrorist groups, I \nam confident that his deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates, including his uncompromising commitment to this country and his wife and \nchildren, would cause Applicant to resolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress in favor of the United States.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s national security eligibility. I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign \ninfluence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a public trust position. National security eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR financial allegations. He is a 48-year-old cyber security specialist employed by a U.S. defense contractor since 2016. He has been self- employed in similar positions since October 2010. His clearance status is unclear. Since 2010, Applicant has started a series of businesses, sometimes with partners, sometimes solo. The tax structures of the various companies complicated his personal taxes, which he found overwhelming. Consequently, he failed to timely file his income tax returns as required. He considered obtaining professional help, and dabbled some with an individual who was prepared to handle matters going forward, but who was not prepared to handle his back taxes. He recently hired an administrator, attorney, and bookkeeper for his company, and his delinquent personal income tax returns were filed in April 2019. He did not consider timely filing of his tax returns to be an urgent matter, as he understood there was no penalty for filing late if a refund was due (Tr. 25- 26). He also changed his withholding so that he would almost always overpay, and be entitled to a refund. The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2010-2017 (2010-2013 for SOR 1.a; 2014-2017 for SOR 1.b), and that the 2014-2017 tax returns remained unfiled at the time of the SOR.

DOHA assigned the case to me 26 \nFebruary 2019, and I convened a hearing 8 April 2019. DOHA received the transcript 30 \nApril 2019, and the record closed. \n1Consisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-2, hearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant exhibits \n(AE) A-F. AE E-H were timely received post hearing. AE E-G comprise Applicant\u2019s 2014 Federal income tax \nreturn. \n2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on 8 June \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations. He is a 48-year-old cyber \nsecurity specialist employed by a U.S. defense contractor since 2016. He has been self-\nemployed in similar positions since October 2010. His clearance status is unclear. \nSince 2010, Applicant has started a series of businesses, sometimes with \npartners, sometimes solo. The tax structures of the various companies complicated his \npersonal taxes, which he found overwhelming. Consequently, he failed to timely file his \nincome tax returns as required. He considered obtaining professional help, and dabbled \nsome with an individual who was prepared to handle matters going forward, but who \nwas not prepared to handle his back taxes. He recently hired an administrator, attorney, \nand bookkeeper for his company, and his delinquent personal income tax returns were \nfiled in April 2019. He did not consider timely filing of his tax returns to be an urgent \nmatter, as he understood there was no penalty for filing late if a refund was due (Tr. 25-\n26). He also changed his withholding so that he would almost always overpay, and be \nentitled to a refund. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2010-2017 (2010-2013 for SOR 1.a; 2014-2017 for SOR 1.b), and that the \n2014-2017 tax returns remained unfiled at the time of the SOR. Applicant\u2019s November \n2018 Answer included Applicant\u2019s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax transcripts for tax \nyears 2008-2017. Tax years 2008-2009 are not at issue. Applicant\u2019s 2010-2013 tax \ntranscripts show that he timely filed for an extension of time to file for tax years 2010, \n2011, and 2013, and that he timely filed his 2010 and 2013 income tax returns. \nAlthough he timely filed for an extension for 2011, he did not file his tax return until nine \nmonths after the extended due date. While he did not file for an extension for tax year \n2012, he filed the return within three months of the due date. He received substantial \ntax refunds for each of the years, although he owes about $800 on tax year 2013 for \notherwise unexplained late payment penalties and interest (AE H). Applicant did not file \nfor extensions of time to file for tax years 2014-2017, and they remained unfiled at the \ntime of the SOR. AE A-G show that Applicant filed his 2014-2018 Federal income tax \nreturns in April 2019. He apparently has refunds totaling about $32,463 for state and \nFederal taxes for 2014-2017, but owes about $19,345 for 2018. \nApplicant provided no work or character evidence, or evidence of community \ninvolvement. He has not received credit or financial counseling. He provided no budget. \nSpecifically, while he submitted evidence that his delinquent taxes had now been filed, \nhe provided no evidence of contacts with the IRS to show his proposed arrangements \nfor reconciling the results of the four tax returns. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability \nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, \nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his \n4 \nFederal income tax returns for 2011, and 2014-2017, as required. Applicant knew he\nwas required to file his income tax returns, and he knew that his stated reason for failing \nto file did not excuse his conduct. \nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access \nto classified information. Indeed, the Board has previously \nnoted that a person who has a history of not fulfilling their \nlegal obligation to file income tax returns may be said not to \n3 See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n4\u00b619(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of \nthe same; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave demonstrated the high degree of judgment and \nreliability required for access to classified information.\u201d5 \nThis is true whether the failure to file is willful6 or attributed to the press of family \ncircumstances. 7 As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of \nclearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal \nor state income tax returns for 10 years. \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal \nobligation. Applicant\u2019s . . . failure to have done so for many \nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling \nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that \ngovern the handling of classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A \nperson who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 \n(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the \nJudge noted, Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 19(g) explicitly \nprovides that failure to file tax returns is a circumstance that \ncan raise a security concern. Moreover, the Directive \npresumes a nexus between admitted or proven conduct \nunder any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nclearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04648 at 3 (App. \nBd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 9, 2015)8 \nSecurity concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an \nApplicant is financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. Indeed, the \nAppeal Board has recently ruled that \u201cfailure to file tax returns by itself can be a reason \nto deny a clearance\u201d.9 \n5ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), reversing Administrative Judge\u2019s favorable decision. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd.

Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file). \n8The cases cited by Applicant\u2019s post-hearing brief all involve cases where the failures to timely file occurred \nover three-four years, and none of them has been identified as an Appeal Board case. \n9 See, ISCR Case No. 16-03208 (App. Bd.

Nor does the \nfact that the IRS has not undertaken any enforcement action against. \nNone of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations apply. His failures to \ntimely file his Federal taxes are both recent and multiple, and may not be demonstrated \nto be unlikely to recur.10 He has cited no circumstances that would demonstrate that his \nfailures to file were due to circumstances beyond his control. Certainly, he chose to start \nseveral new businesses. Moreover, Applicant was not responsible in addressing his \ntaxes. Applicant is an intelligent, well-educated man, with both the skill and experience \nto know when he should engage professional help. Yet, he did not do so for many \nyears, and apparently only when his clearance was at risk.11 \nThe circumstances of this case do not suggest that Applicant would benefit from \ncredit or financial counseling, but his taxes have been partially resolved to date.12 \nApplicant has documented what his tax accountant thinks his tax situation is, but there \nis no evidence of the IRS\u2019s view of his taxes.13 Applicant\u2019s tardy contacts with the IRS \ncannot be considered a good-faith effort to address his taxes, 14 to the extent that this \nmitigating condition could be considered applicable. Moreover, Applicant had mostly \ndisregarded these tax obligations since at least October 2015, when he missed his first \nextended filing deadline, and again since May 2017, when he discussed his delinquent \ntaxes with a Government investigator. His documented inaction for almost another two \nyears\u2014until April 2019, when he filed the four remaining delinquent returns\u2014raises \nsignificant security concerns that Applicant has not addressed by the flurry of activity \ntriggered by his receipt of the SOR. And that flurry of activity fails to mitigate Applicant\u2019s \noverall course of conduct, as it cannot overcome my conclusion that Applicant\u2019s track \nrecord of at least four years procrastination makes it too soon to conclude that his \nsecurity-significant conduct is behind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. \n10\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n11\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n12\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that \nthe problem is being resolved or is under control; \n13The fact that the IRS may not yet have taken action on Applicant\u2019s lately-filed taxes can only be attributed \nto Applicant\u2019s ongoing delays in filing his taxes. \n14\u00b620(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                              \n                                             \n Formal Findings \nParagraph 1.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 29, 2017. On June \n26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines J \nand F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 15, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on August 30, 2018. On August 31, 2018, a complete copy of the file of relevant \n02/21/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on September 7, 2018, and did not respond. The case was assigned \nto me on January 17, 2019.  \n \nThe FORM included Items 5 and 6, summaries of personal subject interviews (PSI) \nconducted on October 6, 2014 and December 27, 2017. The PSI summaries were not \nauthenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant \nthat he was entitled to comment on the accuracy of the PSI summaries; make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions or updates; or object to consideration of the PSI \nsummaries on the ground that they were not authenticated. I conclude that he waived any \nobjections to the PSI summaries by failing to respond to the FORM. Although pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2018) (holding \nthat it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any objection had \nbeen waived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the right to object). \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old custodian employed by a community rehabilitation \nfoundation. He has worked on a military installation since August 2016. He did not \ncomplete high school. He had kidney failure in June 2000, was hospitalized, underwent \na kidney transplant and dialysis, and was supported by Social Security disability \npayments. He was incarcerated from November 2010 to July 2012 and unemployed after \nhis release from prison until December 2012. He worked as a cook for a private-sector \nemployer from December 2012 to February 2013. He worked as a custodian for his \ncurrent employer from February 2013 to November 2014. He applied for a security \nclearance in December 2014, but it was denied. (Form Item 6 at 7.) He worked as a \ncustodian in the private sector from November 2014 until he began his current \nemployment.  \n \nApplicant married in August 2009 and separated in November 2010. He has no \ncontact with his wife and does not know where she lives. He is still married because he \ncannot afford a divorce. (FORM Item 6 at 2.) He has four adult children from other \nprevious relationships and a nine-year-old grandchild who lives with him. (FORM Item 4 \nat 24-26; FORM Item 6 at 2.) \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (FORM Item 4) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nBetween 1992 and 1995, Applicant was arrested for numerous traffic offenses, \nincluding driving without a license, driving while under the influence, and leaving the \nscene of an accident. (FORM Item 7 at 1-2.) These offenses were not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in April 2003 for three counts of negotiating worthless \nchecks. He had an acquaintance who printed fake checks, using the names of businesses \nlisted in the phone book. Applicant cashed the checks and gave his acquaintance a \npercentage of the proceeds. He was arrested after his third transaction with a fake check. \nHe was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 20 days and a fine. He was placed \non probation for two years and ordered to pay restitution. (FORM Item 8 at 4.) This offense \nis alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in September 2006 for felony possession of a forged check \nfor $418. In the October 2014 PSI, he told an investigator that he received the check from \na cousin and thought it was valid. (Form Item 5 at 4.) He was still on probation, which was \nrevoked. He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for five years,2 fined, and \nrequired to pay restitution. (FORM Item 8 at 4-5.) He was on probation from July 2007 to \nNovember 2010. (FORM Item 3 at 32.) This offense is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \nApplicant was charged with felony possession of a forged instrument in January \n2010. He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for five years, fined, and required \nto pay restitution. He was incarcerated from November 2010 to July 2012. (FORM Item 3 \nat 31; FORM Item 7 at 4.) This offense is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n \n \nDuring the October 2014 PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he committed the \nbad-check crimes because he was unemployed and needed money. He also told the \ninvestigator that being incarcerated gave him time to reflect on his life and led him to \nmake better life choices. (FORM Item 6 at 4.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record involving financial crimes is alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c \nunder Guideline J and cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a under Guideline F. In addition, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.b-2.e allege four delinquent debts reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit report from April 2018 \n(FORM Item 11.). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: child-support arrearage of $155,800. Applicant owes child support \nfor three children. His credit reports reflect that in March 2015, his arrearage was $14,065. \n(FORM Item 9 at 1.) In April 2017, it was $150,597. (FORM Item 10 at 3.) In April 2018, \nit was $155,800. (FORM Item 11 at 1.) Court records reflect as of June 25, 2018, he owed \n$91,672 for Child #1; $52,663 for Child #2; and $12,813 for Child #3. (Attachments to \nAnswer, pages 1-5.) During the December 2017 PSI, he told the investigator that he fell \nbehind on child-support payments while he was hospitalized and unable to work. He told \nthe investigator that he is paying a total of $150 per month, which is automatically \ndeducted from his pay. He is making no progress, because his credit reports reflect that \n                                                          \n2 The SOR alleges that he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years, suspended, and probation for \nthree years. \n\n \n4 \n \nthe amount of arrearage is increasing. He told an investigator that he expects to be paying \nthe arrearage for the rest of his life. (FORM Item 6 at 7.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: telecommunications bill placed for collection of $431. During the \nDecember 2017 PSI, Applicant told an investigator that this debt was for unreturned \nequipment and that he had forgotten about it. In his answer to the SOR, he provided \nevidence of a payment agreement providing for monthly $72 payments and evidence of \npayments for July through December 2018. (Answer to SOR at 6-7.) This debt is being \nresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d: credit-card account past due for $75, with a total balance of $409. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was making payments on this debt \nunder a verbal agreement to pay $50 per month. He submitted no documentation of an \nagreement or any payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e: credit-union charged off for $250. During the December 2017 PSI, \nApplicant told the investigator that this debt was a \u201ccrunch loan\u201d that he had forgotten \nabout. (FORM Item 6 at 8.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he was making \nweekly payments of $25. He submitted a receipt for one $25 payment in July 2018, but \nno evidence of any further payments. (Answer to SOR at 8)  \n \n \nIn the October 2014 PSI, Applicant told a security investigator that his financial \nsituation was \u201cnot very good,\u201d and he was barely able to pay his bills on time. (FORM \nItem 5 at 6.) In the December 2017 PSI, he told a security investigator that his overall \nfinancial situation is \u201cgood,\u201d but he provided no specific information about his income and \nexpenses. (FORM Item 6 at 9.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s criminal record establishes the following disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline:  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant; \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are established. Applicant\u2019s last criminal conduct was more \nthan nine years ago. He has completed his prison sentences, has not engaged in any \nfurther criminal conduct, and has been employed continuously since he was released \nfrom prison in July 2012. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(d): deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are established for the child-support arrearage alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.b and the telecommunications bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d. His child-support \narrearage was caused in part by his unemployment due to a serious illness and a \nsubstantial recovery period. His unemployment during his incarceration was due to his \ncriminal conduct and was not a condition largely beyond his control. He has acted \n\n \n8 \n \nresponsibly toward his child-support arrearage by making regular payments by automatic \ndeduction. He is making regular payments on the telecommunications bill.  \n \n \nThese two mitigating conditions are not established for the credit-card account \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d and the \u201ccrunch loan\u201d alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e. He submitted no \nevidence of payments or a payment agreement for the credit-card account and no \nevidence of continuing payments on the debt to the credit union. However, the small \namounts of these debts have minimal security significance.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not disputed any of the debts alleged \nin the SOR. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).3  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant is a convicted two-time felon, but a security \nclearance adjudication is not a punishment tool for criminal conduct. He apparently \nlearned his lesson in prison and has been a law-abiding citizen for nine years. His decision \nto voluntarily take custody of his nine-year-old grandson reflects his current sense of \nresponsibility. His child-support arrearage is overwhelming, but he has been making \nregular payments while working at minimum-wage jobs.  \n \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure, nor is it intended to \npunish previous criminal behavior. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) \nApplicant has demonstrated that he has become a responsible, reliable, and trustworthy \ncitizen. \n \n                                                          \n3 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J and \nF, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his history of criminal conduct and his \ndelinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Glassman, Esquire \n06/11/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n    Statement of the Case \nOn September 19, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. On \nOctober 11, 2018, Applicant timely submitted a response in which both allegations \nunder Guideline G were admitted, the sole allegation raised under Guideline J was \ndenied, and a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) was requested.  \nOn January 16, 2019, I was assigned the case. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 12, 2019, setting the \nhearing for March 28, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \nThe Government offered four documents, accepted without objection as exhibits \n(Exs.) 1-4, as well as two hearing exhibits, noted as Exs I-II. Applicant offered testimony \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nand four documents, accepted without objection as Exs. A-D. On April 3, 2019, one \nadditional document was submitted by Applicant. It was accepted into the record without \nobjection as Ex. E The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 11, 2019, and the record \nwas closed. Based on the exhibits, testimony, and record as a whole, I find Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns raised.   \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old video-conference technician who has been in that \nposition working for the same employer for over five years. He is a high school graduate \nwho was enrolled in community college from 2004 to 2006, until his education was \ninterrupted by a debilitating accident. Applicant has, however, pursued and received \nmultiple post-secondary certifications. He is single and has no children. He applied for a \nsecurity clearance in 2016. The results of the subsequent investigation led to the SOR. \n \n \nIn late June 2013, Applicant attended a pool party, arriving around 3:00 p.m. The \nparty was \u201cbyob\u201d - bring your own bottle or booze \u2013 so liquor was available. Although \nthe party began to unwind around dusk, Applicant decided to stay behind because he \nhad been drinking vodka mixed with juice. (Tr. 17-19) Around 10:00 p.m., he decided to \nleave the party with a friend. He planned to run an errand, then drop the friend off on his \nway home. Applicant was pulled over for speeding around 1:00 a.m. During the stop, he \nregistered a .11 blood alcohol content (BAC) on a breathalyzer and failed a field \nsobriety test. (Tr. 22) In late September 2013, Applicant entered into a plea agreement \nwith the prosecutor under advice of counsel. (Tr. 24) Pleading guilty, Applicant was \nfound guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was sentenced to 60 \ndays confinement (suspended), agreed to two years of probation, had his driver\u2019s \nlicense suspended for 60 days, and paid a $500 fine plus court costs. He successfully \ncompleted his probation period in September 2015.  \n \n \nIn early November 2016, a couple of months after applying for a security \nclearance, Applicant left a dance bar after consuming two rum drinks. They were served \neither straight or with mixer, over the course of about two hours. (Tr. 29-31) He did not \nfeel so impaired he should not drive a vehicle. (Tr. 48-49) Heading home in his \nautomobile with his girlfriend, who was then visiting from out-of-town, he was stopped \nfor speeding at around 1:00 or 2:00 am. As the officer prepared to conduct sobriety and \nbreathalyzer testing, Applicant curtailed his participation in the examination. (Tr. 27-28, \n36) He does not recall if he understood that in declining to submit to a breathalyzer, his  \ndriver\u2019s license would be automatically suspended. (Tr. 28)  \n \nUltimately, in February 2017, Applicant appeared before a judge and pled guilty \nto driving while intoxicated (DWI). He was again sentenced to 60 days confinement, but \nthis time he served seven days in prison and paid both a $200 fine plus court costs. \nAlthough two years of supervised probation were ordered, he met the criteria for early \nabatement in April 2018 and was transferred to unsupervised probation through mid-\nFebruary 2019. (Ex. D) In the interim, he completed alcohol and drug testing and, from \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nFebruary to April 2017, he attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) about twice a week. \n(Tr. 41, 53, 56-57) \n \n \nSince the DUI, Applicant has had no additional brushes with the law. He \nrecognizes that his troubles were based on poor judgment that needed to be improved. \nDuring counseling, he totally refrained from alcohol, but he now limits his alcohol \nconsumption to two to three glasses of alcohol per month. (Tr. 42-46) Since April 2018, \nhe has considered himself a \u201csocial drinker.\u201d (Tr. 50-51) This is an overall reduction in \nhis alcohol consumption compared to his earlier patterns before the DWI. (Tr. 53)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s driving privilege has been restored. He no longer drives his own \nsporty vehicle, which is presently on blocks in his driveway. When he needs to drive, he \nuses his girlfriend\u2019s utilitarian automobile. (Tr. 57) Otherwise, having purposefully \nrelocated to a home near public transportation where he now cohabitates with his \ngirlfriend, he relies on that mode of transportation or hires either Uber or Lyft. (Tr. 57)  \n \nApplicant does not drive if he has been imbibing. (Tr. 63) He has also had to \nmonitor his alcohol consumption due to a form of eczema wherein alcohol \u201cwas ruining\u201d \nhis skin. (Tr. 68) His personal circle of friends has been reduced and he no longer \nsocializes as much with those with whom he used to once abuse alcohol, preferring to \nassociate with a more professional crowd. (Tr. 68) At present, he is excelling at work \nand looking to aspire to a more challenging and more lucrative position. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. The AG \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. In addition, an applicant is responsible for \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe Alcohol Consumption guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21:  \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related DUI in 2013 and DWI in 2016 demonstrate his \nexcessive use of alcohol and related poor judgment. They, therefore, establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline could potentially be mitigated \nby the following applicable factors:  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment \nprogram along with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations.  \n \nApplicant was twice cited for drinking and driving within a three year period, with \nhis second period of unsupervised probation only ending about three months ago. Both \nwere the result of attending activities where it could be presumed alcohol would be \nimbibed, and predicted that driving home would conclude the evening. Applicant \nacknowledges his poor judgment and takes responsibility for his actions. He has \ncompleted an alcohol and drug program and, for a few months, benefitted from AA \nattendance.   \n \nApplicant now drinks alcohol to a lesser degree and has foresworn drinking and \ndriving going forward. To that end, he has relocated to a home near public \ntransportation, has altered his circle of friends, and is more cognizant of the amount of \nalcohol he consumes. These efforts show promise. With his period of probation now \nover for only a short three months, however, insufficient time has passed to \ndemonstrate a clear and established pattern of modified alcohol consumption. At least a \nyear free of probation seems to be a reasonable period or benchmark upon which to \nbest assess that Applicant is fully in control of his use of alcohol and capable of superior \njudgment. At best, AG \u00b6(d) applies in part.  \n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s drinking and driving convictions in 2013 and 2016 establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin 6 combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the following \napplicable factor: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \n \nHere, Applicant is genuinely contrite over his past criminal offenses. He has \ncompleted appropriate alcohol and drug counseling, attended AA for a notable period, \nchanged his professional focus and personal circle of friends, relocated near public \ntransportation in order to obviate his reliance on driving, reduced his alcohol \nconsumption, matured, and foresworn driving after drinking. Besides these \nachievements, Applicant no longer drives his sporty car, relying instead on his \ngirlfriend\u2019s less seductive auto, Uber, or Lyft. He is genuinely contrite over his past \ncriminal offenses. He has settled down with his girlfriend. Applicant completed the \nperiods of probation sentenced after both his DUI and DWI convictions. He now aspires \nto a more challenging and lucrative employment position. Such accomplishments \ndemonstrate that he is now ready to go willingly go forward living his life in compliance \nwith laws and regulations.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under the two \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \napplicable guidelines in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s highly \ncredible testimony, background, age, behavioral changes, and subsequent maturation. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance vis-\u00e0-vis alcohol \nconsumption. The evidence persuades me that he has matured sufficiently to comport \nhis behavior with applicable laws and regulations in general. Since Applicant has \nchosen to continue to imbibe, however, more time than a couple of months since the \nend of his last alcohol-related probation is needed to demonstrate that he is fully \ncapable of independently monitoring his behavior with regard to his alcohol use and \ndriving, and to exhibit appropriate reliability and judgment. Consequently, I conclude \nalcohol consumption security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

(Item 1.) The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 2, 2018.  He requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 2.)  On \nSeptember 10, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, was \nmailed to Applicant on September 12, 2018, and received by him on September 20, \n2018. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of \nthe FORM. Applicant failed to respond to the FORM. Applicant did not object to Items 1 \n\n \n2 \n \nthrough 6, and they are admitted into evidence, hereinafter referenced as Government \nExhibits 1 thorough 6.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. He is unmarried with no children.  He has a Master\u2019s \ndegree.  He is employed with a defense contractor as an Electrical Design and Analysis \nEngineer.  He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.  Applicant began working for defense contractor A in 2011.      \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The SOR \nidentified five delinquent debts that have been charged off or placed for collection \ntotaling in excess of $34,000.  Applicant admits to each of the delinquent accounts listed \nin the SOR.  Credit Reports of Applicant dated June 3, 2016; and April 21, 2018; \nconfirm the indebtedness listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)      \n \nApplicant executed a security clearance application in April 2016 while working \nfor defense contractor A, where he has worked since September 2011.  At this time, \nhowever, he is being sponsored for a security clearance by defense contractor B.  To \nhelp resolve his delinquent debts, in August 2016, Applicant enrolled in a debt \nresolution program, and three of the five debts listed in the SOR are included in the \nprogram.  Another debt, listed in the SOR, he claims has been paid off.  Applicant \nprovided documentation of a debt resolution program, but there is no evidence of \npayments made after May 2017.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  Applicant completed a \nfinancial questionnaire in October 2017 that reflects a negative income.    \n \nThe following delinquent debts became owing:  \n \n1.a.  A delinquent debt owed to a credit union was charged off in the approximate \namount of $12,816.  Applicant stated that he has reached an agreement with the \ncreditor and has started making monthly payments of $150 on August 28, 2017.  \n(Government Exhibit 2, attachment 3.)  An email dated August 22, 2017, documents a \npayment agreement with the creditor, but there is no evidence that Applicant has made \nthese payments.  Applicant failed to submit anything in response to the FORM.  The \naccount remains outstanding.  (Answer to SOR.)    \n \n \n1.b.  A delinquent debt owed to a bank was charged off in the approximate \namount of $10,273. Applicant stated that he enrolled in a debt resolution program and \nthe account is one of many that will be settled through the program. (Applicant Exhibits \n1 and 2.)  Applicant failed to submit anything in response to the FORM, to show that \n\n \n3 \n \nongoing payments have been made.  The account remains outstanding.    (Government \nExhibit 2.) \n \n \n1.c.  A delinquent debt was charged off in the approximate amount of $5,168.  \nApplicant stated that he enrolled in a debt resolution program and the account is one of \nmany that will be settled through the program.  (Government Exhibit 2, attachments 1 \nand 2.)  Applicant failed to submit anything in response to the FORM, to show that \nongoing payments have been made.  The account remains outstanding.    (Answer to \nSOR.) \n \n \n1.d.  A delinquent debt was charged off in the approximate amount of $4,604.  \nApplicant stated that he enrolled in a debt resolution program and the account is one of \nmany that will be settled through the program.  Applicant Exhibits 1 and 2.  Applicant \nfailed to submit anything in response to the FORM, to show that ongoing payments \nhave been made.  The account remains owing.  (Government Exhibit 2 attachments 1 \nand 2.) \n \n \n1.e.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$1,330.  Applicant stated that the debt was settled and paid on August 2, 2018, through \nthe debt resolution program.  Applicant submitted an undated settlement agreement \nwith the creditor, but there is no evidence that payments were made.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit 2, attachment 5.)   \n \n \nApplicant has not stated how or why he fell behind on his financial obligations in \nthe first place, accumulating over $34,000 in debt in under two years.  There is no \ndocumentary evidence to show that he has continued to make the agreed payments \nbeyond the initial payment.  There is nothing in the record to indicate when his financial \nsituation will be resolved, and whether it is likely to recur.  There is insufficient \ndocumentation in the record to show that Applicant can control his finances and live \nwithin his means without difficulty.  He remains excessively indebted.       \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \n\n \n4 \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n\n \n5 \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant is excessively indebted to the creditors listed in the SOR.  Although he \nclaims that the debts are now being paid, he has failed to respond to the FORM, and did \nnot provide sufficient documentary evidence to show that they are still being paid. The \nrecord lacks appropriate documentation to substantiate the information he has provided.   \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has provided no explanation for the delinquent debts, specifically how \nor why he got into debt in the first place.  He also failed to provide evidence in mitigation \nto show that he is continuing to pay off his debt as agreed.  Under the particular \ncircumstances here, Applicant has failed to establish that he has acted reasonably or \nresponsibly with respect to his debts.  As it stands, Applicant started to address his debt \nand has demonstrated nothing more.  He has not demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely.  Most importantly, it has not been demonstrated that his current \nfinancial problems are under control.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  In the Government\u2019s FORM, Applicant was \ntold to provide documentary evidence in response to the FORM that supports the \napplicable mitigating conditions.   Applicant failed to respond.  There is insufficient \ndocumentation in the record to show that Applicant has resolved or continues to work \ntoward resolving his delinquent debt.  Accordingly, Applicant has not demonstrated that \nhe is financially responsible.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 15, 2017. \nOn June 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, \n2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 6, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The hearing was delayed because Applicant was at sea for much \nof 2018 to 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing \n\n \n2 \n \non August 19, 2019, for a scheduled hearing on September 10, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. \n \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into evidence. \nApplicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D into evidence. All exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s discovery letter and summary of \nexhibits were marked as hearing exhibits (HE) 1 and 2, and appended to the record. \nApplicant testified at the hearing. The record was held open for Applicant to submit any \ndocumentary evidence in mitigation. He submitted a statement, marked as AE E, which \nwas admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on \nSeptember 18, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old able seaman, most recently employed by a defense \ncontractor since October 2016. He was previously employed in the oil industry until he \nwas laid off in 2015, and worked as a truck driver trainee in 2016, making significantly \nless income than he does now. Applicant attended high school through the ninth grade, \nand did not earn a diploma. He married in 2010 and has three children (7, 11, and 14 \nyears old). He has never held a security clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has three delinquent debts totaling about $44,650. The \ndebts include a past-due mortgage account, a credit card account, and a collection \naccount from a truck driving school training program. Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations, with explanations.  \n \nApplicant was laid off from an oil industry job in 2015, and was unable to pay his \nmortgage. He explained his circumstances to the creditor, who agreed to stop foreclosure \nproceedings and work out a resolution, but the creditor reneged on the agreement \nbecause they thought there was a lien on the property. The creditor claimed Applicant\u2019s \nspouse had a lien against her, but it turned out to be a different person unrelated to her \nor the Applicant. Applicant retained an attorney in February 2017. Based on the advice of \nhis attorney, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in March 2017, to freeze the \nforeclosure process. Applicant terminated the bankruptcy in September 2017 after the \ncreditor agreed to renegotiate the mortgage. A new mortgage that charges a lower \ninterest rate was substituted, and Applicant has made regular payments under the new \nagreement since October 2018. The mortgage is current and the delinquency is resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n \nApplicant used a credit card to pay family expenses while he was laid off and \nunderemployed. The account became delinquent in November 2017, and was referred to \na collection agent. On the advice of his attorney, Applicant directed his attention and \nresources to solve his mortgage problem, before addressing the delinquent credit card. \nHe eventually contacted the collection agent in September 2019, and negotiated a \nsettlement to pay a reduced amount. He testified that he paid the full debt as agreed and \nthe account is closed. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant began training for an upgraded commercial driver\u2019s license with a \ntrucking company in 2016. He already held a class \u201cB\u201d license, and was hoping to upgrade \nit to a class \u201cA\u201d license. However, the trucking company charged Applicant full tuition for \nboth licenses, totaling $7,092, despite Applicant\u2019s possession of the class B license. \nApplicant disputed the charges, but the company was unwilling to reduce the debt. He \npaid $150 toward the debt, but refused to pay full tuition. Also, the salary he earned \nworking for the company was not sufficient to meet his household expenses. He left the \njob and began working for his current employer at a significantly greater salary. After the \nhearing, Applicant contacted the creditor to attempt to negotiate a payment plan, but they \ninsisted on full payment. Applicant does not have the money to pay the full amount, but \nhe intends to return to sea to earn enough voluntary overtime pay to satisfy the debt. \n \nApplicant had about $9,300 in savings and a 401(k) plan valued at about $7,000 \nat the time of the hearing. He now earns about $80,000 per year because of his increased \nvoluntary deployments. This income is sufficient to pay his household expenses and to \nsoon pay off his debt to the trucking company. Applicant participated in financial \ncounseling prior to filing bankruptcy. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony to be honest, sincere, \nand forthcoming. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19 (a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant incurred debts that were beyond his control due to a job loss and \nunderemployment. He has addressed his debts in a responsible manner. He resolved the \nmortgage and credit card debts, and despite disputing the truck driver training debt, he \nvowed to earn sufficient money to pay it. He sought and received advice from an attorney \nand participated in financial counseling. There are clear indications that his financial \nproblems are resolved or being resolved, and his financial status is under control. I find \nthat additional financial delinquencies are unlikely to recur and his financial status does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Mitigating \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through (e) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n\n \n6 \n \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I believe Applicant \nadequately explained his financial situation, and despite the debts incurred as a result of \njob loss and underemployment, his financial decision-making is sound and responsible. \nHe has not incurred additional debts since working as a seaman, and he is able to meet \nall financial needs of his family on his current salary.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

His spouse, parents, four siblings, and in-laws are all citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. He failed to show sufficient deep and longstanding ties to the United States \nto mitigate the security concerns raised by his relatives\u2019 presence in Afghanistan. National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 18, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), implemented June 8, 2017.  \n02/28/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on September 25, 2018, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted its file of relevant material (FORM) on October 23, 2018. Applicant received it \non November 27, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 10. \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant submitted no response to the FORM (Response) within the time period. Items \n1 through 9 are admitted into the record. The case was assigned to me on February 11, \n2019.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nIn the FORM, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Afghanistan. Department Counsel provided a six-page summary of the \nfacts, supported by seven Government documents pertaining to Afghanistan, marked as \nItem 10. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. \nThey are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They \nare set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, with clarifications. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a government contractor. He was born in \nAfghanistan. He and his immediate family fled to Pakistan from Afghanistan in August \n2001 to escape the presence of the Taliban. They returned to Afghanistan in September \n2003, after the U.S. presence in Afghanistan made it safe to return. He lived in \nAfghanistan through 2011. He graduated from high school in Afghanistan and attended \nsome college there. He married a U.S. citizen in 2010, and immigrated to the United \nStates on a spousal visa in July 2011. He has one minor child from that marriage. \nApplicant returned to Afghanistan as a translator for U.S. forces in late 2011 through May \n2013, when he returned to the United States. Applicant and his spouse divorced in \nOctober 2014. His former wife has custody of their child, and Applicant pays child support. \nHe married his second wife, a citizen and resident of Afghanistan, in April 2015. In 2017, \nhe returned to Afghanistan as a translator. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in June \n2017. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a full-time student and resides with her parents in Afghanistan. \nHis in-laws are citizens of Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is self-employed in a \nstationery supply company. His mother-in-law is a homemaker. Applicant has filed a \npetition to sponsor his wife to immigrate to the United States. They reside in a $4,000,000 \nhome owned by Applicant\u2019s father-in-law in Afghanistan. (Item 8.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, two brothers, and two sisters all are citizens and \nresidents of Afghanistan. He also has two sisters who are permanent residents of the \nUnited States. One of his U.S.-resident sisters works as a dental assistant and the other \nis a homemaker. His family in Afghanistan reside together in an apartment owned by his \nmother. The apartment is valued at approximately $150,000. Applicant\u2019s father is a real \nestate agent. His mother is a school teacher. His two of his sisters and two brothers in \nAfghanistan are students. Applicant sends approximately $2,500 to $3,000 monthly to his \nparent to assist with his siblings\u2019 education. He also provides money for his parents\u2019 food \nand living expenses. (Item 6; Item 7; Item 8.) \n \n \nApplicant \u201cdoes not feel he can live [in Afghanistan] because [he] grew up in an \neducated family, and [he] feels like [he] is not suited for the country (Afghanistan). [He] \ndoes not like the poverty in the country or the discrimination [he] received for growing up \nin a modern household.\u201d (Item 6 at 3.) \n \nAfghanistan \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has issued a travel warning with respect to \nAfghanistan, due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and armed conflict. It notes that travel \nto all areas of Afghanistan is unsafe due to the ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage taking, \nmilitary combat operations, suicide bombings, and insurgent attacks. Attacks may target \nofficial Afghan and U.S. governmental convoys and compounds. Extremists associated \nwith Taliban networks and the Islamic State are active throughout Afghanistan. \nWidespread human rights abuses are reported. (Item 10.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant has close connections to his wife, parents, siblings, and in-laws, who are \ncitizens and residents of Afghanistan. He provides support for his family there. Further, \nthere is an articulated heightened risk associated with having ties to family members in \nAfghanistan, due to the activities of terrorist organizations and insurgents operating within \nits borders. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nNone of the above conditions are mitigating in this instance. Applicant is in close \ncontact with his wife, parents, siblings, and in-laws in Afghanistan. He provides \nsubstantial financial support to his parents and siblings. Due to Applicant\u2019s close \nrelationship with his family and the terrorist threats and human rights abuses in \nAfghanistan, I cannot find it is unlikely he would be placed in a position of choosing \nbetween them and the interests of the United States. He failed to demonstrate deep and \nlongstanding loyalties to the United States. While he is credited for his years of service to \nthe United States as a linguist, the record contains little information on assets, or physical \nor emotional bonds to the United States, aside from the presence of his child and two \nsisters in the United States. Without more information, it cannot be determined that \nApplicant would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant \nserved honorably as a linguist. However, the record lacks information to support a finding \nthat he would resolve any conflicts of interest in favor of the United States. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. He failed to meet his burden to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for Foreign Influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel\n      For Applicant: Pro se      \n_____________\n Decision\n  ______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, I conclude that Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his financial considerations. Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of Case\nOn July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications\nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOD\nadjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a security\nclearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative\nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n02/27/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 25, 2018, and elected to have his case\ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on October 14, 2018, interposed no objections to the materials in the\nFORM, and did not supplement the FORM. The case was assigned to me on February 8,\n2019. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) had a tax lien entered against him in\nJanuary 2012 for $2,636; (b) is indebted to a lender on a home equity loan for $27,083;\n(c) is indebted on a mortgage account that went to foreclosure in 2013; and (d) is\nindebted on a mortgage account that went to foreclosure in 2016. Allegedly, the debts\nowing have not been resolved and remain outstanding. \n                \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with \nexplanations. He claimed the tax lien covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a is resolved. He claimed that\nthe home equity loan covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b is in the process of being resolved. He\nfurther claimed that the foreclosure covered by SOR \u00b6 1.c , for which he was a co-signor\non a loan made to his mother; he claimed the property was sold due to family\ncircumstances involving his mother and her husband. And he claimed that the foreclosure\ncovered by SOR \u00b6 1.d went to foreclosure  because of his loss of employment. Applicant\nattached a copy of the state tax lien released in July 2018, along with a copy of the\ncharged-off home equity account covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b.\nFinding   s   of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year-old mechanic for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nincorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant married his first wife in January 1998 and divorced her in February 1999.\n(Item 3) He has one child from this marriage. He remarried in February 2002 and has no\nchildren from this marriage. Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in August 1996 and\nreported no military service. (Item 3)\nSince August 2016, Applicant has worked for his current employer. (Item 3)\nBetween July 2002 and August 2016, he was employed by various employers in\nmechanic positions, interspersed with brief periods of unemployment. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nBetween 2012 and 2015, Applicant accumulated two delinquent debts totaling\napproximately $29,719. (Items 5-6)  One of the debts (SOR debt \u00b6 1.a) was a state tax\nlien that has since been resolved. (Items 2 and 4) Another listed debt (SOR debt \u00b6 1.b)\n2\n\nwas a delinquent home equity loan that was charged off In the approximate amount of\n$27,083. (Items 5-6) This loan has not been addressed to date and remains outstanding. \nBesides accruing the two referenced delinquent debts, Applicant incurred two\nforeclosures: one in 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and another in 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) The first of the\ntwo foreclosures involved a mortgage on which he co-signed a note for $206,450 in\nJanuary 2004 to finance a home for his mother. (Items 5-6) This mortgage was foreclosed\nin 2013 following family differences between Applicant\u2019s mother and her husband.\nApplicant could not reconcile with his mother, and she moved out of the house, leaving\nthe husband, who defaulted on the loan, still residing in the residence. (Items 2-6) The\nsecond foreclosure covered a rental property that Applicant financed in 2011 for $74,503\nthat he could no longer afford due to unemployment. (Items 2-6) Whether either of the\nforeclosures resulted in deficiency balances is unclear. \nTo date. Applicant has failed to document any progress in addressing his\ndelinquent SOR \u00b6 1.b debt. Absent proof of payment, or payment plan, of the home equity\nloan covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b, no favorable inferences can be drawn regarding Applicant\u2019s\naddressing of this debt. \nPolicies\n                \n       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into\naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,\nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and\nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to\nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG\n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\n3\n\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\n       The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can\nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of,\nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,\nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of\ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to\ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n4\n\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of two delinquent\ndebts (one a state tax lien for $2,636 and another a delinquent home equity loan)\ntotaling more than $29,000, and his incurring of two foreclosures on loans he assumed\nresponsibility for in 2004 and 2011, respectively. Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies and\ntwin foreclosures warrant the application of four of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of\nthe Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19 b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy\ndebts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local\nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as\nrequired.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts and foreclosures negate the need for any\nindependent proof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262\n(6th ed. 2006). Each of Applicant\u2019s admitted state tax lien, home equity loan deficiency,\nand two foreclosures are fully documented and create some judgment issues. See\nISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that\nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security\nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax filing lapses\nand debt delinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving federal and state tax\ndelinquencies and other debt delinquencies are critical to an assessment of an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following rules and\nguidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to holding a\nsensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR\nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited extenuating\ncircumstances (i.e., unemployment) provide some mitigation credit for his failure to\ntimely file address his state tax obligations and other debts when they came due. The\ncited circumstances he attributes to his debt delinquencies are enough to entitle him to\nsome extenuating benefits from MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\n5\n\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  But his failure to address his\nother debts after he returned to full time employment status precludes him from taking\nadvantage of the \u201cacted responsibly\u201d prong of MC \u00b6 20(b)\nSimilarly, satisfaction of Applicant\u2019s evidentiary burden of providing probative\nevidence of his addressing his home equity delinquency and two mortgage foreclosures\nrequires more documentation of his payment efforts and mortgage history than he has\nprovided in his submissions. While his tax lien satisfaction is encouraging, it is not\nenough by itself to mitigate his financial delinquencies without more evidence of a\nseasoned payment history.\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of\nfederal and state tax debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, his failures or inability to establish payment histories with three of\nhis covered creditors (excepting his resolution of the state tax lien covered by SOR \u00b6\n1.a) after the initiation of the security clearance process prelude favorable findings and\nconclusions with respect to raised security concerns over the state of his finances. \nWhole-Person Assessment\nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. He has shown insufficient \nprogress to date in addressing his home equity loan delinquency and the payment\nhistories behind his two listed foreclosures to merit enough positive overall credit to\nmitigate financial concerns.\nOverall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing his finances reflect too little\nevidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to overcome reasonable\ndoubts about his trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect classified information.\nSee AG \u00b6 18. Conclusions are warranted that his finances are not sufficiently stabilized\nat this time to meet minimum eligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. \nEligibility to hold a security clearance under the facts and circumstances of this case is\ninconsistent with the national interest.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   Subparagraph 1.a:\n     For Applicant\n   \n              Subparagraph 1.b-1.d:\n                          Against Applicant\n6\n\n \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to\nhold a security clearance.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel\n For Applicant: Pro se \n05/03/2019 \nRemand Decision\n  ______________ \nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge: \nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, I conclude that Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his financial considerations. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOD \nadjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a security \nclearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative \nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 25, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on October 14, 2018, interposed no objections to the materials in the \nFORM, and did not supplement the FORM. The case was assigned to me on February 8, \n2019. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) had a tax lien entered against him in \nJanuary 2012 for $2,636; (b) is indebted to a lender on a home equity loan for $27,083; \n(c) was indebted on a mortgage account that went to foreclosure in 2013; and (d) was \nindebted on a mortgage account that went to foreclosure in 2016. Allegedly, one of the \nunderlying debts owed has not been resolved and remains outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with \nexplanations. He claimed the tax lien covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a is resolved. He claimed that \nthe home equity loan covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b is in the process of being resolved. He \nfurther claimed that the foreclosure listed under SOR \u00b6 1.c, for which he was a co-signor \non a loan made to his mother, resulted in the sale of the underlying property. And he \nclaimed that the foreclosure covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d went to foreclosure because of his \nloss of employment. Applicant attached a copy of the state tax lien released in July 2018, \nalong with a copy of the charged-off home equity account covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nOn April 25, 2019, the Appeal Board remanded the decision for further processing. \nThe decision that follows on remand corrects the cited errors in the February 27, 2019, \nrestates the remaining findings, and confirms the conclusions reached in the February 27, \n2019 decision. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 44-year-old mechanic for a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are \nincorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married his first wife in January 1998 and divorced her in February 1999. \n(Item 3) He remarried in February 2002 and has one child from this marriage. Applicant \nearned an associate\u2019s degree in August 1996. \nApplicant enlisted in the Army in January 1998 and served four years of active \nduty. He received his honorable discharge in January 2002. (Item 3) \nSince August 2016, Applicant has worked for his current employer. (Item 3) \nBetween July 2002 and August 2016, he was employed by various employers in \nmechanic positions, interspersed with brief periods of unemployment.

(Items 5-6) One of the debts (SOR debt \u00b6 1.a) was a state tax \nlien that has since been resolved. (Items 2 and 4) Another listed debt (SOR debt \u00b6 1.b) \nwas a delinquent home equity loan that was charged off In December 2015 in the \napproximate amount of $27,083. (Items 5-6) This loan has not been addressed to date \nand remains outstanding. \nBesides accruing the two referenced delinquent debts, Applicant incurred two \nforeclosures: one in 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and another in 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The first of the \ntwo foreclosures involved a mortgage on which he co-signed a note for $86,317 in \nNovember 2002 to finance a home for his mother. (Items 5-6) This mortgage was \nforeclosed in 2014 following family differences between Applicant\u2019s mother and her \nhusband. Applicant could not reconcile with his mother, and she moved out of the house, \nleaving the husband, who defaulted on the loan, still residing in the residence. (Items 2-6) \nThe second foreclosure covered a rental property that Applicant financed by himself in \n2011 for $74,503 that he could no longer afford due to unemployment. (Items 2-6) \nWhether either of the foreclosures ever resulted in deficiency balances is unclear. \nApplicant\u2019s two credit reports (Items 6-7) report zero balances. And, Applicant believes \nthat any delinquent debts owed creditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d were credited in the sale. (Items 5-6) \nWhile neither of the reported zero balances are dispositive without more information in the \ncredit reports to establish payment histories and produced sales proceeds from the \nforeclosures, they are enough in Applicant\u2019s case to draw favorable inferences that the \nunderlying debts were resolved by foreclosure. \nTo date, Applicant has failed to document any progress in addressing his \ndelinquent SOR \u00b6 1.b debt. Absent proof of payment, or payment plan, of the home equity \nloan covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b, no favorable inferences can be drawn regarding Applicant\u2019s \naddressing of this debt. \nPolicies \nThe SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the \ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into \naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, \nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and \nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require \nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to \nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2\u00a9. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG \n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial \ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines \nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an \napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is \nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent in this case: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18. \nBurden of Proof \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence.

The required materiality showing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of two delinquent \ndebts (one a state tax lien for $2,636 and another a delinquent home equity loan) \ntotaling more than $29,000, and his incurring of two foreclosures on loans he assumed \nresponsibility for in 2004 and 2011, respectively. Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies and \ntwin foreclosures warrant the application of four of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of \nthe Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts and foreclosures negate the need for any \nindependent proof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 \n(6th ed. 2006). Each of Applicant\u2019s admitted state tax lien, home equity loan deficiency, \nand two foreclosures are fully documented and create some judgment issues. See \nISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security \nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax filing lapses \nand debt delinquencies.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving federal and state tax \ndelinquencies and other debt delinquencies are critical to an assessment of an \napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following rules and \nguidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to holding a \nsensitive position.

The cited circumstances he attributes to his debt delinquencies \nare enough to entitle him to some extenuating benefits from MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions \nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss \nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nHis failure to address his SOR \u00b6 1.b debt after he returned to full time employment \nstatus precludes him from taking advantage of the \u201cacted responsibly\u201d prong of MC \u00b6 \n20(b) \nSimilarly, satisfaction of Applicant\u2019s evidentiary burden of providing probative \nevidence of his addressing his home equity delinquency requires more documentation \nof his payment efforts on his SOR \u00b6 1.b home equity loan than he has provided in his \nsubmissions. While his tax lien satisfaction and pay offs of his two mortgages through \nforeclosure are credited to him, these debt resolutions are not enough to mitigate his \nfinancial delinquencies. More evidence of a seasoned payment history on his home \nequity loan is needed to make safe predictions that his finances are now stabilized and \nunder control. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of \nfederal and state tax debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, his failure or inability to establish a payment history in connection \nwith his equity loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) preludes favorable findings and conclusions with \nrespect to raised security concerns over the state of his finances. Financial concerns \nassociated with SOR \u00b6 1.b remain. \nWhole-Person Assessment \nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. He has shown insufficient \nprogress to date in addressing his home equity loan to merit enough positive overall \ncredit to mitigate financial concerns. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing his finances reflect too little \nevidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to overcome reasonable \ndoubts about his trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect classified information. \nSee AG \u00b6 18. Conclusions are warranted that his finances are not sufficiently stabilized \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n   \n          \n                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n                                        \nat this time to meet minimum eligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. \nEligibility to hold a security clearance under the facts and circumstances of this case is \ninconsistent with the national interest. \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the \ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I \nmake the following formal findings: \nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant\n    Subparagraph 1.b:\n Against Applicant \nConclusions \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \nhold a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nRoger C. Wesley \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n\n  \n8 \n\n  \n9 \n",
