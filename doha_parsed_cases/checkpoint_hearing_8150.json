He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 44 years old, married, and has three children. He works currently for a defense contractor in graphic design and computer support. He has worked for that employer for three years, since late 2005 or early 2006. He sought a job which had benefits and a regular income. Previously, he operated a wedding photography business out of his home. That business started to dwindle because of competition and digital photography. His income from that business at the end of it was about $30,000 annually. His bankruptcy filing shows his adjusted gross income in fiscal year 2006 was $91,655, and in fiscal year 2007 his adjusted gross income was $27,500.

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn July 13, 2007, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On May 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 19, 2008. He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 22, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. I received the case assignment on August 27, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on October 20, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November \n6, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted no exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe hearing (Tr.) on November 17, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated May 22, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, to 1.e, and 1.g of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i of the SOR. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, married, and has three children.  He works currently for \na defense contractor in graphic design and computer support.  He has worked for that \nemployer for three years, since late 2005 or early 2006.  He sought a job which had \nbenefits and a regular income. Previously, he operated a wedding photography \nbusiness out of his home. That business started to dwindle because of competition and \ndigital photography. His income from that business at the end of it was about $30,000 \nannually.  His bankruptcy filing shows his adjusted gross income in fiscal year 2006 was \n$91,655, and in fiscal year 2007 his adjusted gross income was $27,500.  He also \nworked a second job at a photo lab to support his family. He had the home-based \nphotography business from 1984 until 2006. He works a second job now as a \ncommercial photographer for a professional photography company.  For that company \nhe might work 18 weddings or similar functions this year, earning about $1,000 for each \nphoto shoot.  His income from the defense contractor is $42,000 annually.  Applicant \nhas not had a security clearance previously. (Tr. 17-27, 88-91, 98; Exhibits 1 and 3; \nAnswer) \n \n \nApplicant closed his photography business in 2006 because he was working at \nleast 80 hours per week, and his income was not growing.  In July 2006, his wife was \ndiagnosed with mucosal melanoma in her nose. It was removed, and then in September \n2007 she had a spot removed on her face.  Her condition seemed fine after both these \noccurrences.  In February 2008, his wife was diagnosed with cancer in her lung, spleen, \nliver, and sternum.  During part of this treatment period, he had to drive her 90 miles \none way to another city for the chemotherapy.  Later, his wife was able to have her \ntreatments in her home town.  She underwent chemotherapy until June 2008, when she \nwas hospitalized for three one-week long hospital admissions with different treatments.  \nShe also had been going to the emergency room frequently.  In August 2008, she was \nin an extreme condition.  Her chemotherapy regime was changed, and she has \nimproved dramatically.  At the time he closed his business, Applicant also realized he \nhad to undertake greater family responsibilities because of his wife\u2019s medical situation. \n(Tr. 23-25, 81-91, 98; Exhibits 1 and 3) \n \n \nApplicant has eight delinquent debts listed in the SOR totaling $247,151.  That \namount includes the mortgage balance on his foreclosed house which should have \nbeen paid through the foreclosure sale.  Of those eight debts, none have been proven \nto be paid except the last listed debt in Paragraph 1.h.  Applicant filed a Chapter 13 \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbankruptcy action on July 26, 2007, to resolve his financial delinquencies.  It was \ndismissed on October 4, 2007, because Applicant did not file an amended payment \nplan.  There was an error in a tax return filed as part of the bankruptcy, and while \nApplicant was getting it corrected, his father-in-law died.  Applicant\u2019s spouse is the \nexecutor of the estate.   His attorney advised him to let the bankruptcy petition be \ndismissed until the bequests from the estate were determined, and Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \ninheritance calculated.  She eventually received $13,000 from her father\u2019s estate.  \nApplicant and his wife spent $7,000 on a tax bill, utility bill payments, and several car \nrepairs, and retain $6,000 in an emergency fund.  She is also to get one-seventh of the \nvalue of her father\u2019s home when they are able to sell it.  He values it at about $95,000. \nApplicant was advised by two bankruptcy attorneys to hold off filing the Chapter 13 \npetition again until his creditors contact him again, especially with the medical \ndeductible payments being on-going with his wife\u2019s cancer condition.  Applicant would \nrather file bankruptcy soon and eliminate the financial uncertainly in his life, but feels he \nhas no choice because of his wife\u2019s cancer treatments and their costs.  He did \nparticipate in financial counseling when he filed the bankruptcy in 2007.   He also will \nprepare a budget for his home expenses. (Tr. 29-34, 53-55, 99-101; Exhibits 1, 3) \n \n \n Applicant owes $386 as the last payment on a leased vehicle he turned in at the \nend of the lease term in March 2007.  That time period was when Applicant had the \nmost financial constraints on him.  This debt has not been paid, though Applicant would \npay it if he had the money to do so.  This debt was included in his 2007 bankruptcy \nfiling. (Tr. 34, 35; Exhibits 1-6) \n \n \nApplicant owes $17,292 to a credit card company for debts incurred as part of \noperating his photography business.  He used the card to live on in 2006 as his \nbusiness declined.  This debt is included in his 2007 bankruptcy filing. It has not been \npaid.  The business was not a corporation, and the debt is a personal obligation of \nApplicant\u2019s. (Tr. 35, 36; Exhibits 1-6) \n \n \nApplicant owes four debts to a credit union with which he formerly did business. \nThe first debt is for $38,503 on an equity line of credit on his former home, $1,826 on an \nauto loan, and $212 on an overdraft protection account, and $4,756 for business \nequipment for his former photography business.  None of these debts have been paid.  \nAll were included in his bankruptcy petition filing.  The overdraft protection account \namount was listed in the SOR as $4,756, but the Government amended the amount to \nthe correct amount of $212, and Applicant had no objection to the amendment, so I \ngranted it.  (Tr. 36-42, 79; Exhibits 1-6) \n \n \nApplicant owes $179,850 on the mortgage due on his home which was \nforeclosed in 2007.  Applicant has not received any correspondence from the bank on \nthis debt.  To his knowledge, the bank bought the house for $191,000 at the auction.   \nThat sale price would be sufficient to satisfy his mortgage and part of the $38,503 line of \ncredit he had tied to the home value.   This debt was included in the 2007 bankruptcy \nfiling. (Tr. 42-44; Exhibits 1-6) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe last debt listed in the SOR was for $82 owed to a collector.  Applicant denied \nthat debt, and the credit report of October 27, 2008, shows the balance on this debt as \nzero.  It has been paid. (Tr. 44, 45; Exhibits 1-5) \n \n \nApplicant also owes debts not listed in the SOR.  He owes federal and state \nincome taxes for 2006.  He filed the tax returns, but did not have the money to pay the \ntaxes with the return after he changed his accounting system from accrual to cash \nbasis.  He has installment payment agreements with both tax collection agencies.  He \npays the federal tax at the rate of $150 monthly.  The original amount owed was about \n$9,500, and now is about $7,000.  He pays the state tax agency $75 monthly on a debt \nof $1,200. (Tr. 45-49, 64, 93) \n \n \nApplicant owes about $5,000 in medical debts.  He recently repaid $300 in co-\npayment bills.  He tries to pay the smaller bills.  The larger hospital bills of $1,500 to one \nhospital, for example, he cannot repay now. (Tr. 28, 29; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant owes $308 to a telephone company.  He has not paid that bill, and has \nnot had contact with the creditor for over a year. (Tr. 49; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s payments on his minivan are current.  He paid $162 to a children\u2019s \nhospital on a medical debt.  A medical debt to a cancer doctor for $1,108 was paid by \ninsurance.  Other medical bills listed in his bankruptcy petition were paid.  The $6,146 \nowed to a dentist from 2003 has not been paid because Applicant disputes that amount, \nand the quality of the work. (Tr. 49-53, 62; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant has not incurred any new long-term debt since February 2007.  He has \npaid debts which he could pay since then, and has managed to survive financially.  His \nfinancial statement provided as part of his interrogatory answers in March 2008, is \nsubstantially correct currently. (Tr. 54-64; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant has no credit cards presently.  He owns two cars, one he is purchasing \nand the other is a 1991 Ford Tempo he inherited from his wife\u2019s father.  His oldest child \nstarted college at a state university in September 2008.  The son is studying visual \ncommunications.  Applicant finances that education through loans, a scholarship, and a \ngrant.  Applicant paid $1,680 for the fall semester.  Applicant uses the money from his \nsecond job to pay that tuition. (Tr. 73-76) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n6 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay \nsome obligations for the last two years. He lived in his former home without paying the \nmortgage.  The foreclosure process started, and the debt continues to show on his \nlatest credit report.  He has not pursued the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and only paid an \n$82 debt listed in the SOR.  He did pay other small debts, but has not made any effort in \nthe past year to resolve the bulk of his delinquent debts.  He has delinquent taxes. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a \ncloser examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfinancial worries arose between about 2006. He accumulated delinquent debt due to his \nwife=s medical issues and his declining income from his business. The evidence does \nnot raise this potentially mitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of \nthe financial problems arose from his wife=s medical problems, including the medical \nbills not covered by insurance. His wife was first diagnosed with a form of cancer in July \n2006, after he was employed by the defense contractor.  He acted responsibly in \nclosing his business which consumed large amounts of his time, more than 80 per \nweek, and in finding a position with a regular income and benefits which were needed \nwhen his wife was diagnosed with cancer. Applicant also had to assume additional \nfamilial responsibilities when his wife\u2019s cancer spread in her body.  He also acted \nresponsibly when he explored Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and carefully prioritized his bills. \nHe allowed his residence to be foreclosed, reducing his housing costs.  But his business \nwas declining before his wife was diagnosed, so it was not a pre-existing condition \nunder his employer\u2019s medical insurance to prevent coverage.  I find this potentially \nmitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \n\n \n7 \n \n \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant received counseling as part of his 2007 bankruptcy \nfiling, and filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2007.  He dismissed it on advice of his \nattorneys when his wife was about to inherit money which might have allowed him to \nrepay his debts.  He has not refilled the bankruptcy petition, but would like to do so to rid \nhimself of the burden of these unresolved delinquent debts.  While he is not financially \nsound now because of his wife\u2019s cancer treatments, he does have a plan to resolve his \ndebts, and has paid some smaller debts while not incurring any other delinquent debt in \nalmost two years.  But he has not started a plan to repay his overdue creditors or \nresolve his delinquent debts without bankruptcy.  I conclude these two potentially \nmitigating conditions do not apply. \n \nThe connection between Applicant\u2019s inability to repay his delinquent debts, and \nhis wife\u2019s cancer treatments, is not shown persuasively by Applicant.  His financial \nsituation was declining before she was diagnosed in July 2006, and she was not shown \nto be in serious condition until February 2008, long after Applicant was employed with \nthe defense contractor and had closed his photography business.  His delinquent debts, \nincluding the failure to pay his mortgage debt, and his various car purchases or leases, \npredate his wife\u2019s medical problems.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  On the Applicant\u2019s side of the issue, \nApplicant is a husband and parent faced with very great health and financial difficulties.  \nHe has a cancer-stricken wife for whom he must care, including driving her 180 miles \nround-trip for treatments for a period of time until he could get the same treatments in \nhis hometown area.  He saw his photography business declining, and sought regular \nemployment three years ago.   \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nOn the financial side of the issue, it is clear his financial difficulties resulted from \na declining business income, and his repeated use of his credit card to finance his \nbusiness and to live on when his business declined.  $17,292 is owed on his credit card, \nand another $38,503 on an equity line of credit.  That totals about $57,000 in debt \nincurred when he should have taken action earlier to decrease his losses.  That action \nis not a responsible one, in addition to not paying his mortgage.  Applicant is a mature \nadult with business experience who should have known what would occur if he \ncontinued as he had been doing in his business.  It is unclear when these debts will be \ndischarged in bankruptcy, or paid outside of bankruptcy.  Therefore, the situation is \ncontinuing.  He voluntarily incurred the debt. \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \nI also conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admission to the sole SOR allegation is incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 32 years old and has been employed as a database administrator by a defense contractor since April 2007. He graduated from high school in May 1994, and served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force as an F-15 crew chief from June 1994 to June 1998. He was awarded an honorable discharge. Applicant worked at a retail store in 1998- 99 while attending a technical college from which he received an associate\u2019s degree. Applicant continued his education while working in the private sector as a systems analyst from May 1999 to October 2000, and as a technology developer from October 2000 to April 2007. He was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. Applicant was married in October 2000. That marriage ended by divorce in February 2002. No children were born of this marriage. Applicant has been remarried since February 2002. He has a three-year-old daughter, a nine-year-old adopted son, and a 13-year-old stepdaughter from this marriage. Individuals who have known Applicant and his family for many years attest to him being a dependable and trustworthy person. (AE 8 and AE 9) Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in March 2008. He listed 48 creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims totaling $213,474 in the petition.

Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by the DOHA on June 20, 2008,\nadmitted the sole SOR allegation and requested a hearing.2\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nNovember 10, 2008\n\n App. Ex. II indicates Department Counsel forwarded three pages of documents to me. He\n3\nsubsequently send me a fourth page (AE 8) with a small handwritten note requesting it be included with\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions and that he also did not object to that document.\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on July 28, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued on\nAugust 15, 2008, scheduling the hearing for September 26, 2008. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted two documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 and admitted into the record without\nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-5 and admitted into the record without objection. The record\nwas held open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation in\nsupport of his case. Four documents were timely received, marked as AE 6-9 and admitted\ninto the record without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding memorandum was\nmarked as App. Ex. II and is included in the file.  The transcript was received on October\n3\n8, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admission to the sole SOR allegation is incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 32 years old and has been employed as a database administrator by\na defense contractor since April 2007. He graduated from high school in May 1994, and\nserved on active duty in the U.S. Air Force as an F-15 crew chief from June 1994 to June\n1998. He was awarded an honorable discharge. Applicant worked at a retail store in 1998-\n99 while attending a technical college from which he received an associate\u2019s degree.\nApplicant continued his education while working in the private sector as a systems analyst\nfrom May 1999 to October 2000, and as a technology developer from October 2000 to April\n2007. He was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007.\nApplicant was married in October 2000. That marriage ended by divorce in February\n2002. No children were born of this marriage. Applicant has been remarried since February\n2002. He has a three-year-old daughter, a nine-year-old adopted son, and a 13-year-old\nstepdaughter from this marriage. Individuals who have known Applicant and his family for\nmany years attest to him being a dependable and trustworthy person. (AE 8 and AE 9)\nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in March 2008. He listed 48\ncreditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims totaling $213,474 in the petition. However,\nthe petition discloses 14 of the listed creditors were not owed anything, the single largest\ncreditor listed was the mortgage company that foreclosed on his former residence which,\nalthough the amount of the claim listed is $138,369, is actually owed nothing, and three\nstudent loans, totaling $32,320, on which collection has been deferred. Additionally, some\naccounts are listed on more than one occasion in the petition. Applicant explained that his\nattorney went through his credit report and listed everything contained in the report. (Tr.\np 54) Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in July 2008. (AE 6)\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n5\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n6\n3\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in or about the latter part of 2005. He\npurchased a residence in 2003 with an adjustable rate mortgage. His original mortgage\npayment of $930 had increased to approximately $1,400 by 2006, and his real estate taxes\nincreased by about 60%. Unable to maintain the payments on the residence and service\nhis other debts, including several credit cards, he immediately sought ways to resolve his\nfinancial dilemma.\nApplicant\u2019s residence was foreclosed on in 2007, after he was unsuccessful in\nefforts to sell the house or work out a payment arrangement with the mortgage company.\nHe moved his family into a home owned by his father-in-law on which he is currently paying\nrent of $1,000. The present rent includes charges for renovations made on the residence\nand will be reduced to $800 at the end of 2008. \nApplicant stopped using most of his credit cards in 2006, and has not acquired any\nnew credit card charge since August 2007. He allowed a vehicle he had been making\npayments on to be repossessed and began driving an older truck that was paid off and a\nvan his father-in-law allowed him to use. He completed a course on personal financial\nmanagement in May 2008. (AE 2) Having obtained the Chapter 7 discharge, Applicant is\nnow debt free except for the student loans. He and his wife have developed a reasonable\nbudget that allows them to live on his income and includes substantial payments on the\nstudent loans and a modest contribution to savings. (AE 7)          \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this\ncase. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n4\n5\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n7\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n11\n Id. at 531.\n12\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n13\n4\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n7\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n8\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n9\nclearance decision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n11\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n12\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant found himself in financial straits beginning in 2005 that eventually caused\nhim to seek Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in March 2008. Disqualifying Conditions (DC)\n19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19C(c): a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused in large part by the dramatic increases\nin his mortgage payments and real estate taxes that occurred in or about 2005. However,\nhaving obtained an adjustable rate mortgage, those are events that Applicant should have\nanticipated. Thus, Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances does not apply.\n\n5\nApplicant took immediate steps to regain control of his finances when he realized\nthe extent of his financial distress. He stopped using credit cards, secured a residence he\ncould afford, and began to live within his financial means. He successfully completed a\nfinancial counselling program, has worked out a reasonable and manageable budget, and\nhe obtained a Chapter 7 discharge that leaves him debt free except for his student loans.\nMC 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; MC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and\nMC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts apply.  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, including Applicant\u2019s appearance and demeanor while testifying,\nthe letters of reference he submitted, the aggressive action he took to bring his finances\nunder control, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the\napplicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn an undated response, received on July 7, 2008, Applicant admitted 14 of 20\nallegations regarding delinquent accounts and denied both allegations pertaining to\npersonal conduct. Applicant declined the opportunity to present her case at a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Materials (FORM), dated August 6,\n2008. Applicant received a copy of the FORM on August 29, 2008, and responded to it\nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n Response to the FORM, dated August 29, 2008.\n1\n Applicant\u2019s husband returned to work in August 2008. Response to the FORM, dated August 29, 2008, at\n2\n3. Applicant does not state whether her husband was intermittently employed between 2002 and August 2008\nor continuously unemployed throughout that six year period. Moreover, in the event the latter is the case, there\nis no explanation as to why his period of unemployment was so protracted.  \n Id.\n3\n Response to the SOR, undated, regarding allegation 1.c. \n4\n2\nby letter dated August 29, 2008. On September 24, 2008, the Director, DOHA,\nassigned the case to me for administrative determination. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, and exhibits, security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old customer support analyst. She has worked for the\nsame defense contractor since 2006. In December 2001, Applicant and her husband\nsecured a mortgage to build a home. Due to a clerical error on the part of the builder,\nthe house delivered was considered an up-grade from the house ordered. While the\nupgrade did not affect their liability for the home, it impacted their taxes and insurance.\nThe week after they closed on the home purchase, Applicant experienced a brief, two\nweek period of unemployment.  At some point in 2002, Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s\n1\ngrandmother was dying. Unable to afford to fly to her, they drove to the grandmother\u2019s\ntown of residence. Their car hydro-planed during a rain storm and was totally wrecked.\nUnbeknownst to them, their car insurance policy lapsed days before they started the\ntrip.\nShortly thereafter, Applicant\u2019s husband lost his job as a loan officer for a\nmortgage company.  Reduced to one income, bills went unpaid or were paid late. As a\n2\nconsequence of not being timely on their mortgage, their mortgage payments doubled\nwhen the loan was accelerated. Applicant could not keep current on the mortgage and,\nin November or December 2002, Applicant received a letter stating they would have to\nvacate the home.  The couple vacated the home and moved to an apartment in which\n3\nthey continued to live through about 2005. In the interim, the house was foreclosed\nupon in January 2004. It was sold and no balance is owed on the home. As well,\nApplicant\u2019s car was repossessed in November 2004. Her credit report shows that the\nfinance company is holding her to the full price of the vehicle; Applicant says she has\ndisputed this, but has provided no documentation to that effect.\nOver the past few years, Applicant has acquired several minor medical debts\nwhich are reflected on her credit report. She characterizes the entries as \u201cgrossly\ninaccurate,\u201d because \u201call payments to my healthcare provider were automatically\ndeducted from my paycheck, and my deductibles were all met.\u201d  She contests these\n4\ncredit report entries/accounts, but has provided no documentation of formal dispute with\neither the credit reporting bureaus or medical providers. Indeed, Applicant questions the\naccuracy of all the delinquent accounts noted in allegations 1.a through 1.t. She states\n\n Item 7 (Response to Interrogatories, dated May 5, 2008) at 1.\n5\n Response to the FORM, dated August 29, 2008, at 4.\n6\n3\nthat she had planned to validate all the charges on her credit report before she received\nthe SOR in June 2008, but did not because it \u201cwould take an incredible amount of time\nand effort. I believe that simply paying for these items without knowing if they are truly\nmy debts would not be fair. . . . I intend to hire someone to look into my credit for me\nbecause with my current workload I simply do not have the time to spend that is needed\nto validate the charges on my own.\u201d5\nApplicant states that she is prepared to pay off the medical accounts noted in\nallegations 1.c ($97), 1.d ($124), 1.f ($70), 1.g ($64), and 1.I ($42), as well as the\ntelecommunications debts noted in allegation 1.k ($190) and 1.m ($142), to show \u201cgood\nfaith.\u201d  She plans to pay all debts at issue. She states that she has discussed some of\n6\nthe accounts with her creditors, but has provided no documentation as to these\ndiscussions. \nIn response to Question 27(b) of her 2007 SF-86 (\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you\nhad your wages garnished or had any property repossessed for any reason?\u201d),\nApplicant answered \u201cno.\u201d In response to the allegation noting her denial of \u201cproperty\nrepossessed,\u201d Applicant stated in her Response to the SOR: \u201cIn regards to [the\nquestion] because it said \u2018property repossessed\u2019 the way this question was worded led\nme to believe that I was to list the foreclosure since there was no other place to list in\non the security clearance application. I know for a fact that . . . repossessions,\ndelinquencies, or charge-offs are all items that would be questioned on an application\nfor credit in regards to employment, etc., therefore I see no reason not to list them.\u201d\nIn response to Question 28(a) (\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debts?\u201d) and Question 28(b) (\u201cAre you currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debts?\u201d), she responded \u201cno.\u201d However, in the space provided for\nadditional comments, Applicant wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t have any known delinquencies, but I am\nsure that there are some.\u201d \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Jan. 27, 1995).\n9\n Id.\n10\n Id.\n11\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n12\n4\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n7\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n8\n9\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n11\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n12\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n13\n5\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) to be the most pertinent to the\ncase. Conditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n13\nunder this guideline.  \nStarting in about 2002, a gaffe in the valuation of a new home increased some\nexpenses, such as home insurance and taxes. Applicant was already facing financial\nproblems when she and her husband had to drive to see his dying grandmother in\n2002. During that trip their car, no longer covered by insurance, was destroyed. Their\nability to timely pay their bills worsened when Applicant\u2019s husband lost his job later that\nyear. All of the delinquent accounts cited in the SOR that were acquired in 2002 and\nsince 2002 remain delinquent and unaddressed. Such facts are sufficient to give rise to\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) apply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Appellant to overcome\nthe case against her and mitigate security concerns. \nIn 2002, through no fault of her own, Applicant\u2019s home builders inadvertently built\nher home at a higher standard. While the upgrades were not added to their home price,\nthey would impact Applicant\u2019s taxes and home insurance. Shortly after closing,\nApplicant was unemployed for two weeks. These two factors were apparently enough of\na threat to the couple\u2019s financial stability that they had to drive, rather than fly, to see\nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s ill grandmother. Her husband became unemployed later in 2002\nand either remained unemployed or worked intermittently until he found a permanent\nposition in August 2008. His unemployment clearly impacted their already tenuous\nability to pay their bills. Additionally, a car accident completely wrecked one automobile\nin 2002, days after their insurance had lapsed. To the extent such facts led to the\nacquisition of delinquent debt, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 2,\n\n ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008).\n14\n6\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances) applies.\nOf the 20 financial allegations raised in the SOR, there are 18 delinquent debts\ncited. To date, none have been paid, in full or in part, and there is no documentary\nevidence indicating any have been formally disputed. As for Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s\nperiod of unemployment, it understandably contributed to the family\u2019s difficulty in\nmeeting their obligations. Applicant failed, however, to document or discuss any unique\naspects of his unemployment that kept those accounts delinquent for six years or that\nprohibited him from returning to stable employment sooner. Moreover, although\nApplicant is suspicious of the accuracy of her credit report, no explanation is given as to\nwhy she has not yet started validating its entries except that it would take \u201can incredible\namount of time and effort\u201d and she does not have such time available. Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) does not apply. \nTo date, the accounts at issue remain unpaid and there is no documentary\nevidence any have been formally disputed with the credit reporting bureaus. At most,\nApplicant has stated she will soon make payments on some of the smaller balances,\nmost of which are under $100, to show her good faith. Statements of a future intent to\npay debts carry little weight in these analyses  and this process cannot be extended\n14\nindefinitely in order to meet an applicant\u2019s payment schedule. In the absence of\ndocumented evidence a good faith effort to repay creditors has been made or that\nApplicant has otherwise initiated some  effort to resolve her debts, FC MC 4, AG \u00b6\n20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) does not apply. Furthermore, because Applicant failed to identify\nwhether she has received financial counseling, FC MC 3, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control) cannot apply. \nApplicant\u2019s argument relies largely on the unfortunate incidents that occurred in\n2002 and the financial repercussions that have followed her into the present. To the\nextent her foreclosure, repossession, and delinquent accounts were caused by these\nunforeseeable events, mitigation has been noted. They do not, however, relieve\nApplicant of honoring her obligations with some degree of diligence. Several of these\ndebts are for less than $100. In six years, Applicant has not pursued any of these debts\nto the extent documentation of negotiation, dispute, or payment exists. Nor is there\nevidence that Applicant has sought professional counseling to help her address these\naccounts. Lacking evidence of any concrete efforts to repay or resolve these debts,\nfinancial considerations security concerns remain unmitigated.\n\n7\nPersonal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate\nthat the person may not properly safeguard classified information. In completing her\nSF-86, Appellant marked the box designated as a \u201cno\u201d in response to the question of\nwhether she had any delinquent accounts. In the additional space provided, however,\nshe wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t have any known delinquencies, but I am sure that there are some.\u201d\nThe juxtaposition of these two answers does not, as argued by Department Counsel,\nshow that Applicant was hedging her bets. Rather, it is a clear expression that she\ncould not identify or did not then know of any delinquencies, but that she was \u201csure\u201d\nthat there were some. Regardless, taken together, her answers clearly put investigators\non notice that there were delinquencies which ultimately is the point of the question. \nAs for the question regarding repossessions, Applicant\u2019s explanation is\nadamantly written with conviction. It is difficult to understand, however, without multiple\nreadings. It is Applicant\u2019s position that by putting investigators on notice that delinquent\naccounts existed, investigators could and would examine her credit report. In turn, that\nreport would reveal any and all liens, delinquencies, repossessions, charge offs, etc.\nmore accurately than her own memory could recollect. While this may not be the ideal\nway to answer the question, it is not dissimilar to the applicant who notes full details\nabout a bankruptcy discharge, but fails to enumerate each account included in the\npetition. The point is, notice was sufficiently given and there is no indication that\nApplicant intentionally tried to mislead the government. Lacking evidence that she\ndeliberately omitted, concealed, or falsified relevant facts, none of the disqualifying\nconditions raised under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \n\n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\npublic trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature woman with a busy work schedule that limits her free\ntime. She and her husband first encountered financial problems in 2002 when an\nincrease in the value of their home was reflected their insurance and taxes, and after\nApplicant experienced two weeks of unemployment. Their financial problems\ndramatically worsened when Applicant\u2019s husband lost his job. Consequently, a number\nof delinquencies, a foreclosure, and a repossession followed.\nIn the six intervening years, none of the accounts noted in the SOR were\naddressed in any demonstrable manner. None of the debts have been paid, despite the\nfact many are for balances of less than $100. No documentation was introduced\nshowing Applicant ever contacted her creditors, explained her situation, or solicited\ncooperation in addressing her debt. There is no tangible evidence that Applicant ever\nproposed a repayment plan on some or all of the accounts. There is no documentary\nevidence she ever sought counseling that might result in a debt consolidation. Although\nApplicant suspects some of the balances reflected are incorrect, she provided no\ncorroborative evidence showing she ever formally disputed any of these accounts with\neither a creditor or one of the credit reporting bureaus. \nApplicant cites to her financially bleak past in asking for more time to address\nthese debts. As a measure of good faith, she promises to soon pay off some debts she\nfeels are erroneously represented on her credit report, but has been too busy to\nvalidate. The Appeal Board, however, has spoken as to the weight to be given to\npromises to pay in the future. Moreover, Applicant has already postponed addressing\nsome of these debts for as long as six years and, in that same amount of time, has\nbeen unable to find the time to validate her credit report. Such procrastination with\nregard to one\u2019s financial obligations reflects poor judgment at best. Failing to provide\ndocumentation of any good faith efforts to address these debts, Applicant failed to meet\nher burden in mitigating financial considerations security concerns. In contrast,\nhowever, there is no indication that Applicant deliberately attempted to mislead the\ngovernment in her denial of delinquencies and repossessions on her SF-86. Her\ncomment in the additional space indicating that she was \u201csure\u201d there were, in fact,\ndelinquencies conceded that delinquent accounts existed. It also put investigators on\nnotice to check her credit report for other financial failures. Absent evidence of a\ndeliberate attempt to mislead, no personal conduct security concerns are raised. With\nsecurity concerns remaining as to her finances, however, I conclude it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance\nis denied. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In the amended SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline F (financial considerations) that the state had issued three tax liens against him for failure to pay delinquent state taxes totaling $21,647 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c), and that he owed delinquent federal taxes of about $22,593 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), three medical debts totaling an additional $1,647 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g) in collection, a $50 debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h), charged off balances totaling $5,388 on two credit card accounts with the same lender (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.k), and a deficiency balance of about $10,574 following the repossession of his automobile (SOR \u00b6 1.j), and that he had failed to file his federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2002 through 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). DOHA alleged under Guideline E (personal conduct) that Applicant falsified his e- QIP by denying any financial delinquencies over 180 days in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and any property repossessions in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted all the allegations but SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 2.b. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 53-year-old mechanical designer who has been employed by a business and professional services agency (\u201cjob shop\u201d) since September 2007.

On May 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F and Guideline E that provided the basis for its\ndecision to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative\njudge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR allegations in writing on June 18, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. On July 9, 2008, the case\nwas assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n2\nto grant or continue a security clearance for him. On July 15, 2008, I scheduled a\nhearing for August 14, 2008.\n \nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Five government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and five\nApplicant exhibits (Ex. A-E) were admitted, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a\ntranscript (Tr.) received on August 26, 2008. Based on a review of the pleadings,\nexhibits, and hearing testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive, Department Counsel moved before closing\nargument to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence. Specifically, the government\nmoved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.d by substituting the following allegation of an IRS tax lien,\nand to add a new allegation under SOR \u00b6 1.l for failure to file timely federal and state\nincome tax returns:\n1.d. An IRS tax lien in the amount of approximately $22,593 was entered against\nyou on July 4, 2008. As of August 14, 2008, this debt had not been paid.\n1.l. You have failed to file either federal or state tax returns for the tax years 2002\nto 2006.\nApplicant did not object and the motions were granted.\n \nFindings of Fact\nIn the amended SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline F (financial considerations)\nthat the state had issued three tax liens against him for failure to pay delinquent state\ntaxes totaling $21,647 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c), and that he owed delinquent federal\ntaxes of about $22,593 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), three medical debts totaling an additional $1,647\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g) in collection, a $50 debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h), charged off\nbalances totaling $5,388 on two credit card accounts with the same lender (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i\nand 1.k), and a deficiency balance of about $10,574 following the repossession of his\nautomobile (SOR \u00b6 1.j), and that he had failed to file his federal or state income tax\nreturns for tax years 2002 through 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.l).\nDOHA alleged under Guideline E (personal conduct) that Applicant falsified his e-\nQIP by denying any financial delinquencies over 180 days in the last seven years (SOR\n\u00b6 2.a) and any property repossessions in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant\nadmitted all the allegations but SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 2.b. After considering the evidence of\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 53-year-old mechanical designer who has been employed by a\nbusiness and professional services agency (\u201cjob shop\u201d) since September 2007. He\n\nApplicant initially testified that his last income tax filing before tax year 2007 was for tax year 2000 (Tr. 47).\n1\nHe later corrected it to indicate that he had not filed for tax years 2002 to 2006 (Tr. 48). Yet, under the terms\nof the retainer agreement with a tax resolution firm, the company was to prepare his federal and state income\ntax returns for tax years 2001 though 2006 (Ex. 2). There is some indication that he may have filed for 2001\nand 2002, in that the state and federal government filed liens against him for failure to pay delinquent taxes.\nThere is no evidence that the IRS or the state filed any substitute returns (Tr. 60).\n3\nrequires a security clearance for his duties at a defense contractor facility. He had\npreviously been self-employed as a designer/design engineer (Ex. 1).\nIn about March 1998, Applicant began working as a consultant design engineer\nfor a local company (Ex. 1). Originally placed there through a \u201cjob shop\u201d at an hourly\nwage of about $46, he contracted directly with the company as a self-employed\nconsultant at about $51 per hour. His wage rate gradually increased to about $53 hourly\nfor a 40-hour work week (Tr. 36, 39-40).\nStarting in tax year 1999, Applicant did not set aside the funds to pay his\nquarterly income taxes (Tr. 49). In about 2000, he and his spouse separated. Applicant\npaid his spouse an amount needed to maintain the household and provide for their two\nchildren (Tr. 50-51). Applicant stopped filing his federal and state income tax returns\nbecause he did not have the funds to pay the taxes owed.  In about early 2002, he\n1\nentered into agreements with the state and the IRS to make payments on his back\ntaxes, but paid for less than one year (Tr. 51-53). He and his spouse divorced in April\n2002 (Ex. 1). He no longer had to cover her mortgage (Tr. 91), but starting in\nSeptember 2002, Applicant was under court order to pay child support for his two\ndaughters (Ex. 3). Applicant made child support for his two daughters until the elder,\nwho is now 16, came to live with him. His child support obligation was eventually\neliminated (Tr. 44).\nIn 2002, Appellant incurred three medical debts of $50, $1016, and $581 (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g) that were subsequently referred for collection. As of April 2008, the\ndebts were still unpaid (Ex. 4).\nApplicant made no payments after April 2003 on two revolving charge accounts\n(one joint, the other individual) with a bank (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.k). In December 2004, a\npast due balance of $1,728 was charged off on the joint account. In January 2005, the\ndebt was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.k). In October 2007, a $3,400 past due balance\non his individual account was referred for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.i) (Ex. 3, Tr. 69). \nIn May 2003, the state filed a notice of a tax lien against him for failing to pay\ndelinquent income taxes owed for tax years 1999, 2000, and 2001 totaling $8,064.77. In\nAugust 2006, the state filed a notice of a tax lien against him for a past due balance of\n$5,056.86 for tax year 2002. In March 2006, the state filed yet another lien against him\n\nDOHA alleged and Applicant admitted the imposition of three state tax liens for unpaid taxes totaling $21,647\n2\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). The March 2006 tax lien of $8,527.15 was filed for unpaid \u201cW ITH INC\u201d (withholding income)\nfor the periods ending September 30, 2001, and June 30, 2002, as assessed on December 2005. It is not\nclear whether it represents an additional $8,527.15 in income tax debt, or whether it was an updated balance\nassessment for 2001 and 2002. Available records indicate that as of May 2003, he owed back state income\ntaxes of $1,658.65 for 1999, $3,356.41 for 2000, and $3,049.71 for 2001. As of August 2006, he owed an\nadditional $5,056.86 for 2002. Applicant\u2019s May 2008 credit report lists the two tax liens in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c\nplus a tax debt of $3,124 in collection (Ex. 4).\n4\nin the amount of $8,527.15 for failure to pay income withholding for the third quarter of\n2001 and the second quarter of 2002 (Ex. 3, Ex. 5).2\nIn November 2006, a $10,574 deficiency balance on his auto loan, remaining\nafter a repossession of his vehicle, was referred for collection (Ex. 3). Applicant had\nfallen behind two months in his $600 monthly payments (Tr. 72-73) so he voluntarily\nsurrendered it. As of April 2008, the debt had not been paid (Ex. 4).\nApplicant was steadily employed as an independent consultant on a full-time\nbasis from March 1998 until April 2007 (Ex. 1), when the company he serviced was\nacquired by a larger firm that had a different policy on contractors. Applicant\u2019s\nemployment contract was terminated. Over the next few months, he took whatever work\nhe was offered. Some weeks he had earned income, other weeks none (Tr. 37-39).\nIn mid-August 2007, Applicant contacted a tax resolution firm for assistance in\nresolving his delinquent federal and state tax issues. Under the terms of the proposed\nretainer agreement, in return for a flat fee of $7,000, the company was to prepare his\nfederal and state individual income tax returns for tax years 2001 through 2006, to\nattempt to prevent future seizure of assets, and to attempt to negotiate on his behalf\nwith the IRS and the state tax authority. In return Applicant was to make prompt\npayments and file returns as required, to stay current on all future tax liabilities as they\nbecome due, and to respond timely to taxing agencies\u2019 requests for information and\ndocuments (Ex. 2). Following an initial payment of $1,000, Applicant was to make\nmonthly payments of $750. Applicant paid about $2,500, but he did not follow through\nwith the agreement due to the cost (Tr. 55-56). He borrowed the $1,000 for the initial\nretainer from his sister, and two payments of $750 were automatically withdrawn from\nhis bank account (Tr. 56).\nIn September 2007, Applicant became a W-2 employee and was placed at a\ndefense contractor facility. On October 11, 2007, he executed an e-QIP on which he\nresponded \u201cYes\u201d to question 27.c. \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed\nagainst your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?\u201d and indicated that the\nstate filed a lien against him in March 2006 for a $6,000 tax debt. He added that he was\nworking with a debt resolution firm to reach a settlement and payment plan. Applicant\nresponded \u201cNo\u201d to any repossessions with the past seven years (27.b), to any debts\nover 180 days delinquent in the last seven years (28.a), and to any debts currently over\n90 days delinquent (28.b) (Ex. 1). A check of Applicant\u2019s credit on October 18, 2007,\n\nIt also reported that Applicant owed back child support of $4,145 as of September 2007. That debt does not\n3\nappear on his May 2008 credit report (Ex. 4) and Applicant explained that he had made the payments and\nproved it in court (Tr. 87-88). The government did not allege that Applicant was in arrears in child support.\nThis entry in the credit report likely provided the basis for the government\u2019s original SOR \u00b6 1.d. It is unclear\n4\nwhether the credit bureau was reporting a  federal or a state tax debt. The IRS records provided by Applicant\nshow his federal tax debt is a much greater $22,593.92 as of July 2008, and this does not include whatever\nApplicant may owe for the years where he has yet to file his returns.\n5\nrevealed that the tax liens and several other collection debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1-e-1.k) had not\nbeen satisfied (Ex. 3).3\nOn March 18, 2008, DOHA forwarded financial interrogatories to Applicant,\nasking him about the status of the state tax liens (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c), the $1,728 credit\ncard delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.k), and three medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.g). On May 12,\n2008, he indicated in response that he was working with the debt resolution company to\nresolve his state and federal tax issues, and that he would pay off the $50 medical bill\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e) in June 2008. Applicant explained that the deficiency balance was from a\ncar loan following voluntary repossession, and that he could not repay the $1,728 credit\ncard past due balance until his other debts were cleared up. Applicant denied any\nknowledge of the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. Applicant provided the retainer\nagreement with the debt resolution firm, a current earnings statement showing an hourly\nwage of $46 and weekly net pay of $1,256.01, and a personal financial statement in\nwhich he estimated a net monthly remainder of $2,934 (Ex. 2).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on May 21, 2008, revealed a $3,124 tax balance in\ncollection,  as well as the unpaid tax liens in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. It showed no progress\n4\ntoward resolving the delinquent consumer credit accounts. With his brother-in-law\u2019s\nassistance (Tr. 57), he filed both his federal and state income tax returns for tax year\n2007, and was entitled to a federal refund. He had underpaid his state taxes by about\n$500 (Tr. 53-54). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intercepted $738 of his income\ntax refund for tax year 2007 to satisfy delinquent taxes for tax year 2000 (Ex. C). On\nMay 19, 2008, an overpayment of $659.87 was intercepted and applied toward his back\ntaxes for 2001 (Ex. D). The economic stimulus payment of $900 that he was to receive\nby June 13, 2008, was also taken by the IRS and applied to reduce the amount owed\nfor tax year 2001 (Ex. A, Ex. B). On July 4, 2008, the IRS filed a lien against him\nbecause of unpaid taxes of $5,376.60 for tax year 2001 and $17,217.32 for tax year\n2002 (Ex. E).\nAs of August 2008, Applicant had not filed his federal or state income tax returns\nfor tax years 2002 through 2006 (Tr. 48). He was working on filing them with his brother-\nin-law, who is an accountant (Tr. 57). Applicant intends on \u201cmoving in a forward, positive\ndirection of slowing getting rid of [his tax] debt\u201d (Tr. 64). He plans to obtain financial\ncounseling but has not yet done so (Tr. 64). He disputes the $50 collection debt in SOR\n\u00b6 1.h because he does not recognize it. He plans to inquire about that debt, which\nappears on his credit report (Tr. 69), but has not yet contacted the credit bureaus or\ncreditor. As of December 2007, Applicant had no intent of repaying the deficiency\n\n6\nbalance of his car loan because it had been charged off by the creditor. He changed his\nmind and plans to pay it off (Tr. 74).\nBetween May 2006 and October 2007, Applicant opened four credit card\naccounts with limits ranging from $300 to $500 (Ex. 4, Tr. 71). As of April/May 2008, the\nfour accounts had an aggregate balance of $1,397, and were rated as current (Ex. 4),\nalthough he had fallen behind \u201ca month or two here and there\u201d (Tr. 93).\nApplicant does not own a car. He lives with his fiancee and he uses her vehicle\nwhen needed. For almost the last two years, they have pooled their money to pay their\njoint expenses. She was paid $10 an hour but recently was promoted to a managerial\njob at $17 an hour (Tr. 75). Applicant\u2019s fiancee has a daughter that lives with them (Tr.\n76). As of August 2008, Applicant was paying all his bills by money order (Tr. 77). He\nopened a passbook savings account in which the balance has never exceeded $80 (Tr.\n78). Applicant anticipates that better budgeting will give him the funds to resolve his\ndebts (Tr. 89). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\nIn March 2006, the state filed a lien for $8,527.15 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) for taxes reportedly owed for 2001 and\n5\n2002.The May 2003 tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.a)  was filed because of unpaid state income taxes for 1999, 2000, and\n2001. It is unclear whether the $8,567 is an updated balance of his state income tax delinquency for 2001 and\n2002, or even whether it was filed for failure to withhold income for the child support arrearage that he\nsuccessfully disputed. His May 2008 credit report includes only the March and August 2006 tax liens (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c), and neither party offered any clarification. It can be inferred that he owes more than $13,000\nin delinquent state taxes as of August 2008.\n7\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant worked full-time for one employer for about nine years, from March\n1998 until April 2007, for most of that time as an independent contractor. He failed to set\naside sufficient income to pay his federal and/or state income tax obligations starting in\ntax year 1999, and as a consequence owes more than $13,000 in delinquent state\ntaxes,  as well as $22,593 in delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2001 and 2002,\n5\nexcluding any assessments for tax years 2003 through 2006. He failed to file his federal\nor state income tax returns for those tax years (SOR \u00b6 1.l), and there is no indication\nthat he paid any taxes on his income for those years when he was working full-time at\nan hourly wage of at least $46.\n\n8\nIn addition, Applicant owes three medical debts in collection totaling $1,647 (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.g), a $10,547 deficiency balance on an auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.j), and $5,388 in\ndelinquent credit card debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.k). Significant security concerns are\nraised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)), by \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)), and \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or\nlocal income tax returns as required\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(g)). Although the $50 collection debt\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h is listed on Applicant\u2019s credit reports, it is insufficient to prove\nApplicant\u2019s liability where he disputes the debt and the credit information is from June\n2003.\nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the other debts and his failure to timely file\nfederal and state income tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d) clearly does not apply. He has not yet filed his delinquent returns or made\nany payments on his consumer credit debts. While he entered into an agreement with a\ntax resolution firm to assist him in resolving his federal and state income tax issues,  AG\n\u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u201d) cannot be fully applied where he did not keep up with the\npayments required. AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) is pertinent only to the April 2007\nto September 2007 time frame. Following the termination of his employment contract in\nApril 2007, he found work when he could over the next few months. Lack of a steady\nincome during that time extenuates his failure to make any payments on his debt during\nthat period. However, the debts at issue in this case became delinquent when Applicant\nhad earned income from full-time (40 hours per week) employment. AG \u00b6 20(b) does\nnot apply when the delinquencies are due to poor budgeting and then years of\ndisregard. Even with his child support payments, he earned sufficient income to make\nsome payments on his delinquencies. As recently as December 2007, Applicant did not\nintend to repay the credit card balances or the car loan deficiency.\nWhile he filed his 2007 federal and state income tax returns on time, and now\nintends to repay his delinquent taxes and consumer credit accounts, it is too soon to\nsafely conclude that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control\u201d (see AG \u00b6 20(d)). He has made no payments on his consumer credit\ndebts. Payments have been applied toward his federal tax debt through IRS interception\nof refunds, including of the $900 due to him under the economic stimulus plan. He\nremains under a significant debt burden that is only likely to grow in the near future, as\nback taxes are assessed for the tax years 2003 through 2006. Despite an estimated net\nmonthly remainder of $2,934 as of May 2008, he has little to no cash in reserve with\nwhich to make payments on his debts. He had to borrow $1,000 from his sister to pay\nthe tax resolution firm\u2019s retainer fee. When asked at his hearing about possible sources\nof funding for debt repayment, Applicant responded, \u201cI think it can be done by getting\nfinancial advice, and learning how to budget and just cutting back on anything that is,\n\n9\nyou know, might be able to be cut back on.\u201d (Tr. 89). He has yet to obtain the financial\ncounseling that he recognizes he needs. Promises, however sincere, are not entitled to\nthe same weight in mitigation as concrete actions taken in reform.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhen Applicant applied for his security clearance in October 2007, he listed a\nstate tax lien of $6,000 in response to question 27.c, but as alleged by the government,\nhe responded \u201cNo\u201d to question 27.b, any property repossessed in the last 7 years, and\nto question 28.a, any debts over 180 days delinquent in the last 7 years. The knowing\nand willful omission/concealment of information required to be reported on an SF 86\nfalls within AG \u00b6 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d).\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports show a delinquent debt of $10,574 owed to an\nautomobile lender. Applicant has not denied that the debt represents a deficiency\nbalance but maintains that he voluntarily brought the car to the dealer when he\ndetermined he could not afford the payment. He explained that he did not think the\nrepossession question applied to him because he initiated the surrender of the vehicle\n(Tr. 82). His October 2007 credit report shows the debt as a deficiency but not as an\ninvoluntary repossession. Under the facts presented, I accept Applicant\u2019s explanation\nand conclude he did not intentionally conceal the surrender of his vehicle.\nApplicant has a more difficult burden to overcome the reasonable inference of\nknowing falsification that can be drawn from his negative response to question 28.a,\nhowever. The IRS had not yet issued its tax lien as of October 2007 when Applicant\ncompleted his security clearance application. On the other hand, he also knew that he\nhad unresolved federal tax issues because he had retained the tax resolution firm to\ndeal with the IRS as well as the state tax authority (Tr. 87). Furthermore, two or three\nmonths after he voluntarily surrendered his vehicle, he was informed he would be\nresponsible for any deficiency balance on the loan (\u201cYeah, they told me that. I didn\u2019t\nknow it would be $10,000 though.\u201d Tr. 74). He does not dispute owing the two credit\ncard delinquencies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.k) since 2003 (Tr. 70).\n\n10\nWhen he answered the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a regarding\nfalsification of question 28.a on his e-QIP. When asked at his hearing to explain, he\nprovided no reason for his negative response to 28.a (\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Tr. 84). He later\nadded that he could not see himself deliberately lying, that he \u201cwas not thinking about\nthem at all, not trying to hide anything or thinking that, you know, you would never find\nout about it.\u201d (Tr. 85). Applicant had an obligation of full candor independent of whether\nthe government could learn of his debts through other means. Had Applicant simply\nfailed to recollect the debts, he likely would have indicated so and/or denied SOR \u00b6 2.a\nwhen he answered the SOR, as he denied \u00b6 2.b. Under the facts presented, I find AG \u00b6\n16(a) applies.\nApplicant was candid about his debts when he answered the SOR and at his\nhearing. No report or statement from his December 2007 interview with a government\ninvestigator was made available for my review, but Applicant confirmed he discussed\nhis tax liens, the credit card debts, and the vehicle repossession with the investigator\n(Tr. 94). A good-faith attempt to correct the record in December 2007 would be\nsufficiently prompt to fall within mitigating condition AG \u00b617(a) (\u201cthe individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts\u201d). When asked why he took no action to obtain financial\ncounseling in June or July 2008 after he received the SOR, Applicant responded, \u201cWell,\nI guess I, until I had to, you know, read my credit report and see all of this mess that I\u2019m\nin, I guess I was denying it or ignoring it, or just hoping it would go away somehow. . . .\u201d\n(Tr. 90). Disclosure prompted by review of a credit report does not fully satisfy AG \u00b6\n17(a), which requires correction before confrontation with the adverse information. None\nof the other potentially mitigating conditions under Guideline E are pertinent.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n\nA finding is warranted against Applicant on the basis of the documented tax lien (Ex. 5). W hether or not he\n6\nowes all or a portion of the amount alleged, the government established that the state filed a tax lien against\nhim for failure to pay taxes when they were owed. Applicant failed to prove that the lien was filed in error.\n11\nApplicant did not pay federal or state income taxes for tax years 1999 through\n2006. He did not file timely returns for at least tax years 2003 through 2006. As a\nconsequence of his knowing and repeated failure to comply with is legal obligation to file\nreturns and pay taxes, he owes at least $35,000 in back taxes. His irresponsibility\nextended to his handling of consumer credit accounts as well, and he owes an\nadditional $17,609 in past due balances. He exhibited good faith in seeking the services\nof a tax resolution firm in August 2007 (AG \u00b6 2(a)(6)), but did not follow through with the\nagreement. Over the past two years, he has shared his household expenses with his\nfiancee. From a reported net monthly remainder of $2,934, only about $80 gets\ndeposited into savings, but even that is spent. There is little to guarantee that he will be\nable to resolve his considerable debt in the near future where he has yet to show a\nfavorable change in his financial habits. He has not obtained the financial counseling\nthat he acknowledges he needs. The concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment are\ncompounded by his failure to disclose his delinquent consumer debt on his e-QIP.\nUnder the facts presented, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the amended SOR, as required by\nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant6\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k :\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "findings of fact: Applicant is a software developer and consultant for a Department of Defense contractor. After graduating from college in 1980 he worked for a state government, retiring from that job in 1993. Following retirement he set up his own business related to information technology. When he expanded his business activities, it did not generate enough revenue to pay operating expenses, in light of changes in the market. He used his personal income to pay employees, with a result that he was not able to pay his personal bills. His business ultimately failed. Applicant experienced financial troubles as well as tax problems. He and his wife divorced. They sold their house to pay off debts. Proceeds from this sale paid off Applicant\u2019s tax liens. He now lives with his parents to save money. His income is such that he nets $3,584 a month after expenses. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts for credit cards, etc. The total amounts owed on those debts for which the Judge found against Applicant exceed $18,000. Additionally, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d on questions on his security clearance application which inquired about debts over 180 days delinquent and about any tax liens against him. These answers were not true. The Board has considered the issues which Applicant has raised on appeal.

On June 18, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 31, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mary E. Henry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nfiled a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application of the\nGuideline F and E Mitigating Conditions was erroneous; whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nwas erroneous; and whether Applicant was denied the due process rights secured him by the\nDirective.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a software developer\nand consultant for a Department of Defense contractor.  After graduating from college in 1980 he\nworked for a state government, retiring from that job in 1993.  Following retirement he set up his\nown business related to information technology.  When he expanded his business activities, it did\nnot generate enough revenue to pay operating expenses, in light of changes in the market.  He used\nhis personal income to pay employees, with a result that he was not able to pay his personal bills.\nHis business ultimately failed.  Applicant experienced financial troubles as well as tax problems.\nHe and his wife divorced.  They sold their house to pay off debts.  Proceeds from this sale paid off\nApplicant\u2019s tax liens.  He now lives with his parents to save money.  His income is such that he nets\n$3,584 a month after expenses. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts for credit cards, etc.  The total amounts owed on\nthose debts for which the Judge found against Applicant exceed $18,000.  Additionally, Applicant\nanswered \u201cno\u201d on questions on his security clearance application which inquired about debts over\n180 days delinquent and about any tax liens against him.  These answers were not true.  \nThe Board has considered the issues which Applicant has raised on appeal.  Concerning\nApplicant\u2019s claim that his due process rights were compromised by his self-representation, the record\ndemonstrates that Applicant received detailed pre-hearing guidance from DOHA explaining his\nrights.  Among other things, he was advised of his right to employ counsel, or to have some other\nperson represent him at the hearing; his right to present evidence and witnesses; his right to cross-\nexamine witnesses against him; and his right to object to evidence.  A review of the entire record\ndiscloses no basis to conclude that Applicant was denied the rights due him under the Directive or\nthat he had not been adequately advised of those rights.  See Tr. at 4-8.  \u201cHaving decided to represent\nhimself during the proceedings below, Applicant cannot fairly complain about the quality of his self-\nrepresentation or seek to be relieved of the consequences of his decision to represent himself.\u201d  ISCR\nCase No. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \nThe record demonstrates that the Judge considered appropriate mitigating conditions, holding\nin favor of Applicant as to several of the Guideline F and Guideline E allegations.  However, she\nconcluded that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to the remaining allegations.\nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  She paid attention to the fact that Applicant had over $3,000 in income\neach month after expenses yet had not made reasonable efforts to satisfy his creditors.  Viewed in\n\nSee, e.g., Decision at 9:  \u201cApplicant has not acted with due diligence to resolve his remaining outstanding debts,\n1\ndespite availability of almost $3,000 a month after his expenses are paid.  Applicant\u2019s failure to honestly answer\nquestions about his finances raises questions about his trustworthiness.  He has not demonstrated a rational reason for\nhis decision to answer \u2018no\u2019 to two financial questions on his security clearance application.  His failure at his hearing to\ncandidly explain why he provided a false SF-86 remains a security concern.\u201d  \nlight of the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusion concerning mitigation is sustainable.\nThe Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is also sustainable.   See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App.\n1\nBd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto.\nIns.

On June 18, 2008 , the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and E\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 30, 2008.

DOHA received the request shortly thereafter. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on July 17, 2008, and I received the case assignment on August 4,\n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 15, 2008, which Applicant received\non August 20, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 8, 2008. The\ngovernment offered 13 exhibits (GE) 1 through 13, which were received and admitted\ninto evidence without objection. Applicant and one witness testified on his behalf. He\nsubmitted six exhibits (AE) A through F, which were received and admitted into\nevidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nSeptember 15, 2008. I held the record open until September 30, 2008, for Applicant to\nsubmit additional matters.  On September 30, 2008, he submitted additional documents,\nwhich are marked as AE G through R, and admitted without objection. On October 8,\n2008, Applicant requested permission to submit an additional document. I granted his\nrequest. The next day Applicant submitted AE S, which has been admitted into the\nrecord without objection. The record closed on October 9, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 14, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.I, 1.n, and 1.q of the SOR. He denied the remaining factual\nallegations in the SOR.\nApplicant, who is 51-years-old, works as a software developer and consultant for\na Department of Defense. He has worked for this employer since December 2006.1\nApplicant graduated from college in 1980 with a degree in engineering\ntechnology. Following graduation, he worked for the state government until 1993, when\nhe retired. Shortly before his retirement, he married. He has no children.2\nFollowing his retirement, Applicant worked for two companies briefly, then\ndecided to establish his own business. He set up a Subchapter S corporation related to\ninformation technology (IT) in the middle 1990s. His wife continued to work full-time at\nher job, while he developed his business. He obtained long-term contracts and\neventually started to make some money. In the late 1990s, he decided to develop a\nsecond business and convinced his wife to leave her job to operate the first business.\nHe rented office space, hired a marketing person, obtained more work contracts, and\nhired employees. Over time and due to a change in the business market, his contracts\ndid not generate sufficient revenue to pay all the expenses needed to operate the\nsecond business. He used his personal income to pay his employees, which resulted in\nhis inability to pay his own personal bills. The change in the business market and\nresulting loss of revenues ultimately caused his businesses to fail.3\n\nGE 2 (Interrogatories and answers by Applicant plus attachments); AE B (Certificate of Release of Federal\n4\nTax Lien, dated September 20, 2006); AEs C, G and H (Verification of State Tax Lien identified in GE 6); AEs\nG and H  (Verification of State Tax Lien identified in GE 7); AEs D and G (Verification of State Tax Lien\nidentified in GE 10); Tr. 36-37.\nGE 2, supra note 4, at 5.; Tr. at 76-80.\n5\nAccordingly, I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.l, and 1.m to eliminate the duplication.\n6\nGE 4 (Credit report, dated January 9, 2007) at 13, 14; Tr. 40, 58-62, 65-68.\n7\nGE 3 (Credit report, dated April 1, 2008); AE A (Credit report, dated September 5, 2008) at 11; Tr. 40-47.\n8\n3\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems with his businesses created tax issues and\nfinancial problems at home. He and his wife separated in 2005 and are now divorced. In\n2006, he and his wife decided to sell their home and use the proceeds to pay off debts.\nThe proceeds from the sale of the house paid his federal tax lien, state tax liens, and\nthe mortgages on the house. Applicant received almost $13,000 in sale proceeds once\nhis tax liens and mortgages had been paid. He did not provide information which\nreflects that this money paid other debts not listed in the SOR.4\nThree months ago, Applicant moved into his parents house to save money. He\nalso helps his parents with the care of his grandmother, who is 101 years old. His gross\nmonthly income is $7,520 a month and his net monthly income is $5,884 a month. His\nmonthly expenses total approximately $2,300, leaving a net remainder of $3,584.5\nConcerning the remaining debts listed in the SOR, Department Counsel agreed,\nat the hearing, that the debts listed in SOR allegation 1.a. and 1.n are the same and in\nSOR allegations 1.l, 1.m and 1.p belong to the same creditor.  These two debts total\n6\n$10,754 and are unpaid.7\nApplicant admitted that he owed, but has not paid the debts listed in SOR\nallegations 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.i, and 1.q, which total $4,032. These debts relate to credit\ncards, except for 1.q, which is a medical bill. The September 2008 credit report\nindicates a zero balance for the debt listed in allegation 1.b. Applicant denied owing the\ndebts listed in SOR allegations 1.e and 1.r, totaling $1,950, in his response to the SOR,\nbut acknowledged the debts at the hearing. Applicant denies any knowledge of the\njudgment in allegation 1.e. He believes a former employee obtained computer parts\nfrom another company without his knowledge and charged the purchase to his\ncompany. He did not receive any notice of a pending court action and did not appear in\ncourt to contest the case. He recently disputed this judgment with the credit reporting\nagency as not valid, but has not disputed the debt with the court. He stated that he tried\nto locate the creditor, but could not. These debts are not paid.   \n8\nApplicant believes that two judgments listed in SOR allegations 1.f and 1.h are\nthe same. The record reflects that the creditor for the debt in allegation 1.h obtained a\njudgment in 1998 and a second judgment for a lesser amount in 1999. Applicant also\n\nGE 9 (Information sheet on judgment); GE 11 (Information sheet on judgment); AE M (Mortgage satisfaction\n9\nline); AE O (Mortgage); AE S (Credit report, dated October 4, 2008) at 2; Tr. 47-48,\nTr. 72-76.\n10\nId. at 84-92.\n11\nAE F (Letter, dated September 3, 2008); Tr. 115-118.\n12\n4\nbelieved he paid these judgments a long time ago, but has not provided proof of\npayment. Applicant denied owing money to the insurance company identified as the\ncreditor in SOR allegation 1.o and challenged this debt. As a result of his challenge, the\ndebt has been removed from his credit report. I find that this debt is not owed by him.\nHis most recent credit report indicates a charge off in the amount of $3,206 for a bank,\nwhich is not listed in the SOR. His evidence indicates this bank has been paid in full.\nThere are other debts on his newest credit report, which are not paid and not listed in\nthe SOR.  \n9\nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application in December 2006,\nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 27c, 27d, 28a, and 28b, which concern the existence of\ndelinquent debts and tax liens. Applicant denies that he deliberately falsified his\nanswers to these questions. At the hearing, Applicant explained that he knew he had\nold debts. He fluctuated on whether to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to the questions about his\ndebts because he knew if he left something out, he would have a problem or if he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d he would have a problem. Since his current bills were paid, he denied\nhaving any bills currently 90 days delinquent. He denied having any unpaid judgments\nin the last seven years because he had paid the 1998 and 1999 judgments, forgot about\nthe judgment listed in SOR allegation 1.I, and believed he did not owe the judgment in\nSOR allegation 1.e. He acknowledges he had tax liens and could not provide a reason\nfor his \u201cno\u201d answer on Question 27c.10\nApplicant completed his security clearance application on-line at home starting in\nthe evening and finishing it the next day because the recruiter had requested that he\nsubmit it immediately. He did not obtain a copy of his credit report prior to completing\nhis security clearance application nor did he review any of his files while filing out the\nsecurity clearance application. His recruiter advised him that he could correct problems\nin his interview.11\nApplicant\u2019s team leader testified on his behalf. He has worked with Applicant for\nthe last two years and sees him everyday. He described his work ethic as very good as\nApplicant assumes duties no one else wants to do, provides excellent insight and\nsolutions to issues, and is reliable. His project manager had similar comments about\nApplicant\u2019s work ethic and skills.   \n12\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt when his business\noperations failed to generate sufficient revenue to pay expenses. He still has significant\nunpaid debts and has shown no willingness to quickly resolve these debts. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries began in 2000 and continue to the present. Since his financial\nproblems occurred over long period of time, this mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems occurred when the business markets changed and his business revenues\ndeclined. As a business owner, he properly used his own funds and borrowed money to\nassure that his employees were paid and pay his business expenses. He had no control\nover the business markets. I find this potentially mitigating condition is partially\napplicable in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received any financial\ncounseling, except a suggestion that he sell his house to help resolve his debt\nproblems, which he did. He still has significant unpaid debts and has not yet developed\n\n7\na strategy or payment plan to resolve these debts. Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where\nthe evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant paid the outstanding tax liens and mortgages with\nthe proceeds from the sale of his house. He, however, has not made any effort to\nresolve his remaining debts. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions are\npartially applicable.\nFinally, under AG \u00b6 20(e), Applicant could mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns by showing he had \u201ca reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue.\u201d Applicant denied owing any additional premiums to the insurance company\nidentified in SOR allegation 1.o because he has cancelled the insurance policy.\nSubsequent to the hearing, he dispute this debt and the debt has been removed from\nhis credit report. He challenged the validity of other debts, but did not provide\n\u201cdocumented proof\u201d that he disputed these debts. The mitigation condition applies to\nSOR allegation 1.o only.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct::\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nThe government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86\nwhen he answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 27c, 27d, 28a, and 28b about his financial\ndelinquencies, judgments, and tax liens. This information is material to the evaluation of\nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty. He denies,\nhowever, that he deliberately falsified his answer to these questions. When a\nfalsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.\nProof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n13\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s\n13\nomission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nApplicant admits that he considered answering \u201cyes\u201d to these questions because\nhe knew he had financial problems in the past. He worried that if he failed to provide all\nthe necessary information he may have a problem. Applicant has acknowledged that he\nchose to answer \u201cno\u201d, not \u201cyes\u201d, when he knew that he had financial problems with\nunpaid debts in the past and tax liens had been filed against his house. I find that\nApplicant intentionally falsified his answer to Questions 27c and 28a. He did not\nintentionally falsify his answer to Question 28b as he rationally thought the question\nmeant his current debts, which he had paid. Likewise, he did not intentionally falsify his\nanswer to Question 27d because the debts listed in SOR allegations 1.f and 1.h were\nmore than seven years old and Applicant forgot about the other judgments. I do not\naccept his statement that he could correct his SF-86 after submission as truthful and\naccurate. In light of my findings, none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nIn reaching a conclusion under the whole person concept, I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, Applicant and\nhis wife were operating two businesses. The second business did not develop as he\nhad anticipated. The expenses for operating the business exceeded the revenue\n\n9\nregularly. He used his personal income and bank loans to pay these expenses to the\ndetriment of his personal expenses.  He accumulated debt due to circumstances\nbeyond his control. His business is gone. He still has debt problems related to his\nbusiness. \nThe issue is not simply whether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial\ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant\nhas not acted with due diligence to resolve his remaining outstanding debts, despite\navailability of almost $3,000 a month after his expenses are paid.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to\nhonesty answer questions about his finances raises questions about his\ntrustworthiness. He has not demonstrated a rational reason for his decision to answer\n\u201cno\u201d to two financial questions on his security clearance application. His failure at his\nhearing to candidly explain why he provided a false SF-86 remains a security concern.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant mitigated the security concerns \nraised under Guideline C, Foreign Preference. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nOn July 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines K, M, E and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6; Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 21, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on September \n17, 2008. I was advised through Department Counsel that Applicant and his Counsel \nrequested the first available hearing date. I was available to hear the case on October 1, \n2008. With the concurrence of both Department Counsel and Applicant\u2019s Counsel, the \ncase was scheduled for October 21, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nSeptember 29, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled and with the \nconcurrence of both parties. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 51, which \nwere admitted without objections. The government also presented two witnesses. \nApplicant offered Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted without objections. An \nadditional exhibit was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I and included in the record. \nApplicant testified and two witnesses testified on his behalf. The hearing was completed \non October 22, 2008, and the record closed. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on October 30, 2008.1  \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 2.a, 3.a, 3.b, 4.a, and \n4.b and provided explanations. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 2.b, and 2.c \nand also provided explanations. His admissions to the allegations in the SOR are \nincorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old former Department of State employee. He served with \nthe State Department from 1973 to March 2005, retiring after approximately 32 years. \nHe was assigned to various postings around the world and received promotions to \nsome of the highest positions in the agency.

Some of these security \nviolations and infractions occurred while Applicant was working in U.S. embassies \noverseas.

I have referenced the first \nvolume using Tr. and the second volume as Tr.II.  \n \n2 Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \ntestified that his office in the United States was located on a secure floor. He testified \nthat it was determined that there was either no compromise of classified information or \nthe likelihood of compromise was minimal.3  \n \n \nSpecifically the records reflect from 1978 to 1979, Applicant had five security \ninfractions while stationed at an embassy overseas.4 Applicant was counseled after \neach incident. Applicant was transferred to a new overseas embassy and had two \nsecurity infractions one in 1982 and one in 1983.5 Five of the infractions from 1978 to \n1983 involved leaving both confidential and secret documents unsecured. Two of the \ninfractions involved leaving the safe that stored classified documents unsecured. \nApplicant acknowledged that after each infraction he was counseled and advised of his \nresponsibility to lock the safe and keep the classified documents secured.  \n \n \nFrom 1987 through 1990, Applicant committed eleven security infractions and \none security violation while stationed at another overseas embassy assignment. Nine \ninfractions were for leaving classified documents unsecured and two infractions were for \nleaving the safe that stored classified documents unsecured. Applicant\u2019s security \nviolation was for using an unclassified word processor for classified material. Applicant \nconcurred that he was counseled after each infraction and violation, but stated \u201cI would \nsay in a perfunctory manner\u2026\u201d6 He did not recall having individual security briefings as \na result of the number of security infractions and violations, but he did not exclude it.7  \n \n \nOn December 22, 1988, Applicant received a letter from a senior State \nDepartment official advising him of official disciplinary action against him for \u201clack of \neffective security practices which led to nine security violations.\u201d8 Applicant\u2019s response \nas noted in the letter and his testimony at the hearing explained that his supervisor at \nthe time was very difficult to work for; the bulk of the violations occurred during a period \nimmediately after he arrived at his assignment and before an inspection; he had a busy \noffice and there was a need to respond to issues on short notice and often after hours; \nand he was often the last to leave the office. He also noted as a factor in mitigation that \nthere was a great deal of tension and pressure that he felt due to the senior person for \nwhom he worked.9 Applicant\u2019s response also included that he had met with the security \n \n3 Tr.

The two infractions occurred on June 7, 1982; and June 15, 1983. \n \n6 Tr. II 96; GE 13.

Applicant was reminded in the official letter that \nhe was a role model to subordinates. In the official letter it also acknowledged that \nApplicant took his responsibilities seriously. This letter informed Applicant that he was \nsuspended from his duties without pay for 16 days. It also informed him that, although \nall of the security violations were valid, two of them were discounted, in order to reduce \nthe suspension from 36 days to 16 days, so it would not be a hardship on the office. He \nwas advised that future violations would not be discounted. Applicant was further \nadvised that a copy of the letter would be made a part of his official personnel file where \nit would remain for a period for two years.10  \n \n \nApplicant received a second official letter on May 21, 1990, in which he was \ninformed that he would be suspended from his duties for ten days without pay for his \n\u201clack of effective security practices which led to eight security violations.\u201d11 Applicant\u2019s \nresponse in mitigation prior to the suspension was that he had been \u201cinterrupted by an \nurgent phone call\u201d which he claimed minimized his full responsibility for the violation. He \nwas further advised that the letter would remain in his official personnel file for a period \nof two years.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged at his hearing that these letters constituted \u201cformal \ndisciplinary actions.\u201d He also agreed that being suspended without pay constituted \ndisciplinary action.12 After Applicant\u2019s two suspensions, he committed two more security \ninfractions after he returned to the United States.13  \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR Applicant commented that the State Department \ndetermined that none of the security violations resulted in \u201chaving compromised \nsecurity\u201d and that all of the violations occurred within a controlled area with 24-hour \nsecurity.14 He further stated in a sworn affidavit the following, \u201cI obtained security \nbriefings, letters of warning and reprimand.\u201d15 \n \n \nApplicant admitted that while he was assigned a high level position in the State \nDepartment and while serving overseas from January 2001 to July 2003, he misused a \nU.S. Government (USG) computer by accessing sexually explicit internet websites, by \nviewing and downloading sexually explicit images, and by allowing a guest of his to \n \n10 Tr.

He explained that he had been using his personal \ncomputer for both official and personal use when due to an electrical power surge his \npersonal computer was destroyed. A senior officer associated with the embassy \nprovided a statement that explained:  \n \n \n[Applicant] expressed concern about keeping up with personal and \ninformal correspondence and emails without that computer, not to mention \nbusiness related messages on off hours and the weekend. I mentioned to \n[Applicant] that he could use his USG computer to keep up with his \ncorrespondence and get access to the internet. I mentioned that was my \nunderstanding of the policy regarding USG computers in [government] \nresidences.16  \n \nApplicant testified that he used the USG for both routine official correspondence and \npersonal correspondence. Applicant provided a sworn affidavit that states: \n \n[Person A] said that I did not have to buy a new computer that the \n[government] would provide me with a computer for personal use and this \nwas done. I know that there is a regulation to not view pornographic \nmaterial on a government computer, but this was in my residence and for \nmy personal use only. I did do work on the computer as well because I \nwas dedicated to the mission, but nothing of a classified or sensitive \nnature. I would type speeches, press statements and use email. I do not \nknow if the computer was connected to the [government] intranet. I \naccessed the internet and did not have to switch between systems as I \nhave had to at other locations so I assume it was not. I saw the \nDepartment of State warning banner on the computer, but again I believed \nthat this computer was for my personal use.17  \n \n \nApplicant also stated that although he did view pornographic material he never \ndid so in the workplace where he knew it was a violation of regulation.18 \n \n \nA State Department memorandum regarding the investigation about the misuse \nof the USG by Applicant provided a summary of an interview of Applicant about the \nevent.19 It stated:  \n \n[Applicant] stated that he knowingly and deliberately viewed and accessed \nsexually explicit websites and downloaded sexually explicit images \u2026 on \nthe USG computer located at his [residence]. [Applicant] stated that he \n \n16 AE A. \n \n17 GE 2 page 18. \n \n18 GE 2 page 19. \n \n19 GE 16.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nknew that his actions were contrary to Department regulation, but \n\u2018rationalized it as okay because he was violating regulations at the \n[residence] and not at his office.\u201920  \n \nIn addition, the memorandum stated: [Applicant] acknowledged that he told [Person A] \nthat he accessed and viewed sexually explicit material on the USG computer located at \nthe [residence].21 The memorandum also stated that: \n \n[Person A] advised [Applicant] that the Admin section would install a USG \ncomputer at the residence for his use. [Applicant] could not recall if he \nreceived a briefing or signed a \u201cuser access agreement\u201d prior to \ninstallation of the computer at the [residence].22 \n \n \nApplicant stated he did not divulge this information when applying for a security \nclearance because he did not believe it involved a security violation and he believed he \nwas only required to divulge those issues related to security violations. He further stated \nhe was embarrassed by the event and was attempting to be discreet. Applicant \nacknowledged that in early 2004 he was suspended without pay for ten days for this \nviolation. He also acknowledged that this action constituted disciplinary action.23  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged a guest at his residence also accessed his computer to \nview sexually explicit material. He was aware his guest was using the computer, but did \nnot know until he asked him that he was also accessing pornographic material. When \nasked how soon he spoke with his guest after he became aware the Government had \ndiscovered his violation, Applicant stated: \u201cI really don\u2019t remember how soon it was.\u201d He \nthen was asked if it would have been immediately. He responded \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it \nwould have been immediately, but I really don\u2019t recall.\u201d24 \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, but explained he believed the \ncomputer was issued to him for her personal use. I find Applicant was aware he was \nusing a government computer to access inappropriate material, albeit at his residence. I \ndo not find his statement credible that he believed the computer was only for personal \nuse. It is clear from the earlier interviews with the investigators that he was aware he \nwas using a government computer for official and unofficial purposes and he was \nattempting to minimize his actions by stating he only viewed and downloaded material \nat his residence. \n \n \n20 GE 16 at 4 \n \n21 Id. \n \n22 Id. \n \n23 Tr.

Applicant was also a \nhigh ranking State Department employee at the time. After the military officer (Officer B) \nretired Applicant stayed in contact with him. Applicant stated in his sworn affidavit:  \n \nI was aware, through conversation with [Officer B] that [Officer B] was \nconsulting for [overseas command] and also for private companies (no \nspecifics recalled). I assumed that [Officer B] still maintained his security \nclearance if he was with [overseas command], but I did not check this.25 \n \n \nAppellant additionally stated the following in his sworn statement: \n \nIn February 05, [Officer B] emailed me and asked me if there was anything \nI could send him regarding [Country K]. [Officer B] was going to a \n[conference] and was going to talk about political issues regarding \n[Country K]. [Officer B] did not ask for anything in particular and did not \nask for anything classified. \n \nI had a summary of what the U.S. policy was on [Country K] and the \ndocument was classified Secret. The document was sent to me by the \nState Department, but I do not know who classified the document Secret. I \ndo not disagree with the classification and I have no authority to declassify \nmaterial. \n \nThe document was on my classified computer at my office in [City Q]. I \ntried to remove all of the classified marking on the document by \nhighlighting the classified markings and then deleting them. I tried to make \nsure that I had accomplished this on all of the pages, but I was not sure if I \nwas successful. I intentionally tried to cover up that the document was \nclassified. I was trying to save time and effort on my part. I knew that what \nI was doing was wrong and a grave mistake. \n \nI downloaded the document to a disc and then uploaded it to my \nunclassified computer, also in my office. I did this on my own and with no \nhelp or assistance from anyone. It was on my classified computer that I \nremoved the classification markings before downloading and emailing the \ndocument to [Officer B] on my unclassified computer. Within the body of \nthe email to [Officer B] I had stated something to the effect of not sharing \nthis with anyone or acknowledge having seen it. I did this i[n] an attempt to \nlet [Officer B] know that the information was classified, without actually \nsaying that.  \n \nI do not know what [Officer B] did with the email, but after the investigation \nwas completed and we had met for dinner, I believe that he told me that \n \n25 GE 2 page 29. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nhe destroyed it. We never discussed the content of the email or whether \nthe document was classified or not. I do not recall what happened to the \ndisc that the document was placed on. I gave all discs to my assistant [Ms. \nN] and I do not know what she did with them.  \n \nI realize that the release of this document to the wrong people could \nnegatively affect U.S. security interests because it contained U.S. strategy \nand classified information on [Country K] and their future. I was not \nthinking of that and in trying to be expiedant (sic) I just emailed the \ndocument to [Officer B].26 \n \nApplicant went on to say: \u201cDue to the above, my SCI clearance was pulled in Mar/Apr \n05 and subsequently terminated.\u201d27 In addition he stated: \u201cI feel that I am aware of what \nis on my desk and have tasked my U.S. assistants with being vigilant with security and \nwatching out for security issues. I take security seriously and watch for security \nconcerns with the help of my assistants.\u201d28 \n \n \nAt his hearing Applicant testified that he provided the information to [Officer B] \nbecause of the following reasons: \u201c[Officer B] asked me for information. Secondly, he \nwas a friend. Thirdly, I knew he was, because he told me, that he was consulting for \n[command] and therefore had to have a security clearance.\u201d29 He also knew [Officer B] \nwould be attending a specific conference related to the information.30 Applicant \nconfirmed that the document he provided was a discussion paper from the State \nDepartment prepared for the \u201cPrinciples Committee\u201d and had been approved by the \nDeputy\u2019s Committee.31 Applicant recollected that the document was classified as \n\u201cSECRET/NO FORN.\u201d (Meaning no foreign personnel are authorized access to the \ndocument). These markings were the ones Applicant removed or attempted to remove. \nApplicant affirmed that this document is disseminated to the secretaries of various \ndepartments or the head of federal agencies. It is the type of document that is \nauthoritative on the U.S. position of current events in the specific country, a \u201csuggested \nway forward,\u201d \u201cnext step in key elements and assumptions,\u201d engagement strategy\u201d and \n\u201can annex with a time line.\u201d 32 Applicant reiterated in his testimony that \u201cI made the error \nof deciding to send that document to [Officer B], even though I knew that it had \n \n26 GE 2 at 29-30. \n \n27 Id. \n \n28 Tr.

He did this because he did not want to cause Officer B a \nproblem. His purpose was to help Officer B to help promote the U.S. interests.34 \n \n \nOfficer B testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. After he retired from the military he \nstayed in contact with Applicant. Applicant had dinner with Officer B and his wife at their \nhome and they also emailed each other. He considered Applicant a critical advisor \nwhen he was on active duty. Subsequent to his retirement, Officer B was to be a \nspeaker at a conference and he admitted he asked Applicant if he could provide him \nwith an update on Country K. He sent him an email and he received a response with an \nattachment to the email. The attachment showed a classification marking as \u201cSecret.\u201d \nOfficer B stated he thought the document was misclassified or was going to be \ndeclassified.35 He verified that there were foreign nationals in attendance at the \nconference who did not have a security clearance.36  \n \n \nOfficer B confirmed that GE 18 was a copy of the email that was sent from \nApplicant to Officer B and Officer B\u2019s response. In Applicant\u2019s email he stated: \u201cPLEASE \ndo not share this with anyone or acknowledge having seen it.\u201d Officer B\u2019s response to \nthe email was: \u201cThanks for the info.\u201d Officer B denied remembering the specifics of the \ndocument. He stated when he made the request to Applicant he did not request \nclassified material and Applicant did not tell him he was sending a classified document. \nOfficer B acknowledged that when he received the document he held a security \nclearance. He also acknowledged he received the classified document on his \nunclassified computer. He did not report that he received a classified document on his \nunclassified computer because he thought the document was unclassified and someone \nforgot to take the markings off of the document. He did not think to make such a report. \nHe stated he assumed Applicant would not send a classified document. He also stated \nthat it did not strike him as odd or unusual that Applicant specifically asked him not to \nshare the document with anyone or acknowledge having seen it. Officer B \nacknowledged that he was never asked by Applicant if he still held a security clearance. \nOfficer B was going to see Applicant at the conference the next day. He never asked \nApplicant about the classification of the document while at the conference. He stated he \nsaw no need to verify the classification of the document until he was notified several \nweeks later that the matter was being investigated.37  \n \n33 Tr. II 32.  \n \n34 Tr. II 33, 106-109. \n \n35 Tr. 304-307. Officer B provided his personal assessment of the importance of the information \ncontained in the classified document. His personal assessment, although admissible, is mainly relevant \nas to the extent of potential damage to national security.  \n \n36 Tr. 321-322. \n \n37 Tr. 304-310. Officer B\u2019s computer was seized and searched by forensic investigators. He \nsubsequently was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nOfficer B has continued his association with Applicant and considers him a good \nfriend. His opinion regarding his honesty, trustworthiness and ability to tell the truth is \n\u201cextremely positive\u201d. He felt honored that Applicant accepted the position at the \ncommand when he was in charge. He and Applicant worked closely for more than a \nyear on high level and sensitive negotiations and his opinion regarding Applicant\u2019s \nability to safeguard classified material was that he was \u201cvery mindful\u201d and made sure \nthat all classified material was handled appropriately. He believes Applicant was \nproperly trained and aware of the rules regarding security.38 \n \n \nApplicant stated when he lost his access to SCI he did not appeal the decision \nbecause he was advised by the central adjudication facility that it would have no bearing \non his security clearance status. Applicant felt he did not need access to SCI.39  \n \n \nApplicant applied for and obtained recognition as a citizen of the Republic of \nIreland. He admitted he applied for an Irish passport in 1991 and possessed it until \nrelinquishing it before his hearing due to the security clearance implications.40 He \nsought recognition as an Irish citizen because of his Irish heritage and because two of \nhis grandparents were born in Ireland. He became an Irish citizen for sentimental \nreasons. He also had in the back of his mind that he might buy property in Ireland one \nday and perhaps live there part of the year. He thought it might be useful to have Irish \ncitizenship and an Irish passport. In the past he has visited Ireland annually, but used \nhis U.S. passport. He has never traveled using his Irish passport. He admitted that he \ndid not advise the State Department at the time he was recognized as a dual citizen. He \ndid not recall if he had told his supervisor at the time that he was applying for \nrecognition as an Irish citizen. When questioned if he had informed any official in the \nState Department he stated: \u201cNot in a proactive way. I would have informed them on the \nnext security update or any, for example [official governmental] forum, which came \ndown the road about five years later for the position in [Country M].\u201d41 Applicant \nprovided a \u201cdeclaration of alienage\u201d to relinquish his Irish citizenship.42 His Irish \ncitizenship was terminated on October 15, 2008. Copies of his current and expired Irish \npassports were provided.43 Applicant testified he surrendered his Irish passport to the \nIrish authorities, but did not provide documentation of his surrender or verification of \nsuch.44 \n \n38 Tr. 310-313, 324, 336-338. \n \n39 Tr.II 36. \n \n40 Answer to SOR. \n \n41 Tr.II 86-89, 93-94. \n \n42 AE D.

Other than Applicant\u2019s testimony there is no other proof that he \nsurrendered his Irish passport.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nThe following are the findings of facts for the allegations for which \nApplicant has denied: \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed as part of a security clearance update in his office on \nJune 7, 2006, by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The \ninvestigator credibly testified that she uses a list of questions directly from the \ninvestigator\u2019s handbook and other questions she developed when questioning people. \nShe uses these questions in all of her cases. She took very detailed notes during the \ninterview with Applicant and later used her notes to write a summary of the interview. \nWith regards to all pertinent information she would always make sure she wrote the \ninformation down in her notes. Prior to the interview the investigator administered to \nApplicant an oath which required him to tell the truth and cited the pertinent criminal \ncode citation for violating the oath.45 The investigator confirmed that GE 3 was an \naccurate summary of her interview with Applicant.46  \n \n \nThe investigator credibly testified that she asks a series of standard questions \nregarding every employment entry on the security clearance application (SCA).47 One \nof the questions is: \u201cHave you ever committed any security violations or had any \ndisciplinary action taken against you?\u201d When Applicant was asked this question he \nindicated \u201che had not.\u201d When she asked if he had any disciplinary action, he indicated \n\u201che had not.\u201d Later during the interview the investigator, as part of her regular \nprocedure, goes over the SCA and re-asks the questions in the document to make sure \nthat the answers have not changed since the date the SCA was completed. She also \nasks supplemental questions that are required by OPM for each question. She asked \nApplicant whether he had been investigated by the U.S. government for any reason. \nApplicant indicated he was currently under investigation by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI). He indicated to the investigator that on the advice of his attorney he \ndid not want to provide any information about the case. He intimated it was an \ninvestigation related to a security issue. Applicant also noted that there was a second \ninvestigation associated with his present command. He declined to comment on that \ncase also on the advice of his attorney.48  \n \n \nBased on being informed of the two pending investigations the investigator \ntestified as follows:  \n \n \nSince it was in direct contradiction to his earlier statements about security \nviolations and his employment, I asked if there w[ere] any other security \n \n \n45 The investigator cited 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1001. \n \n46 Tr. 42-50. \n \n47 Tr. 52-53. The other questions the interviewer asked were: Have you ever had any problems \nwith your supervisor or coworkers? Have you ever had a negative performance review?  Have you ever \ncommitted any security violations or had any disciplinary action taken against you? \n  \n48 Tr. 52-57. \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                          \nviolations that he had not indicated. And he indicated there were a few \nminor ones when he was employed with the State Department and located \n[in various overseas locations], I believe. And he stated those were minor \nsecurity violations that did not result in any compromise of any sensitive \ninformation. And he provided that those were mostly instances of him \nleaving documents on his desk in a secure location and that the Marine \nsecurity guards, the MSGs49 at the [places] would do sweeps for classified \ninformation and if they found it on his desk, they would report it to their \nsupervisor.50  \n \nThe investigator testified when a subject indicates he had a security violation she asks, \nas part of her regular procedure, for the details, including the dates, if there was a \ncompromise, and if there was any disciplinary action. She asked Applicant those \nquestions. She testified: \n \nWell, he provided as much information as he could recall. He couldn\u2019t \nrecall specific dates. He did provide the type of violation as I described \nand that there was no compromise [of] sensitive information. And when I \nasked about disciplinary actions, he said that he could not recall any \ndisciplinary actions being taken against him regarding those security \nviolations.51 \n \nThe investigator then proceeded to ask standard wrap-up questions. She would ask one \ngeneral question as it is stated on the SCA. She stated she asked \u201cif there is any \ninformation that they think would be pertinent to our case that we haven\u2019t gone over that \nthey would like to disclose to the government at this time.\u201d Applicant indicated he had \nno further information.52 \n \n \nThe investigator confirmed that during her interview with Applicant she \nquestioned him twice about disciplinary actions. Asking him, \u201cOnce for every \nemployment and then again after he gave me the information about the investigations \non him.\u201d His response was the first time that he did not have any disciplinary actions \nand at the end when we were discussing the earlier security violations he indicated he \n\u201ccould not recall any disciplinary actions.\u201d53 When questioned further about the FBI and \ncommand investigation, he did not indicate any other investigations he had been \n \n49 MSG are the initials for \u201cMarine Security Guard.\u201d \n \n50 Tr. 57-58. \n \n51 Tr. 58. \n \n52 Tr. 59. \n \n53 Tr. 60. \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n                                                          \ninvolved in.54 He did not divulge the investigation regarding his misuse of a government-\nissued computer and the disciplinary action taken.55 \n \n \nAs part of the investigator\u2019s follow-up investigation, she was provided access to \nApplicant\u2019s State Department file and discovered he had security violations that led to \ndisciplinary actions and an investigation regarding his misuse of a government-issued \ncomputer.56 \n \n \nThe investigator acknowledged that she had advised Applicant that her interview \nwas for a periodic update to his security clearance.57 Applicant testified he believed the \nupdate covered the past five years.58 The investigator confirmed that the specific \nquestions she asked Applicant were \u201c[D]id you receive any disciplinary actions while \nyou were with said employer, the State Department? And did you commit any security \nviolations while you were with the State Department?\u201d59 Applicant readily acknowledged \nthe two pending investigations with the FBI and the command.60 \n \n \nThe background investigation conducted on Applicant was his first Department of \nDefense investigation. The investigator acknowledged that Applicant should refer back \nten years. She acknowledged that often times she would not have access to State \nDepartment or FBI records of investigation, so she would go back ten years. The \ninvestigator credibly testified she questioned Applicant about any past disciplinary \naction he may have received. She stated, \u201cThere was no time limit on that because we \ncover the entire span on someone\u2019s employment when it is a single employment. I said \ndid you ever have any disciplinary actions, security violations, negative performance \nappraisals, etc. . . .\u201d She could not remember specifically if she used the word \u201cever\u201d but \nshe was certain that she used the word \u201cany.\u201d61 \n \n \nThe investigator confirmed that Applicant never admitted during his interview that \nhe was disciplined for security violations and he also never divulged his more recent \ndisciplinary action for misuse of a government-issued computer.62 She confirmed that \nshe asked a general question to the effect of while you were employed at the State \n \n54 Tr. 61. \n \n55 Id. \n \n56 Tr. 61-62. \n \n57 Tr. 65. \n \n58 Tr.

He testified his main concern was how to \naddress the two on-going investigations. He remembered that part of the interview, but \nwith regard to his overall recollection he stated \u201cTo the best of my recollection I want to \nemphasize again that my recollection is very fuzzy about that entire interview.\u201d65 He \nconfirmed he did not have a clear memory of the questions and answers during the \ninterview about his security violations with the State Department. He did not take notes \non the interview. He did not recall denying that he had security violations. He did not \nhave any specific recollection about the investigator asking him about any disciplinary \nactions. He stated:  \n \nI may have misunderstood her question. Perhaps it was not posed \nprecisely as she said it was in her notes. I don\u2019t know. Could have \ndiscussed the fact that I have not suffered adverse consequences in my \ncareer, heretofore as a result of these security violations and the \nreprimands and suspensions.66 \n \nHe went on to say:  \n \n \nSo from my point of view, I didn\u2019t suffer adverse consequences as a result \nof this record and I may, given what her testimony, that may have been \nwhat I was responding. But I do not have specific recollection of any part \nof the interview other than the two investigations that I had focused on and \nthat I had thought in advance about how I would address those in the \ndiscussion with her.67  \n \nApplicant could not \u201crecall\u201d or \u201crecollect\u201d most of the specifics of his interview with the \ninvestigator. He said he does not have any reason to dispute her testimony or agree \nwith it.68 However, he did remember that he did not divulge his investigation about \n \n63 Tr. 87-92. \n \n64 Tr. 42-100. The transcript at these pages records the entire testimony of the OPM Investigator. \nRepeatedly throughout her testimony she confirmed that she requested but Applicant did not divulge that \nhe had prior disciplinary actions by his previous employer, the State Department. He did not divulge the \ninvestigation regarding his misuse of a government-issued computer. She was asked many questions in \ndifferent forms and different ways and her answers remained consistent. \n \n65 Tr. II 124. \n \n66 Tr. II 20-28. \n \n67 Id. \n \n68 Tr. II 123. \n\n \n15 \n \n \n                                                          \nmisuse of a government-issued computer because it was in his view not a security \nmatter.69 He stated:  \n \nWell I may have been in error in not considering the misuse of the \ncomputer in the way I did misuse it as relating to security, but that was my \nview at the time. Now that I\u2019ve been in this procedure and I\u2019ve seen all the \ndifferent criteria that are being applied in the case in DOD documents, I \nunderstand the relevance of it. This was not my situation when I was \ninterviewed by [investigator]. I didn\u2019t know about these criteria, my \njudgment was that this was not a security related matter and that I did not \nneed to disclose it.70  \n \nIn response to a question whether the interviewer said anything to lead him to believe \nthat she was only focused on security matters, he responded:  \n \nI don\u2019t have a clear enough recollection of the exchanges between the two \nof us to assert that. But it was a security update, she was an investigator \nfor my security clearance, I did not think that that misuse of the computer \nis relevant. I now know there are criteria which make it relevant, I did not \nrealize that at the time.71  \n \nApplicant then testified that when he was asked a general question about whether there \nwas anything else that was relevant concerning his security clearance, he did recall this \npart of the interview, but did remember that he volunteered the information about the \ntwo ongoing investigations by the FBI and other local command investigation.72 \nApplicant could not recall if he advised the investigator about his disciplinary \nsuspensions or the letters of reprimand he received.73  \n \n \nApplicant was asked the following question by his attorney and his response is \nprovided: \n \n \nQ. Did you know when you were interviewed by [OPM Investigator] \nin June of 2006 that she would find out about [country] or the [country] \ncomputer incident if she looked at your State Department files? \n \n \nA. I wasn\u2019t sure because these were personnel files and not \nsecurity files. So I didn\u2019t know that\u2013whether she would have access to \npersonnel files. Certainly, she would have access to the files contained\u2014\n \n69 Tr. II 126. \n \n70 Tr. II 127-128. \n \n71 Tr. II 129. \n \n72 Id. \n \n73 Tr.

But, diplomatic security was not part of the process on the \nmisuse of the computer, it was a panel composed just of personnel and \nlegal.74 \n \n \nI find Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible or believable. Applicant clearly had \nselective memory and his responses were evasive. I find Applicant intentionally failed to \nfully divulge his past security violations, disciplinary actions, and investigations. \n \n \nWhile serving in a high level position overseas Applicant had a foreign national \n(FN D) who worked for him. While working for Applicant FN D held a security clearance, \ngranted through his country. Applicant had both a professional and personal relationship \nwith FN D and considered him to be a subject matter expert in an important area of \ninternational significance and a valuable employee. Applicant was advised in June 2005 \nby higher authority that FN D\u2019s security clearance was revoked by his country. Applicant \nwas told by FN D that the revocation was due to a technical issue and would be \nresolved. When FN D\u2019s security clearance was revoked it also revoked his employment \ncontract because his position required a security clearance. Applicant was aware once \na security clearance is revoked a person is not to have access to classified information. \nApplicant denied knowing FN D had access to classified material.75  \n \n \nApplicant personally advocated and requested that FN D be rehired, but with a \ncontract that did not require access to classified information. He testified that his goal \nwas to rehire FN D because he believed FN D would be vindicated and then could \nresume the position he had previously held.76 He further testified that he personally told \nFN D that his contract work was only to involve unclassified material. He stated he \ncommunicated this to the Chief of Staff of the command (COS-M) and to his personal \nChief of Staff (COS). Not having a security clearance meant that FN D did not have \nunescorted access to the building where he previously worked. This was the same \nbuilding where Applicant and his staff worked. Applicant denied any responsibility for \nensuring FN D did not have access to classified material beyond advising and \ndelegating this responsibility to his COS to ensure FN D did not have access.77 He \nstated: \u201cI never had concerns that he was getting into classified areas. And I\u2019ve testified \n \n74 Tr. II 185-186. \n \n75 Tr. II 135-140. The counterintelligence officer who testified verified that once a security \nclearance is revoked by the person\u2019s country, there is no middle ground. The requirement is that upon a \nsuspension, termination, or revocation, the individual\u2019s employment must be immediately terminated. He \nemphasized that once a country withdraws a clearance, it is \u201cpretty sacrosanct,\u201d and we must \u201cax them.\u201d \n\u201cThere is no middle ground, no wiggle room.\u201d The command has no right to request the reason for the \nrevocation as it is a sovereign issue. Tr. 190-196. \n \n76 Tr. II 149-151, 154. \n \n77 Tr. II 153. \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \n                                                          \nto that fact and I\u2019ve sworn and affirmed it over and over again. I was not aware he was \ngetting into classified material.\u201d78  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s COS raised his personal concerns with Applicant about the \narrangements for FN D to remain in the same office he had occupied prior to losing his \nsecurity clearance and his job. He also was concerned that FN D was attending weekly \nstaff meetings. Applicant acknowledged that the COS raised the concerns, but believed \nit was only once or twice, instead of the numerous times that the COS claimed he raised \nthe issues. Applicant confirmed that the COS did not think it was right for FN D to be \nworking on the contract because his security clearance had been revoked. He stated \nthe staff meetings were not classified. Applicant testified he believed FN D was working \non an unclassified project and he believed FN D would be vindicated and his clearance \nreinstated. He acknowledged he did not personally inform his staff that FN D\u2019s security \nclearance had been revoked; rather he relied on his COS to ensure compliance with his \ndirections. He also acknowledged that no announcement went out telling others in the \ncommand that FN D no longer had a security clearance, even though he was working in \nthe same building, in the same office, and for the same people. Applicant was unaware \nof any efforts made to make an announcement and he did not personally do so. When \nFN D came to his private office he did not verify if he was being escorted. 79  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he was attempting to establish a temporary position and \na permanent position for FN D. He was working with the personnel office to write up a \nposition description and the required qualifications. FN D was contacting the personnel \noffice and advising them what the qualifications should be to hold the position. This \nposition was to be advertised so others could compete to be hired. In effect, FN D was \nproviding input on a position he was going to apply for. Applicant sat on the selection \nboard for the position. Regarding a certain person who applied for this position, \nApplicant stated that FN D \u201cmay have\u201d provided me input on this particular applicant \nbased on the applicant\u2019s paperwork, but he was not part of the interview process. This \nperson was not selected. Applicant confirmed that FN D had input into writing the \nposition description and it was designed for him to get the job. Applicant believed as \nlong as the description and qualifications were valid for the position it was okay. \nApplicant did not believe these actions were subverting the system or that it was \nimproper for FN D to be involved.80  \n \n \nFN D continued to occupy the same office he had prior to the revocation of his \nsecurity clearance. He continued to attend some classified briefings and meetings \n \n78 Tr. II 153. \n \n79 Tr. II 149-157. \n \n80 Tr. II 163-168. The compliance and violation of personnel and administrative rules are not at \nissue in this case and are not considered for disqualifying purposes. The facts related to this area, \nhowever, will be considered when analyzing the whole person and credibility issues. GE 48 indicates a \nlengthy email correspondence on the efforts by the Applicant and those acting on his behalf to retain FN \nD as a full time employee.  \n \n\n \n18 \n \n \n                                                          \nbecause those in attendance had not been advised that his security clearance was \nrevoked. He produced weekly summaries on his particular area of expertise sponsored \nby Applicant\u2019s office that included sensitive, restricted, confidential or classified \ninformation and listed himself as the author on the weekly summaries.81 Applicant \nconfirmed if he was in the office he would approve the weekly summaries before they \nwere published. If he was not available the COS would handle it. He stated \u201cI didn\u2019t pay \nattention to the classification markings on each of the individual paragraphs. I reviewed \nthose documents for substance, not for format, not for classification. That was COS\u2019 \nresponsibility.\u201d82 In addition, point papers were prepared by FN D that noted the \nclassification as \u201crestricted\u201d material. On the point papers FN D included his title, which \nwas the same title he held prior to having his contract terminated and his clearance \nrevoked.83  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he \u201cmisplaced\u201d his trust in FN D. He stated:  \n \n \nAnd had I realized the extent to which he was prepared to violate the \nrules, I would never even have contemplated allowing him to stay, but I \nhad no reason to believe that and I had faith and confidence in him and it \nturns out to have been mistrusted, or misplaced, I beg your pardon, And I \nregret that very much, Yes, in retrospect, my supervision should have \nbeen more careful in this regard and I wish that I had been more careful to \nhave avoided these problems.84  \n \nApplicant denied he condoned or permitted access to classified material to FN D. \nApplicant believed he fulfilled his security obligations by delegating them to his COS.85 \n \n \nA high level inquiry was conducted concerning FN D\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. The inquiry was completed by two senior personnel security and \ncounterintelligence officers.86 Some of the findings of the inquiry are as follows:87 \n \n81 AE 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, and 36. \n \n82 Tr. II 140. \n \n83 AE 37-40. \n \n84 Tr. II 183. \n \n85 Tr. II 184. \n \n86 It is noted that the counterintelligence officer who was one of the two who prepared the report \ntestified to its accuracy. The original report, which was classified, was signed by him. The difference \nbetween the classified and unclassified reports is that the classified version uses the actual names of the \nindividuals and was signed. This witness testified that he specifically used the term \u201cinquiry\u201d vice \n\u201cinvestigation\u201d due to the sensitive political and international ramifications of the issues. I have not \nincluded all of the findings of the report, although they are included in GE 20. I have only included those \nthat specifically pertain to the issues of this case and Applicant. I have also made independent findings of \nfacts from the testimony of the witnesses, Applicant, and all of the other evidence presented and \nconsidered all of it. The witness provided a lengthy explanation as to how the inquiry was conducted, \n\n \n19 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\u2022 \u201cIn June 2005, Subsequent to [Security Office] notification of [command] that FN \nD\u2019s security clearance had been revoked, [command] took appropriate steps to \nterminate FN D\u2019s access to \u2026classified information and FN D\u2019s employment \n(E.g. FN D\u2019s \u2026access was terminated and FN D\u2019s Class II security area building \naccess pass was confiscated.) \n\u2022 \u201cCirca August/September 2005, at the behest of the [Applicant], FN D was \nreturned to employment at [command] as an \u2018unclassified consultant.\u2019\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cHowever, FN D was effectively returned to the same duty position within the \nsame office of a Class II secure area.\u201d \n\u2022  \u201cNo one outside of the Command Group and FN D\u2019s direct co-workers was \ninformed of the fact that FN D had no security clearance.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cAs a result, FN D continued to be the recipient of . . . classified information. The \ninformation ranged from \u2026RESTRICTED to . . .SECRET, and was provided to \n[different commands and headquarters].\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cApproximately one linear meter of \u2026classified documents was discovered in FN \nD\u2019s office. The majority of these documents were originated prior to the \nrevocation of FN D\u2019s security clearance. However, upwards of 20-25% of the \ndocuments were originated subsequently to the revocation of FN D\u2019s security \nclearance.\u201d88 \n\u2022 \u201cAlthough the [Applicant] instructed [COS] to ensure that FN D had no access to \nclassified information, this was done to present the illusion of compliance with \n\u2026security relations.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201c[COS] indicated that the [Applicant] was knowledgeable that [FN D] continued to \nhave access to classified information, and in some cases authorized such \naccess.\u201d  \n\u2022 \u201cIn fact, [FN D] continued to produce classified materials, to include the \u2026Weekly \nSummary, at the \u2026Restricted and \u2026Confidential level and they were distributed \nto the [Applicant]. These documents were clearly marked with classification \nmarkings and indicated [FN D] as the author. The \u2026Weekly Summary was \ndisseminated to the [Applicant] and the Command Group,89 as well as places on \nthe \u2026 classified LAN.\u201d   \n\u2022 \u201cFN D\u2019s continued physical presence in a Class II security area90 without a valid \nsecurity clearance constituted a violation of \u2026Security Regulations. Additionally, \n \nincluding interviewing between 50-60 people, searching and seizing documents from FN D\u2019s office, \nviewing computer hard drives, etc. Tr. 199-202.  \n \n87 Tr. 205-207. The witness also verified that GE 21 and 22 are the security regulations that were \napplicable during the time of the inquiry.  \n \n88 This information was confirmed by the counterintelligence officer at the hearing. Tr. 202-203. \nSome of the documents seized are GE 30-40. The classified information that appeared in the document \nhas been redacted.  \n \n89 Tr. 142-143. The Command Group is made up of the highest ranking officers in the command. \n \n90 Tr. 143. A Class II secured area requires personnel to have a security clearance or be escorted \nat all times.  \n\n \n20 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nno effort was made to remove [FN D\u2019s] previous classified holdings from [his] \noffice prior to [his] reoccupancy of this work space.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201c\u2026 classified documents at the \u2026RESTRICTED91 and \u2026CONFIDENTIAL [level] \nwere produced on an Unclassified Internet enabled computer by [FN D].\u201d \n\u2022 \u201c[FN D] also continued to attend \u2026 classified meetings and conferences albeit \nwithout the knowledge of the chairs of these fora that [FN D] had no security \nclearance.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cA number of [FN D\u2019s] co-workers admitted to providing [FN D] classified \ninformation with at least some level of knowledge that [FN D] had no security \nclearance. However, the general claim of his co-workers was that they were \nnever informed that [FN D\u2019s] security clearance was removed, but rather that \nthere had been an administrative error with [his] security clearance that would be \ncorrected shortly.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201c[COS] admitted that [he] had been informed that [FN D\u2019s] security clearance had \nbeen removed, but also stated that the [Applicant] indicated that this was an \nadministrative oversight on the part of the \u2026authorities. As such, the [Applicant] \nindicated to [COS] that [FN D] should continue to have access to relevant \nclassified information necessary for [FN D] to work on [subject operation] and \n[subject project]. [COS] indicated that as time progressed, both the staff of \n[Applicant\u2019s] office and [COS] became increasingly uncomfortable about [FN D\u2019s] \nlack of security clearance. As such, [COS] claimed to have discussed this issue \nwith [Applicant] on a number of occasions. When the [Applicant] did not react, \n[COS] informed [COS-M] in January or February 2006.\u201d92 \n\u2022 \u201cInterviews of numerous individuals found that most were unknowledgeable of \n[FN D\u2019s] security clearance status, and as a result, were unable to precisely \nindicate what specific classified information was provided to [FN D].\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cHowever, the inquiry determined that [FN D] was involved in a diverse range of \nclassified areas. For example, [FN D] was involved with \u2026.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cNumerous individual\u2019s claimed to have raised their concerns about [FN D\u2019s] \naccess to classified information with the [Applicant]\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cOn 9 March 2006, [FN D] telephoned investigators and requested to meet with \ninvestigators.\u201d (Additional information is contained in the report that is not \nspecifically pertinent.) \n\u2022 \u201c[FN D] stated from June 2005 until February 2006, that [he] worked as an \nunclassified consultant with no access to classified information. When asked \nabout classified documents in [his] office, [FN D] could offer no explanation. \nWhen asked about receipt of classified information subsequent to the revocation \nof [his] security clearance, [FN D] could offer no explanation.\u201d \n \n \n91 Tr. 212-213. \u201cRestricted\u201d by definition from the Treaty is a security classification and is \nconsidered classified information.  \n \n92 Tr. 125-126. COS-M testified that he recalled that COS came to his office to discuss FN D. He \nstated he did not remember the specifics of the conversation, but believed it had to do with what level of \naccess FN D should have. He stated his direction was that FN D should have unclassified access and \nhave escorted access to the building. \n\n \n21 \n \n \nAn additional note was made in the report that stated the following: \u201cHistorically, both \n[COS-M] and [Applicant] routinely made extraordinary efforts for FN D.\u201d Examples of \nsuch are in included in the report.93  \n \nThe conclusions of the inquiry are as follows: \n \n\u2022 \u201c[Command] created conditions that resulted in a major compromise of ... \nclassified information to FN D.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cActions on the part of [COS-M], and the [Applicant], U.S. national, to \naccommodate the continued employment of [FN D], following the revocation of \nhis national security clearance, violated the intent of both the \u2026Security and \nCivilian Personnel Regulation, and were the direct cause of [FN D\u2019s] continued \nand routine access to \u2026 classified information.\u201d \n\u2022  \u201cThe manner in which [FN D] was subsequently employed constituted a direct \nand deliberate violation of \u2026 Security Regulations.\u201d  \n\u2022 \u201c[COS] allowed [FN D] continued access to \u2026classified information with the \nknowledge that [FN D] had no security clearance. However, [COS] did so with \nthe informed consent and under the implied direction of [Applicant].\u201d94 \n\u2022 \u201c[Applicant] was undoubtedly aware of [FN D\u2019s] continued access to classified \ninformation without a security clearance, although [Applicant] denied any such \nknowledge.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cThe actions on the part of the [Applicant] placed the subordinate members of his \noffice at serious risk of violating national espionage statutes involving the \nmishandling of classified information.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cThe full extent of the magnitude of the compromise is impossible to determine \nand, as such, a damage assessment cannot be conducted.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cLastly, although not a part of the \u2026inquiry, \u201c[COS-M]\u201d and [Applicant\u2019s] actions \nrelative to FN D were part of a clear and continuing pattern to violate \u2026rules on \nFN D\u2019s behalf; to include violation of \u2026Civilian Personnel Regulations, \u2026Security \nRegulations, \u2026 Financial Regulations and possibly \u2026 Contracting Regulations. \n                                                          \n93 Testimony by the counterintelligence officer confirming his findings in the inquiry are located at \nTr. 209-291. Additional findings are included in the report regarding the irregularities in the personnel \nhiring regulations. \n \n94 At the hearing the counterintelligence officer explained that this finding meant that COS had \ncomplained to Applicant as time progressed and that his staff was, in turn, complaining to COS and that \nthe implied direction is the instruction from Applicant to ensure FN D has everything he needs to do his \nwork on a specific operation. In addition, COS as well as others in Applicant\u2019s office were aware that FN \nD was attending classified meetings and this was allegedly conveyed to Applicant. It was confirmed that \nCOS had a responsibility to ensure FN D was restricted to only unclassified information and that he be \nrestricted while in the building. The counterintelligence officer\u2019s report confirmed COS permitted FN D \naccess to classified information and the COS\u2019 contention was he was acting on the implied consent of \nCOS M and Applicant. Tr. 254-258. \n \n\n \n22 \n \n \n                                                          \nAlso, the civilian recruitment process was corrupted in an extraordinary effort to \ncreate a civilian position that was solely designed to be occupied by FN D.\u201d95 \n \nThe final conclusion of the in-depth inquiry was as follows: \n \nThe final conclusion of the inquiry should indicate that [COS-M] and \n[Applicant] were responsible for creating the conditions that resulted in a \nmajor compromise.96 [COS], while not blameless, should not be singled \nout as the primary responsible party. \n \n \nThe counterintelligence officer who conducted the inquiry confirmed that FN D \nhad access to classified information after his clearance was revoked.97 He confirmed \nthat he met with the country representatives that had originally authorized a security \nclearance to FN D and they were outraged because they believed the [Command] was \nnon-responsive to their national decision and that both COS-M and Applicant had both \nprovided memorandums of support for FN D in his legal battle, which they viewed as an \ninterference in a national judicial matter.98 I find the counterintelligence officer\u2019s \ntestimony credible. \n \n \nApplicant denied he was aware of the situation or responsible as outlined \nabove.99 I find Applicant\u2019s testimony was evasive, not credible and not believable.100 \n \n95 GE 20. It is noted that some of the findings and conclusions of the inquiry are not considered \nfor disqualifying purposes, but are considered in the whole person analysis and to show the relationships \nbetween the different people, a pattern, credibility, and a course of conduct. Conduct not alleged in the \nSOR may be considered: \u201c(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence \nof extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). \n \n96 COS-M testified at the hearing. COS-M was asked if while attending a high level meeting \nwhether the command\u2019s legal advisor advised the Commander and others at the meeting that FN D\u2019s \ncontinued unescorted presence in [Class II secured spaces] was a violation of \u2026 security regulations. \nCOS-M\u2019s response was \u201cShe may have done but I cannot remember.\u201d Tr. 145. He also stated that he did \nnot read the weekly summaries thoroughly, but rather skimmed them and did not notice anything that FN \nD had written that may or may not have been classified. Tr. 146. \n \n97 TR. 196. \n \n98 Tr. 197-198. Although the issue of interference in a nation\u2019s sovereignty is not at issue in this \ncase, this information is relevant in analyzing the relationships and actions by Applicant during this time. \n \n99 COS-M was asked if during the time in question if he was \u201caware of any circumstances or any \nsituation where FN D accessed, or used, or discussed, or developed classified information.\u201d His answer \nwas \u201cI was not actually aware of that practice, no.\u201d Regarding whether he was aware if Applicant allowed \nor permitted the access of classified information by FN D, he answered \u201cno, I was not and I would have \nbeen highly surprised had I become aware of it.\u201d He was further asked if anyone complained to him about \nFN D accessing classified information or possessing classified information. He stated \u201cThere was one \noccasion, and I could not tell you when it was, COS did come up to my office and my aide opened the \ndoor and the three of us stood in my doorway and discussed it. And I reaffirmed the absolute intent, which \n\n \n23 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nApplicant submitted character statements from two high ranking supervisors. \nOne supervisor wrote that, despite the allegations in the SOR, they \u201cbear no \nresemblance\u201d to Applicant, with whom he worked closely with for two years. He \nconsiders Applicant honest, trustworthy and reliable, and never doubted his loyalty. He \nreferred to Applicant\u2019s constant exposure to highly classified documents and being \nentrusted with the most sensitive information during certain negotiations, and at no time \ndid he witness or hear that Applicant jeopardized that trust. He went on to say, \u201cI can \nstate unequivocally that he upheld the highest standards for handling classified material \nduring our service together\u201d.101 \n \n \nA second supervisor characterized Applicant as one of his most \u201cinvaluable \nadvisors.\u201d He was relied upon for his \u201cexpertise, his insightful analysis, and his sound \njudgment.\u201d He has his fullest faith, trust and confidence in his \u201cfidelity and loyalty to the \nUnited States of America, and I trust him to represent me personally before heads of \nstate.\u201d He confirmed that he is aware of the allegations against Applicant and believes \nthey are inconsistent with his character and do not cast doubt on his opinion of \nApplicant.102  \n \n \nCOS M testified Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the U.S. is absolute and faultless.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to cla\n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicated guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the nation interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d107 Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication Applicant has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify an Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Applicant applied for and obtained recognition of \ndual citizenship with Ireland while serving as a State Department employee. He retained \nan Irish passport from 1991 until 2008. I find both disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions applicable to this guideline. \nSpecifically I have considered AG \u00b6 11 (a) (\u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 \ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship\u201d) and (e) (\u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered \nto the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated\u201d). Applicant\u2019s dual \ncitizenship status is based on his affirmative actions to be recognized as a citizen of \nIreland. I find (a) does not apply. Applicant provided a document to support his \nrenunciation of his dual citizenship status with Ireland. He stated he was required to \nrelinquish his passport. He did not provide documentation to show that he actually did \nrelinquish it. However, under the circumstances I find it is likely he did relinquish it.115 \nTherefore, I find (b) and (e) apply. \n \n111 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n112 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \n \n113 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n114 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; See AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n115 It is troubling that Applicant applied for and retained dual citizenship while serving in high level \npositions in the State Department and did not advise or request permission from his superiors prior to \n\n \n26 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the security concern pertaining to handling protected \ninformation: \u201cDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an individual\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such \ninformation, and is a serious security concern.\u201d \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered (a) (\u201cdeliberate or negligent disclosure of \nclassified or other protected information to unauthorized persons, including but not \nlimited to personal or business contacts, to the media, or to persons present at \nseminars, meetings, or conferences\u201d); (c) (\u201cloading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, \ntransmitting, or otherwise handling classified reports, data, or other information on any \nunapproved equipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \ncomputer hardware, software, drive, system, gameboard, handheld, \u201cpalm\u201d or pocket \ndevice or other adjunct equipment\u201d); (e) (\u201ccopying classified or other protected \ninformation in a manner designed to conceal or remove classification or other \ndocuments control markings\u201d); (g) (\u201cany failure to comply with rules for the protection of \nclassified or other sensitive information\u201d); (h) (\u201cnegligence or lax security habits that \npersist despite counseling by management\u201d) and (i) (\u201cfailure to comply with rules or \nregulations that results in damage to the National Security, regardless of whether it was \ndeliberate or negligent\u201d). \n \n \nApplicant has a long documented history of security violations and infractions. \nHis irresponsible attitude toward protecting classified information existed from 1978 to \n1994. It then remained dormant for a period of years until it escalated to deliberately \ndisregarding security rules and regulations for protecting classified information. His \nattempt to minimize and mitigate his actions during the early period by explaining he \nwas working for a difficult supervisor, was under a great deal of stress, or had a busy \noffice and was interrupted by someone, is without merit. The repetitive security \ninfractions and violations denote a lack of regard for the importance of his duties with \nregard to protecting classified information. He was repeatedly counseled about his \nconduct after each infraction or violation and received not one, but two suspensions \nwithout pay for his actions. \n \nApplicant has held increasingly more responsible and prestigious jobs in the \nState Department. With those important promotions came a higher degree of trust, \nresponsibility and access to classified material and awareness of security rules. \nPerhaps his earlier infractions and violations could have been mitigated by time, but \ninstead Applicant escalated his irresponsible attitude and lack of adherence to the rules, \nby deliberately downloading a \u201cSECRET\u201d document from a classified computer, placing \nthe information on a disc and then removing the \u201cSECRET\u201d classification markings, and \nemailing it on an unclassified computer to Officer B, without first confirming if Officer B \n \nobtaining this status. He acknowledged it was likely that he provided information about his dual \ncitizenship years later when he provided this information during a routine update.  \n\n \n27 \n \n \nstill retained a security clearance. He does not know what happened to the disc on \nwhich the classified document was downloaded, as he gave it to his assistant. He \nacknowledged his wrongful actions. Applicant\u2019s access to SCI was denied due to \nsecurity concerns and security violations. It was also determined that the information \nwas to be used at a conference where foreign nationals were present. Applicant \nacknowledged that this document is the type that contained the \u201dU.S. position of current \nevents in the country\u201d, \u201ca suggested way forward\u201d, \u201cnext step in the key elements and \nassumptions\u201d, \u201cengagement strategy\u201d and an annex with a time line. \n \n \nApplicant was in a high level position of trust and responsibility during his last job \nwith the State Department and then when he became a contracted employee with the \nsame command. He was responsible for ensuring FN D did not have access to \nclassified information. His abdication of his ultimate responsibility to ensure FN D did \nnot have any access to classified information is confirmed. His denial that he did not \nknow FN D had access to classified information is not believable. The overwhelming \nevidence is that he was actively involved with FN D at many levels. He received weekly \nupdates from FN D that showed FN D had access to classified material. I find Applicant \nwas an active participant in the process that violated the security rules. I find Applicant \nwas personally, deliberately and intimately involved and aware that FN D had access to \nclassified information. I find Applicant knowingly and deliberately permitted FN D access \nto classified information. His testimony with regard to this issue was evasive and not \nbelievable. His attempt at passing all responsibility onto COS is also not believable. I \nalso find that, even if one were to believe the facts as presented by Applicant, he merely \ngave the order and then was totally unaware that FN D continued having access to \nclassified information. He never noticed weekly summaries or point papers to the \ncontrary, or never heard complaints from his subordinates. Even if viewed in the most \nfavorable position to Applicant, he did not act responsibly as FN D\u2019s supervisor to \nensure all classified material was protected. Even if Applicant were to be believed that \nhe did not know what was going on, at some point, COS addressed the situation with \nhim and he did not take appropriate action. He basically ignored all information that \nthere was something terribly wrong happening.  \n \nI find Applicant\u2019s actions as noted above were deliberate and negligent. I find (a), \n(c), (e), (g), and (h) all apply. Although there was evidence that classified material was \ncompromised there was no direct evidence that National Security was breached, and \ntherefore (i) does not apply.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions applicable to this guideline. \nSpecifically I have considered AG \u00b6 35(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the \nbehavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that \nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual currently reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe individual responded favorably to \ncounseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates a positive attitude \ntoward the discharge of security responsibilities\u201d) and (c) (\u201cthe security violations were \ndue to improper or inadequate training\u201d). Applicant has a history of security violations \nstarting in 1978. He had 21 security violations and infractions from 1978 to 1994. He \n\n \n28 \n \n \nadmitted he was counseled about the violations. He received two suspensions without \npay. He then committed two very serious violations, one deliberately changing \nclassification markings on a classified document and transmitting it on an unclassified \ncomputer to a person he had not verified as retaining a security clearance and another \nevent where he allowed a person to have access to classified information for a \nsignificant period of time, after his security clearance was revoked. Applicant has \nexhibited a 28-year history of security violations that escalated in seriousness and \nultimately compromised classified information. Despite counseling and suspension his \nattitude did not change. He has not demonstrated a positive attitude toward the \ndischarge of security responsibilities, but rather has ignored his own personal \naccountability and abdicated and abused his supervisory responsibilities. It is \nundeniable that Applicant has had a prestigious and successful career serving his \ncountry, and that he is respected and admired for his experience and aptitude. \nHowever, there is also a prevalent and troubling attitude and disregard for the \nimportance of following security rules, even at the highest levels, in essence that the \n\u201cend justifies the means\u201d, which is dangerous when one has a duty to protect classified \ninformation and is in a high position of trust and authority. He has repeatedly reflected \nirresponsible conduct and has been personally responsible for security violations. I find \nnone of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered (b) (\u201cdeliberately providing false or \nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security \nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative\u201d) and \n(e) (\u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates \na vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities \nwhich, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding\u2026\u201d). Applicant admitted that he viewed and downloaded sexually explicit \nimages and permitted a guest to access sexually explicit websites on a government-\nissued computer. He stated he believed the government-issued computer was for his \npersonal use. Based on all of the evidence I did not find his statements believable. The \ncomputer had a pop-up government banner warning about its proper use. Other \nevidence presented at his hearing showed he was aware that he was using a \ngovernment-issued computer, but he attempts to mitigate his actions by explaining he \nwas only using it at his residence. He acknowledged he was embarrassed by his \nactions. I find (e) applies with regard to his actions of viewing and downloading sexually \n\n \n29 \n \n \nexplicit images and websites and allowing his guest to inappropriately use a \ngovernment-issued computer.  \nApplicant denied he falsified material facts when he told the OPM investigator \nthat he could not recall suffering any disciplinary actions as a result of his past security \nviolations. At first during his interview with the OPM investigator he denied any security \nviolations, but then later mentioned he had some earlier in his career. It is simply \ninconceivable that he would \u201cnot recall\u201d that he was suspended without pay twice, once \nfor sixteen days and again for ten days. These disciplinary actions are extraordinary \nevents in one\u2019s professional life, and Applicant\u2019s assertion that he could \u201cnot recall\u201d is \nsimply not believable. He was asked about any disciplinary consequences in his past \nand could not recall any. Even if he believed he only had to divulge disciplinary actions \nregarding security violations, he failed to do so. Even if he only believed he had to \ndivulge disciplinary actions within the past five years, he did not divulge his suspension \nfor misuse of a government-issued computer in 2004. Applicant did not dispute the \nOPM investigator\u2019s testimony; he simply could not recall or recollect what had occurred. \nI found her testimony credible. I find Applicant deliberately provided false and \nmisleading information about his past violations, both security-related and otherwise, \nand his past disciplinary actions. Therefore, I find (b) applies. \n \nWith regard to SOR \u00b6 2.c, Applicant provided a written response to DON CAF \ndenying his involvement in allowing an employee (FN D) access to classified \ninformation. I have found, based on the entire record, that Applicant knowingly and \nintentionally allowed FN D access to classified information and the computer system. \nMy analysis is provided above. Therefore, I find (b) applies.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under personal conduct. I have considered all of them and \nespecially considered AG \u00b617 (a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts\u201d); (c) (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (d) (\u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that caused the untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d); (e) (\u201cthe individual has \ntaken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress\u201d) and (f) (\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability\u201d). Applicant\u2019s testimony throughout the proceeding was troubling. On one hand \nhe denied providing false statements. On the other hand he could not recall any of the \npertinent parts of the interview with the OPM investigator, yet he could recall why he \ndecided he did not have to divulge certain negative incidents in his past. I found the \nOPM investigator\u2019s testimony credible. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible. I \nfind none of the mitigating conditions apply. \n\n \n30 \n \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology systems: \u201cNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations, \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability \nto properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information. Information \nTechnology Systems include all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and \ndate used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered (d) (\u201cdownloading, \nstoring, or transmitting classified information on or to any unauthorized software, \nhardware, or information technology system\u201d); (e) (\u201cunauthorized use of a government \nor other information technology system\u201d); (g) (\u201cnegligence or lax security habits in \nhandling information technology that persist despite counseling by management\u201d); and \n(h) (\u201cany misuse of information technology, whether deliberate or negligent, that results \nin damage to the national security\u201d). The allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 2.a are cross \nalleged under Guideline K, handling protected information, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. The facts and analysis are the same as addressed above. Applicant admitted \nhe deliberated removed \u201cSECRET\u201d markings from a document and emailed it on an \nunclassified computer to a person he had not verified had a security clearance. He put \nthe document on a disc, but did not provide information as to the disc\u2019s whereabouts \nother than to say he gave it to his assistant. In addition, he admitted he inappropriately \ndownloaded sexually explicitly material on his government-issued computer and \npermitted a house guest to do the same. I find (d) and (g) apply. I find (h) does not apply \nunder these facts as there is no evidence of damage to national security.  \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under this guideline. Specifically \nI have considered AG \u00b6 41(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one\u2019s password or \ncomputer when no other timely alternative was readily available\u201d) and (c) (\u201cthe conduct \nwas unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a prompt good-faith effort to \ncorrect the situation and by notification of supervisor\u201d). Applicant made a deliberate and \nconscious decision to violate the security rules and download, copy, change \nclassification markings and transmit classified information over an unclassified computer \nand internet based system. His behavior is recent and considering his present and past \nhistory of violating security rules and misusing information technology, I find it casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. His actions in deliberately \nviolating security rules and also his actions of misusing a government-issued computer \nto download sexually explicit material and allow his guest to do the same are not minor. \nEven taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Applicant regarding his misuse of \n\n \n31 \n \n \na government-issued computer, when asked how soon after he became aware the \ngovernment had discovered his violation did he speak with his guest, Applicant stated: \u201cI \nreally don\u2019t remember how soon it was.\u201d He then was asked if it would have been \nimmediately. He responded \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it would have been immediately, but I \nreally don\u2019t recall.\u201d His conduct and response is troubling. He did not take prompt \ncorrective action regarding his guest\u2019s misuse of a government-issued computer. I find \nnone of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a long and \ndistinguished career with the State Department and has the support of high ranking \nofficers. His loyalty and devotion to the mission is not in question. He has received \nregular promotions and served at some of the highest and most prestigious positions in \nour government. He is admired for his unique skills by those for whom he has worked. \nAmong those who provided character statements, he is revered for his work ethic, his \nknowledge and unquestionable loyalty to the United States.  \n \nApplicant has a long history of negligent and deliberate security infractions and \nviolations, beginning early in his career in 1978 and continuing intermittently throughout \nhis career. Some security violations were intentional, serious, involved knowledgeable \nparticipation and occurred after Applicant was trained on security matters. He received \ntwo periods of suspension without pay for his security violations from 1978 to 1990. In \n2001 to 2003, he intentionally accessed sexually explicit websites and downloaded \nimages on his government-issued computer and allowed his guest to do the same. He \nwas counseled and suspended without pay for a ten-day period in 2004 for this offense. \nIn 2005, Applicant knowingly and intentionally permitted a foreign national whose \nsecurity clearance was revoked and for whom he had direct supervision, continued \naccess to classified information. He intentionally bypassed security rules and abdicated \nhis supervisory responsibilities. In 2006, Applicant again deliberately and intentionally \nviolated the security rules by personally downloading a classified secret document from \n\n \n32 \n \n \na classified computer, removing the secret classification markings, then transmitting it \non an unclassified computer through the internet to a recipient that he never verified \nprior to sending the document, was authorized access to classified information. \nApplicant was a mature and experienced senior official at the time these more recent \nsecurity violations occurred and when he was officially disciplined for his actions \nregarding his government-issued computer.  \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator as part of his security \nclearance update and was asked about any prior disciplinary actions he may have had. \nHe knowingly and intentionally failed to fully divulge the extent of his prior conduct or the \nofficial disciplinary actions and punishment he received. His testimony at his hearing \nwas untruthful, repeatedly evasive, and lacked candor. He claimed he could not recall \nmany of the specific and pertinent facts regarding incidents he was personally involved \nin. I have carefully considered all of the evidence and testimony presented at the \nhearing. I have considered the candor and directness of each witness, as well as their \nspecific testimony. I have considered the nine adjudicative factors when analyzing the \nwhole person and how they specifically related to Applicant. Based on all of the \nevidence and my analysis above, the record leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nhanding protected information, use of information technology and personal conduct. \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n33 \n \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances it is not clearly consistent with national security \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On August 20, 2008, after considering the\nrecord (which included submissions by Department Counsel and Applicant), Administrative Judge\nRobert J. Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.   For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\n1\ndecision. \nApplicant essentially contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because\nthe Judge did not give adequate weight to the mitigating evidence and other favorable evidence about\nher life and her military career.  In support of her requests, Applicant summarizes the favorable\nevidence she presented below and describes her ongoing efforts to resolve her financial problems.2\nApplicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \n   \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the close of the record, Applicant still had substantial delinquent\ndebts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were still ongoing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.3, 2007).  The\nJudge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of\n\n3\nthe disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions\nand whole-person factors.  He found in favor of Applicant as to two of the factual allegations listed\nin the SOR.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented\nin mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nrelevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfs.

These debts \nwere incurred over the course of several years. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.c., 1.e.\u20131.i.)  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. has been paid, and the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1c. and \n1.g. are the same debt. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. was sold to a credit management \ncompany and is also alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant asserts this is the same debt.13 \nThis debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.g.) has not been paid. Applicant also provided evidence in \nResponse to the FORM that she is making payments of $500 per month for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e., which is for an automobile. She indicated that these $500 \nmonthly payments began in May 2008 and before that she was making $340 monthly \npayments. She did not provide documentation of this agreement, but she did submit two \nreceipts for the months of May and June 2008 in her Response to FORM. \n \nApplicant denies SOR \u00b6 1.a., which alleges that she filed for Chapter 13 \nBankruptcy in December 2005, and that bankruptcy was dismissed in February 2007 for \nfailure to make monthly payments. She stated that she made a conscious decision to \ndiscontinue her Chapter 13 payment plan because she \u201csought a reamortization of [her] \nloan with [her] mortgage company.\u201d14 The government evidence, which consists of two \ncredit reports, supports the government\u2019s allegations in this regard.15 \n \nApplicant also denied SOR \u00b6 1.d., which alleges that her home mortgage loan in \nthe amount of $112,000 was foreclosed upon for non-payment. The government \nevidence as well as Applicant\u2019s Answer to Interrogatories supports this allegation.16 \n \n \n8 Item 5. \n \n9 Item 4. \n \n10 Item 5. \n \n11 Item 6. \n \n12 Item 7. \n \n13 Item 3. \n \n14 Id. \n \n15 Items 6 and 7. \n \n16 Items 5, 6 and 7. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nApplicant was unemployed from April 2006 to January 2007. She indicated that \nshe recently conferred with a credit counseling service, but did not submit any \ndocumentation reflecting that she retained their services or has an ongoing relationship \nwith them and is following their counsel to resolve her indebtedness. She did state that \nshe was advised by the credit counseling service that she was under \u201cno legal \nobligation\u201d to pay debts alleged in \u00b6 1.b., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.i. because these debts were \n\u201ccharged off.\u201d17 \n \nIn her Response to FORM, Applicant states her plan is to first pay off her \nautomobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) and pay off the remaining accounts until they are \nsatisfied. Per Applicant\u2019s April 2008 Personal Financial Statement (PFS), she has a net \nmonthly remainder of $179.18 after paying all of her bills. This PFS does not address \nthe outstanding debts alleged in the SOR.18 \n \nApplicant offered no documentation that any of her outstanding debts have been \npaid, that she has set up payment plans, or otherwise resolved them. She was awarded \na Bronze Star Medal for service from August 6, 1990 to April 1, 1991 for \u201cMeritorious \nachievement during Operation Desert Storm in connection with military operations.\u201d 19 \nApplicant submitted six reference letters in her Response to FORM attesting to her \ngood character. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n \n17 Item 3. \n \n18 Item 5. \n \n19 Item 3. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d20 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).21 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something \nless than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v.

The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. and \n1.g. are the same debt and it has not been paid or resolved. In Applicant\u2019s favor, the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. has been paid, and she is making automobile payments to \nthe creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e. In the absence of further information, I am unable to glean \nany further information, favorable or unfavorable, with regard to identified financial \nconcerns. \n \n\u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the \nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n \n \n22  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling \nproblems, or other issues of security concern; \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same; \n \n(h) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of living, \nincrease in net worth, or money transfers that cannot be explained by \nsubject's known legal sources of income; and \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets or \nreturning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of gambling \nlosses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay gambling debts, family \nconflict or other problems caused by gambling. \n \nOf the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \nlisted supra, two are applicable: \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \nand FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n\u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,23 I conclude none of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) are applicable or partially \napplicable except for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.h. With regard to these two \ndebts, application of \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts, is appropriate. Applicant presented no evidence \ndocumenting efforts taken to contact creditors, or to resolve any of her other \noutstanding debts since she acquired them.  \n \nI specifically considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b): The conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, and conclude it does not \napply.  \n \nApplicant asserts that she has no legal obligation to pay her \u201ccharged off\u201d debts. \nWhile this may be true in a strict debtor-creditor context, it holds no weight under a \nsecurity clearance analysis. The Appeal Board has frequently held that reliance upon \nlegal defenses, such as the statute of limitations or state debt enforcement provisions, \ndoes not demonstrate honesty and reliability and therefore is of little probative value \nwhen resolving trustworthiness concerns associated with financial problems.24 \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented little or no evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant did not meet her \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision.  \n \nIn fairness to the Applicant, this decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that the Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of financial stability \nnecessary to justify the award of a DoD security clearance. To the contrary, her \nmitigating evidence and whole person analysis suggests a sound potential for positive \nreform and outstanding accomplishments in the defense industry. Should Applicant be \nafforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, she may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d25 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines.

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \nOn October 31, 2007, Applicant signed a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions, \nStandard Form (SF) 86. The application (Item 6) was submitted on November 14, 2007 \nto request a security clearance. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \nOn June 12, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \n(Item 1), that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nn the record. \n                                                          \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG). \n \nApplicant received the SOR on July 15, 2008 (Item 2). She responded on July \n30, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing (Item 3). Her Answer was \nincomplete, and on August 6, 2008, DOHA requested that she submit a complete \nresponse (Item 4). Applicant forwarded a second Answer, dated August 25, 2008 (Item \n5). In her second Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations except 1.e.2 On \nFebruary 18, 2009, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials \n(FORM)3 in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Other than the \ndocuments already identified, the FORM contained Applicant's response to DOHA \ninterrogatories (Item 7), and three credit bureau reports (Items 8, 9 and 10). Applicant \nwas given 30 days from the date she received the FORM to file a response, but did not \nrespond. The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2009, for an administrative decision \nbased o\n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 30 years old, is employed by a defense contractor. According to \ninformation she provided in her security clearance application, she is unmarried, and \nhas a nine-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter. The application contained no \ninformation on her educational background. Applicant worked as a customer service \nrepresentative from 1998 to 2001, and a collections representative for a telephone \ncompany from 2001 to 2003. She also was employed as an invoicing representative for \none year, and a warehouseman for two years from 2004 to 2006. She held a position for \napproximately seven months in 2007 as a shipping and receiving clerk, before starting \nher current employment as an inventory specialist in October 2007. Applicant was \nunemployed for six months in 2003 (Item 6).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly income includes earnings of $2,960, and child support \nof $276, for a total of $3,236. After deductions of $1,830, her net monthly income is \n$2,107. Appellant's monthly expenses are $2,415. This figure does not include her rent \nof $875, because her boyfriend now pays their mortgage (Items 3; 7). After expenses, \nApplicant's monthly net remainder is negative $307. When Applicant\u2019s car payment of \n$533 is deducted, her monthly expenses exceed her income by approximately $841 \n \n2  Applicant attached to her Answer four documents supporting her claim that she paid several alleged \ndebts. I will identify these documents as Answer document 1 (re allegation 1.e.); Answer document 2 (re \nallegation 1.a.); Answer document 3 (re allegation 1.h.); and Answer document 4 (not related to debts \nalleged in the SOR). \n \n3 See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included 10 documents (Items 1 - 10) proffered \nin support of the government\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n(Item 7). Applicant noted that she lives \u201cwith my boyfriend and the mortgage is paid by \nhim as well as the water. We have a baby together so he helps with the bills\u201d (Item 3). \nShe did not indicate how much he contributes to her financial support. \n \n \nThe eleven SOR debts amount to $9,726. Applicant provided evidence that she \nsatisfied five of the alleged debts:  \n \n\u2022 1.b. (medical debt of $133, see Answer document 2) \n\u2022 1.e. (cable debt of $172; see Answer document 1) \n\u2022 1.h. (medical debt of $154; see Item 7 and Answer document 3) \n\u2022 1.i. (collection debt of $1,119; confirmation number X4A2456259) \n\u2022 1.j. (collection debt of $788; confirmation number 2698291) \n \nThe paid debts total $2,366. When these debts are excluded from the SOR total, \nApplicant's unpaid debt amounts to $7,360. \n \n \nApplicant's debts became delinquent between 2003 and 2007 (Item 10). \nHowever, her 2009 credit bureau report shows medical debts totaling approximately \n$4,246 that did not appear on her earlier credit bureau reports. It also indicates that, \ncompared to the amounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant's  debt listed at allegation 1.f. \nhas increased by more than $300, and the debt alleged at 1.k. has increased by \napproximately $70 (Items 8 through 10). \n \n \nApplicant states in her Answer that she is a hard worker and has received letters \nof appreciation and recognition from her employers. She did not submit performance \nevaluations or character references. Applicant also noted that she does not \u201chave a \ncriminal background and haven\u2019t been in any trouble.\u201d Applicant noted in her Answers, \nwithout further explanation, that \u201cI may have not made the best choice when I was \nyounger, but I\u2019m older and wiser now.\u201d She also stated that, \u201cI know I\u2019m the one who \nmade the mistakes and I will have to suffer the consequences.\u201d (Item 5). Applicant did \nnot indicate that she experienced major events that affected her ability to pay her debts \nsuch as medical emergencies, divorce or unexpected financial setbacks. \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors \nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative \nof a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines \nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent \n \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this \ncase, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration \nof the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest5 for an Applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the  \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as her or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may \nlead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe evidence contained in the FORM shows that Applicant has been accruing \ndelinquencies since 2003. She currently owes past-due debt of $7,360, and new debt of \n$4,246. Her six-year history of failing to meet her financial obligations supports \napplication of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b619 (a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following conditions that can potentially mitigate security \nconcerns are relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, and did not occur in the distant past, \nbecause many of them are still delinquent. In addition, Applicant made no effort \nbetween 2003 and 2007 to deal with her overdue debts. Finally, the new debts that \nhave appeared on her most recent credit bureau report indicate that delinquencies are \nlikely to recur in the future. Her conduct casts doubt on her reliability and good \njudgment, and AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot be applied. \n \n \nIt is commendable that Applicant paid five of the SOR debts. But it must be noted \nthat two were paid in April 2008, around the time Applicant received the DOHA \nInterrogatories, and two were paid in August 2008, after she had received the SOR. The \ntiming of the payments raises the question as to whether they were simply a response \nto the security process, rather than a good-faith effort. In addition, the greater part of \nApplicant's delinquent debt remains outstanding. Her recent credit bureau report shows \nthat additional debts have become delinquent within the past few months, after the \nsecurity process was underway. The record includes no evidence that Applicant has a \nplan in place to resolve either the remaining SOR debts or the new delinquencies. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) does not apply. I find against the Applicant under Guideline F. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited Guideline. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nApplicant has accrued more than $9,000 in delinquencies since 2003. The \nrecord contains no evidence that, between 2003 and 2007, she took any steps to \nresolve it. In 2008, after Applicant received the DOHA Interrogatories, she paid more \nthan $2,000. While it is commendable that she has resolved some portion of her debt, \nthe fact that she did not make an effort to resolve her debts until prodded by the security \nclearance process raises doubts about her judgment and reliability. Given the fact that \nshe has a substantial amount of delinquent debt remaining, and that she has accrued \nnew debt, I cannot confidently predict that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be \nresolved. A fair and common-sense assessment of the available information bearing on \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows she has not satisfied the doubts \nabout her ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests. Because protection \nof the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be \nresolved in favor of the government.8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:.  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c. \u2013 1.d.  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f. \u2013 1.g.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h. \u2013 1.j. \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k. \u2013 1.l.  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto allow Applicant access to classified information.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Position (SF 86) on June 11, \n2007.  On December 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns for \nfinancial considerations under Guideline F.  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 22, 2008. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 30, 2008.  He denied two of \nthe allegations under Guideline F but admitted one allegation, that his home was \nforeclosed in 2004.  He provided detailed information on his finances, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non January 28, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on March 11, 2009.  DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on March 27, 2009, for a hearing on April 15, 2009.  I \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 7, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered six exhibits, marked \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6, which were received without objection.  \nApplicant submitted 15 documents, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through O \nwhich were received and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant testified on \nhis behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 30, 2009.  Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDepartment Counsel notified Applicant in early March 2009 that he had his \nrequest for hearing and sought Appellant's availability for a hearing.  After both parties \nconsulted with me, I issued a Notice of Hearing on March 27, 2009, for a hearing on \nApril 15, 2009.  Applicant received the Notice of Hearing on April 7, 2009.  Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days notice of a hearing (Directive, E3.1.8).  While Applicant knew of the \nhearing prior to March 27, 2009, official notice in this case was only about eight days.  \nApplicant specifically waived his rights to the 15 days notice (Tr. 9).   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough reviewed of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted one and denied two of the \nallegations under Guideline F.  He provided additional information to support his request \nfor eligibility for a security clearance. \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and has worked as a technician and database \nadministrator for a defense contractor for almost ten years.  He has been married for 39 \nyears, and has two grown children.  He served almost 22 years on active duty in the Air \nForce as a technician for missile and communications equipment.  He successfully held \na security clearance while on active duty.  He received an Honorable Discharge in \nSeptember 1989 (Tr. 10-12; Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for Sensitive Position, dated \nJune 13, 1007; App. Ex. C, DD 214, Retirement Certificate and Retirement Orders, \ndated September 30, 1989).  In response to Interrogatories from security adjudicators, \nApplicant listed his monthly net salary as $4,450, with monthly expenses of $3,504 \nwhich includes payments on his debts.  Applicant has net monthly disposable or \ndiscretionary funds of $946 (Gov. Ex. 2, Answer to Interrogatories, dated August 19, \n2008).  Applicant verified at the hearing that this information is still accurate (Tr. 32-34). \n \nApplicant received many awards while on active duty.  He received two awards \nof the Meritorious Service Medal, four awards of the Air Force Commendation Medal \n(App. Ex. D, Citations, various dates), and five awards of the Air Force Good Conduct \nMedal (App. Ex. F, Citation, dated October 6, 1982).  He was also recognized as Career \nNon-Commissioned Officer of the Quarter for 1983 (App. Ex. E. Recommendation, \ndated November 22, 1983).  He received numerous Letters of Appreciation for his Air \nForce work (App. Ex. G, Letters of Appreciation, various dates), and a Letter of \nCommendation (App Ex. H, Letter of Commendation, April 8, 1980).  Applicant has \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbeen recognized by various civic organizations for his volunteer contributions (App. Ex. \nI, Jaycees certificate, 1989; App. Ex. J, Youth Club Letter of Appreciation, dated April 2, \n1986; App. Ex. K, Muscular Dystrophy Association Letters of Appreciation, dated \nDecember 11, 1985; App. Ex. L, Special Olympic Appreciation Award, dated October \n14, 1985; and App. Ex. M, Girl Scout Service Certificate, dated June 8, 1983).     \n \nApplicant has also been commended by his employer for his work.  A logistics \nmanager for a defense contractor notes that she worked with Applicant for over ten \nyears.  She regards him as professional and dependable and she relies on his insight \nfor their work.  She states that he has high ethics and integrity.  The contract site \nmanager for his company notes he has known Applicant for over five years.  Applicant \nshows he is an honest man with impeccable character and is a role model for others.  \nHe is always trustworthy and a man of his word.  The range manager for his company \nnotes the he worked with Applicant for almost ten years and sees him on a daily basis.  \nApplicant always conducts himself professionally and his work ethic and morale integrity \nare beyond reproach.  A co-worker and friend notes Applicant is honest and will go to \nextremes to help others.  When the co-worker became seriously ill, Applicant help \nensure that the witness' medical insurance was able to pay for his medical expenses \n(App. Ex. N, Various Letters, dated in April 2009).   \n \nCredit reports show that Applicant had the following delinquent debts; a charged \noff account on a second mortgage for $19,735 (SOR 1.a), an account in collection for \n$63 (SOR 1.b), and that his house was foreclosed in 2004 (SOR 1.c).  Applicant \nadmitted SOR allegation 1.c, but denied both SOR allegations 1.a, and 1.b.  There is \napproximately $30,000 in other debts listed on the credit reports.  All these other debts \nare listed on the reports as being paid as agreed.  He pays more than the minimum at \neach payment.  He owns a 1998 and a 2002 vehicles that are paid (Tr. 34-37; Gov. Ex. \n3, Credit Report, dated June 14, 2007; Gov. Ex. 4, Credit Report, dated September 4, \n2008).   \n \nAfter retiring from active duty in October 1989, Applicant worked various jobs.  In \nFebruary 1992, he started working for a state agency he had worked for as a youth \n(App. Ex. B, Employee Action Form, dated January 24, 1992).  He purchased a house \nusing a Veteran's Administration mortgage (VA).  He also took out a second mortgage \nto construct an in-ground swimming pool.  After working for the state agency for seven \nyears, Applicant was offered a position with a defense contractor in another state \nworking in the same field he worked while on active duty in the Air Force.  This \nnecessitated a fast move to a new state.  He tried to sell his house in the original state \nbut was unsuccessful.  He was successful in renting the house for a year.  After a year, \nhe could neither sell the house nor find another renter.  He continued to pay the \nmortgage for at least another year while also paying the mortgage on his new house \nwhere he now lived and worked (Tr. 18-19; App. Ex. O, Applicant's statement, undated).   \n \nApplicant had difficulty paying two mortgages and also keeping two houses in \ngood repair.  He contacted the VA for guidance concerning the original house that was \nnot occupied.  They suggested he let the house go to foreclosure.  He notified the \n\n \n4 \n \n \nholder of both the first and second mortgage of his intent to let the house go to \nforeclosure so the companies could establish their claim in the foreclosure.  Both \ncompanies acknowledged receipt of the notification letter (App. Ex. A, Letters, dated \nMarch 11, 2003).  Both companies were also notified of the foreclosure by the court.  \nThe holder of the original or first mortgage established their claim in foreclosure but the \nsecond mortgage holder refused to establish a claim or participate in the foreclosure.  \nThe first mortgage holder tried to work with Applicant on the debt but the second \nmortgage holder (SOR 1.a) was uncooperative and continued to \"harass\" him \nconcerning the loan.  He feels that if the second mortgage holder had perfected their \nclaim in the foreclosure, their debt would have been settled.  In response to the SOR, \nApplicant included a summary of complaints from others gathered from the Internet \nconcerning the actions of the second mortgage holder.  The house was valued at \n$100,000.  The first mortgage amount was approximately $78,000, and the second \nmortgage was approximately $20,000 (Tr. 38; App. Ex. O, Statement, undated; See \nCase file, Response to SOR, dated December 30, 2008).   \n \nSOR allegation 1.a is the charged off of the second mortgage by the mortgage \nholder that did not participate in the foreclosure.  SOR allegation 1.c, which Applicant \nadmits, is that the house was foreclosed in 2004.  Applicant never heard from the VA \nconcerning the foreclosure, and did not receive any papers from the foreclosure.  He \nhas never received correspondence concerning any further debt from the first mortgage \nholder or the VA.  There is no mention of a claim by the first mortgage holder on any \ncredit report.  He assumes the first mortgage holder had been satisfied by the \nforeclosure (Tr. 37-39).  \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.b is an account in collection for $63 for an electrical \ncompany.  Applicant was not aware of any debt owed to an electrical company.  He \ninquired of the collection agency concerning the debt but they refused to provide him \nany information.  He has not been sent a bill concerning electrical service.  He never \nhad electrical work done on the house that was foreclosed.  Applicant's only explanation \nfor the debt concerns a house he lived in prior to the house that was foreclosed.  His \nsister-in-law lived in this house after him, and the electrical service was still in \nApplicant's name.  When the sister-in-law left the house, the electricity was to be shut \noff and transferred to new owners or tenants.  He is not sure that the transfer was timely \nand he may have been charged for about one month of electrical use by others.  He has \nnever received a bill from the electric utility (Tr. 39-41).   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  The delinquent debts for a second mortgage and an unpaid utility bill as \nlisted on the credit reports are a security concern raising Financial Consideration \nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), \nand FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).   \n \n \nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) raised \nby Applicant's testimony.  FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was \nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) \napplies.  While the mortgage foreclosure took place in 2004, the second mortgage still \nhas not been satisfied.  Also, the electrical debt from 2002 still has not been paid.  While \nthese are current debts, they arose under unusual circumstances.  His house was \nforeclosed and the creditors notified.  One creditor participated in the foreclosure and \nwas paid.  The other creditor did not participate and was not paid.  He has been current \non mortgage payments for his present residence for over ten years.  The circumstances \naround the electrical utility debt are unknown.  These two debts are not likely to recur \nsince he is current on his present mortgage and his utility bills.  All present debts are \npaid as agreed.  The debts do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment.  Applicant is solidly employed and his debts are under control.  His \nfinancial problems should not recur.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies.  Applicant encountered financial \nproblem when he moved to another location for a new job and could not sell his house.  \nHe rented the house for a year and continued to pay the mortgage for another year.  \nWhen he could no longer afford to pay two mortgages, he consulted the mortgage \nguarantor for advice how to proceed.  He was told to go to foreclosure.  He notified the \nmortgage holders of the foreclosure.  One mortgage holder participated and was paid.  \nThe other mortgage holder did not participate and has not been paid.  The house \nappears to be valued at a sufficient price to satisfy both mortgage holders.  He inquired \nabout the electrical utility debt but was not provided any information by the utility or \ncollection agency.  Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances to control and \nmanage his debts. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay them, and \nhas shown a good-faith effort to pay them.  Applicant notified the second mortgage \nholder of the foreclosure action but that creditor decided not to participate in the \nforeclosure.  The second mortgage holder was not paid in the foreclosure since they did \nnot participate.  It appears the sale of the house would have generated sufficient funds \nto cover this creditor.  The creditor was not paid through their actions and not a refusal \nby Applicant to pay the mortgage.  The creditor and collection agent for the electrical \nutility debt refused to provide Applicant sufficient information to pay the debt.  Applicant \nhas not incurred additional delinquent debts and all of his debts are paid as agreed.  \nApplicant acted responsibly towards his debts, and established his good-faith efforts to \nresolve his debts.  He mitigated security concerns for his financial situation. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant's 22 years of \nactive duty and honorable retirement from the Air force.  I considered he successfully \nheld a security clearance while on active duty.  I considered his awards and decorations \nfor military service.  I also considered the opinion of his supervisors and coworkers as to \nhis professionalism, honesty, reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.  I considered his \nexcellent and extensive civil volunteerism.  Applicant encountered mortgage problems \nwhen he took a new position in another state and tried to sell his house.  He could not \nsell it but continued to either rent it or pay the mortgage for two years.  When he could \nno longer afford to pay two mortgages, he received guidance from the mortgage \nguarantor to go to foreclosure.  He notified the mortgage holders of the foreclosure.  \nOne participated in the foreclosure and that debt was satisfied.  The other refused to \nparticipate and that debt is not satisfied.  Applicant did all he could to satisfy and clear \nthe mortgages on this house.  He paid the mortgage for two years after moving and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfollowed the advice of the mortgage guarantor about going to foreclosure.  He is \nunaware of a debt to an electrical utility and the collection agency refused to provide \ninformation for him to understand and pay the debt.  Applicant lives within his means \nand meets his personal financial obligations.  All of his present debts are paid as \nagreed.  His actions do not indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations.  He is not financially overextended, and his finances \ndo not create a security concern.  Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me \nwith no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  \n(e-QIP) on September 4, 2007. On February 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 7, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 28, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 1, 2009. On June 18, 2009, a Notice of Hearing \nwas issued, scheduling the hearing for July 14, 2009. The case was heard on that date. \nThe Government offered four exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits \n(Gov) 1 \u2013 4. The Applicant testified and offered three exhibits which were admitted \nwithout objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - C. The record was held open until July \nAugust 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n28, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  He timely submitted a 21-\npage document that was admitted as AE D. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE D is \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The transcript was received on July 31, 2009.  Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old engineer with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking to maintain his security clearance. He has been employed with his company \nsince May 2005. He has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering. He \nserved in the Air National Guard from 1995 to 2005. He enlisted, attended Officer \nTraining School (OTS), and achieved the rank of First Lieutenant. He is single and has \nno children. (Tr at 5-6, 40; Gov 1.)  \n \nOn September 4, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance. Applicant \nanswered \u201cyes\u201d in response to question 28(a) \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over \n180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He listed a mortgage foreclosure in February \n2003. He did not list any other debts. (Gov 1.)  \n \nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant has the following \ndelinquent accounts: a $153 cell phone account placed for collection in October 2006 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 51; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 4); a $1,475 account placed for collection \nin March 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 4 at 4); a $2,595 credit card account placed for \ncollection in July 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 2 at 50; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 4); a $3,878 credit \ncard account placed for collection in September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 50; Gov 4 at \n4); a $2,673 cell phone account placed for collection in August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 \nat 50; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 5); a $3,260 electronics department store account placed for \ncollection in December 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 2 at 51; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 6); a $3,576 \ncredit card account placed for collection in June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 2 at 52; Gov 4 at \n8); a $2,474 debt owed to an apartment complex placed for collection in September \n2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 2 at 52; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 8); a $60 medical account placed \nfor collection in September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 4 at 11); and a $483 telephone \naccount placed for collection in June 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 2 at 50; Gov 3 at 3). \n \nSix months after graduating from college in 2000, Applicant purchased a home. \nHis first job was a contract job which he believed was going to last for several years. He \nearned approximately $80,000 a year. After one year, the contractor cancelled the \nproject. He was unemployed for approximately two months. He found a job but earned \nhalf of what he was making in his previous job. His reduced income and money \nmismanagement resulted in a mortgage foreclosure in 2003 and several delinquent \naccounts.   (Tr at 30-32; Gov 2 at 8)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant claims that he tried to pay off some delinquent accounts but ran into \nsome unscrupulous credit collection agencies.  While he admits that he incurred several \ndelinquent accounts, he will not pay the collection agencies who now own the debts. He \nhas made no attempt to dispute any of the accounts with the credit reporting agencies. \nHe is concerned that any contact with creditors who own his older debts will extend the \namount of time they will be listed on his credit reports. His plan is to wait for the debts to \nbe removed after seven years on his credit report. (Tr at 33, 36, 50, 56) (Section 605 of \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act provides that accounts placed for collection or charged to \nprofit and loss that are more than seven years old are to be excluded from consumer \ncredit reports.) \n \nApplicant disputes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h which is a $2,474 debt owed on \nan apartment lease. Applicant lived in the apartment complex. He broke his lease early \nbecause he accepted employment in another state. Applicant did not have a transfer \nclause in his lease. The apartment complex agreed to accept another tenant, commonly \nreferred to as a sub-lessee. The new tenant did not pay rent and moved out before \nApplicant\u2019s lease was up so they held him responsible for the remainder of the lease. \nHe refuses to pay this debt. (Tr at 37-39) \n \nApplicant disputes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e which is a $2,673 cell phone \naccount that was placed for collection. Applicant arranged for a female acquaintance to \nhave a cell phone on his account. The account was in his name only. It was agreed that \nthe female acquaintance would pay her portion of the bill.  She did not pay her portion of \nthe bill. (Tr at 59-60) \n \nApplicant claims that all of the disputed debts are old. The statute of limitations \nfor enforcement of the debts is four years in the state where he previously resided and \nis four years in the state where he currently resides. Applicant is repaying all of the \ndebts that he does not dispute. Only two undisputed debts remain, his school loans and \na credit card, neither of which are alleged in the SOR. (Tr at 22-23) He paid off one \nstudent loan account. (AE D at 20)  \n \nIn response to interrogatories dated October 10, 2008, Applicant completed a \npersonal financial worksheet. He listed his net monthly income as $3,780.88. He listed \nhis monthly expenses as $1,445. He listed his monthly debt payments as $683.65. After \nhis expenses and debts were paid, he had approximately $1,652.23 left over each \nmonth. (Gov 2 at 34)  \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant indicated that since completing the personal \nfinancial worksheet, his salary has increased. A pay statement dated June 30, 2009, \nindicates Applicant\u2019s gross bi-weekly pay is approximately $2,407.69, which is \n$4,915.38 monthly. (Tr at 72; AE A) He indicated that his rent is $400, his groceries are \n$200 a month and his utility and car expenses are less but provided no figure. He has \ntwo cell phone accounts which cost him $150 a month. He does not own real estate.  \nHis cars are paid for. He owns a 1999 truck, a 1988 car, and a 1998 18 foot boat.  He is \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncurrent on taxes and is not delinquent on any of his current debts. (Tr at 72-79) He has \napproximately $32,552.84 in a 401(k) plan. (Tr at 26; AE D at 12-19)     \n \nAt the close of the record, none of the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.j were \nresolved.  \n \nApplicant claims that he did not list his delinquent accounts in response to \nsection 28(a) of the e-QIP application because he was uncertain that he needed to list \ndebts which he disputes. He claims he misunderstood the question.  He listed his \nmortgage foreclosure in response to the question. On November 13, 2007, he fully \ndisclosed the delinquent accounts that he disputes to the investigator conducting the \nbackground investigation. (Tr at 66-69; Gov 2 at 30) He disagrees with the investigator\u2019s \ncomments in the summary of the unsworn interview that stated that Applicant failed to \nlist his delinquent debts out of concern it could cause him to lose his security clearance \nand lose his job. (Tr at 69; see Gov 2 at 12)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent performance appraisal covering the period of June 1, \n2008, to June 1, 2009, rated his overall performance as \u201cvery good\u201d. He scored a \u201c4\u201d on \na scale with \u201c5\u201d being the highest rating. (AE C) His awards and decorations while \nserving in the Army National Guard include the National Defense Service Medal, the \nArmy Service Ribbon, Governor\u2019s Unit Citation, and the Army Achievement Medal. He \nalso received several certificates and awards. (Tr at 41, AE D at 2-11, 20)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant encountered financial \ndifficulties after graduating from college in 2000. The SOR alleged 10 delinquent \naccounts, an approximate total balance of $20,627. \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\n \n6 \n \n \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has had financial problems over the past nine years. Although his current \nfinancial situation is relatively stable, ten delinquent accounts remain unresolved. \nApplicant took no steps to resolve any of the delinquent accounts. While he claims the \ncollection agencies are unscrupulous, he admits that he may have incurred these debts. \nHe did not formally dispute these accounts with the credit reporting agencies.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to Applicant\u2019s two-\nmonth period of unemployment after his first job, and his significantly reduced income \nwhen he obtained employment. However, I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances because he has ignored the delinquent debts that he incurred \nduring this timeframe. He was able to save $32,000 in his 401(k) account, but \ndeliberately ignored his early financial obligations. For this reason, this mitigating \ncondition is given less weight.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. All ten \ndelinquent accounts remain unresolved.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s plan to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts is to passively wait until the debts are removed from his credit \nreport after seven years. He also claims that most of the debts are beyond the statute of \nlimitations and are unenforceable. He has not made a good-faith effort to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts.  \n \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s statute of limitations argument, the DOHA Appeal \nBoard has long held that: \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not controlled or limited by any statute of \nlimitation. Absent an explicit act of Congress to the contrary, the federal \ngovernment is not bound by state law in carrying out its functions and \nresponsibilities. A security clearance adjudication focuses on evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Even if a \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndelinquent debt is legally unenforceable under state law, the federal \ngovernment is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy debt in \na timely manner. ISCR 02-14950 at 4 (App. Bd. May 15, 2003) See also \nISCR 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. June 6, 2008); ISCR 03-04779 at 4 (App. \nBd. July 20, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 2-3 (App. Bd. March 27, \n2003). \n \nApplicant\u2019s plan to resolve his delinquent accounts is to wait for them to be \nremoved from his credit report after seven years in accordance with Section 605 of the \nFair Credit Reporting Act.  However, the Appeal Board has held that the fact that debts \nwill be removed from applicant\u2019s credit history in the near future does not preclude their \nreview for security purposes: \n \n\u2026the removal of those debts from his credit report does not make them \ndisappear as if they never existed or preclude the Judge from considering \nother record evidence that shows those debts exist. The security \nsignificance of Applicant\u2019s credit history does not turn on whether \nApplicant\u2019s debts could or could not be legally listed on a credit report after \nthe passage of seven years. ISCR 02-14950 at 4 (App. Bd. May 15, \n20030; See ISCR Case 98-0111 at 3 (App. Bd. November 13, 1998).   \n \nFor the reasons mentioned above, Applicant has not demonstrated a good-faith \neffort to resolve his debts.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply. Although Applicant disputes all of the accounts alleged in the \nSOR, he has not expressed a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of his past-due \ndebts. He never formally disputed any of these accounts with the credit reporting \nagencies.  He did not provide sufficient documentary evidence to support that any of \nthese debts were not his responsibility.  \n \nWith regards to the $2,673 cell phone debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, Applicant \nmade an error in judgment by allowing a friend to have a cell phone on his account. The \ncell phone company was not a part of this agreement. The account was in his name \nonly. He is responsible for the debt.  \n \nNot enough information is provided about the apartment lease debt that is \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. It is not clear that Applicant was released from the terms of his \noriginal lease when he found a person to sublet the apartment. Since the new tenant did \nnot pay the rent and moved out before the end of his lease term, the apartment \ncompany may have a legitimate right to hold him responsible for the unpaid remainder \nof his lease term as well as any damages. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence \nto support his dispute with this debt.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhile Applicant appears to have the means to resolve his delinquent accounts, \nhe has decided to passively wait for the statute of limitations and for the seven-year \nperiod when the debts will be removed from his credit report. He has not mitigated the \nconcerns raised under Guideline F.  \n   \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list all of his  \nfinancial delinquencies in response to sections 28(a) on his electronic questionnaires for \ninvestigations processing, dated September 4, 2007.  \n \n  \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) is relevant to Applicant\u2019s \ncase. For PC DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission of his delinquent accounts must \nbe done with a deliberate intent to deceive. Applicant\u2019s interpretation of the question \nwas to list delinquent debts that he did not dispute.  He listed his mortgage foreclosure \nin response to the question. Once the question was clarified upon meeting with the \ninvestigator in November 2007, Applicant fully discussed all of his delinquent accounts, \nthe majority of which he disputes.  Although the personal subject interview which was \nprepared by the investigator who interviewed Applicant infers Applicant admitted to \nintentionally omitting his delinquent debts on his security clearance application out of \nfear of losing his security clearance and, as a result, his job, it is not given much weight \nbecause it is unsworn and Applicant disputes the summary of the investigator\u2019s \ninterview. In addition, the interviewer did not testify during the hearing and was not \nsubject to cross examination. Based upon the weight of the evidence, I find Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation for not listing all of his delinquent accounts to be credible.  \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern is found for Applicant.  \n \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nwork performance and his ten years of honorable service in the Army National Guard. \nHowever, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nthe security concerns raised under financial considerations. He did not formally dispute \nany of his delinquent accounts with the credit reporting agency. In fact, he admits that \nhe incurred the delinquent debts. Rather than honoring his past financial obligations, \nApplicant intends to wait until they are removed from his credit report in accordance with \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act. He did not mitigate the concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated because Applicant did not \nintend to falsify his security clearance application. Applicant did not meet his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On July 21, 2008, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\nNovember 20, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included 11 documents (Items 1 - 11) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial\n2\nconsiderations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR whereby he admitted with explanation all\nof the allegations and requested a decision without a hearing. On September 23, 2008,\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM)  in support of the\n3\ngovernment\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant received the FORM on October 2, 2008,\nand was given 30 days to file a response to the FORM. He timely responded to the\nFORM and the case was assigned to me on November 5, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant owed approximately $30,118 for 15 delinquent\ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.o. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with\nexplanation all of the allegations. He also claimed, and Department Counsel concedes,\nthat the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n are duplicates of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.d,\nrespectively.

He also showed that\nhe is paying the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e according to settlements he\nhas negotiated with each creditor.\nApplicant is 37 years old and requires a security clearance as part of his work for\na defense contractor for whom he has worked since April 2006. He has held a security\nclearance since 1989 when he was in the Navy. Applicant was married in October 1994\nbut divorced in November 2004. The marriage produced one child, for whom Applicant\nwas ordered to pay monthly support. There is no information showing he has failed to\nmeet that obligation.\nAs part of his work with a defense contractor, he moved to an overseas job site in\nMay 2006. Applicant asserts some of his debts were left over from his marriage and that\nothers were accounts for which he did not receive bills when he moved overseas. \nApplicant provided information during the adjudication of the results of his\nbackground investigation showing he has a positive monthly cashflow of about $2,225\nafter expenses. In response to the FORM, he also averred he is more closely\nmonitoring his credit and has taken steps to improve his ability to manage his finances.\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n3\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support all of the allegations\nin the SOR. Even though SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n are duplicates, available information\nshowed Applicant still owed about $22,718 for 12 delinquent debts. Some of those\ndebts had been due since 2003.  Accordingly, the government\u2019s information required\napplication of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nIn response, Applicant presented information showing that some of his debts\nwent unpaid because of his divorce or because of his overseas move. He also showed\nthat, of the 12 debts still attributable to him, only two debts totaling less than $2,000\nhave not been paid or otherwise resolved. He further showed his current finances are\nsound and that he has taken steps to improve his ability to manage his money. The\nrecord also shows he has not incurred any new delinquencies since moving overseas in\n2006. Accordingly, the record requires application of the mitigating conditions listed at\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), 20(b)(the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), and 20(c)\n(the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). Owing to the\npositive information about his finances and the documented payments to his creditors, I\nconclude Applicant has presented sufficient information to mitigate the security\nconcerns raised by the government\u2019s adverse information about his finances. \n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n5\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 37 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. He has held a security clearance without incident for\nabout 19 years. He has been thorough and straightforward in his response to the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns about his finances. While it would have been preferable for him\nto have addressed his debts earlier than he did, the fact remains all but about 10% of\nhis debts have been addressed. His income is more than sufficient to pay his remaining\nobligations while avoiding future delinquencies. The facts and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s finances do not present an unacceptable risk to the national interest were\nhis access to classified information to continue. A fair and commonsense assessment8\nof all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances shows he has addressed\nsatisfactorily the government\u2019s doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests as his own.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I - 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted. \nApplicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR was notarized by a notary public whose\ncommission expires on August 23, 2010. The answer was not time-stamped as having\nbeen received by DOHA, so it is officially accepted. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJuly 18, 2008, and the hearing was held on August 7, 2008. At the hearing, three exhibits\n(GE 1 through 3) were admitted in evidence without objection to support the\nAugust 29, 2008\n\n2\ngovernment\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s four exhibits (AE A through AE D) were received in\nevidence without objection. He also testified. In the time allowed for Applicant to submit\nadditional documentation, he submitted AE E (a performance evaluation), AE F (a\nsecond payment to SOR 1.b. creditor), and AE G (a savings account printout). DOHA\nreceived the transcript, and the record closed on August 15, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant essentially admitted the three allegations under the financial\nconsiderations guideline of the SOR. He denied two of the allegations because he had\nsettled with or established payment plans with the creditor. \nApplicant is 29 years old. He is divorced, and presently lives with his soon-to-be\nwife and their three-month-old baby. He began working as a welder for his current\nemployer in September 2007. He seeks a security clearance. \nApplicant completed high school in 1997 with a high school diploma. His security\nclearance application (SCA, GE 1) reflects he was employed with more than 20\nemployers between 1997 and September 2007, when he landed his current employment.\nMost of the jobs involved welding, with a few jobs handling heavy equipment. In\nFebruary 2005, Applicant enrolled in vocational college. In May 2005, he received his\ndegree as a certified welder. Though he did not provide a simple explanation for\nnumerous job changes in a short period of time, I find immaturity and financial\nirresponsibility played a large part in not remaining at a job for a sufficient time period. \nSOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.c. GE 3 show that Applicant opened three credit card accounts\nin 2001 and 2002. He made the minimum monthly payments for about three or four\nyears, but occasionally fell behind as indicated by the credit report (CR, AE 3). In 2004,\nhe stopped paying SOR 1.a. altogether. The debt is currently more than $12,500.00\nbecause of the penalties and interest that have accrued. He fell behind in payments due\nto his changing job situation, low paying jobs, and marital problems. The total delinquent\namount for the three accounts is $22,000.00. \nApplicant met his former wife in approximately December 2006 at a motor bicycle\nrace. In May 2006, Applicant began working as an independent contractor, where he\nwould hire out his services. Three to four days in a week, he would work on contracts. In\nthe last few days of the week he would search and negotiate new contracts for the\nupcoming week. As an independent contractor, he earned between $1,500.00 and\n$3,000.00 a month, depending on the job requirements and the type of heavy equipment\nhe would have to rent for the contract. Sometimes, he was unsuccessful in obtaining new\njobs, which meant unemployment on a sporadic basis for different periods of time. \nIn August 2006, Applicant discontinued working for himself, married his girlfriend,\nand began employment with her father as a heavy equipment operator. Applicant did not\nknow his bride had a drug problem, and did not want to work for a living. As the sole\nmeans of support for his wife and her stepchild, Applicant struggled to make ends meet,\n\n3\nand was unable to maintain any payments on increasing number of delinquent debts,\nincluding those listed in the SOR. \nAfter three months of marital trouble, Applicant obtained a divorce from his wife.\nShortly thereafter, Applicant lost his job with her father. Applicant believes he was\nterminated because her father was disgruntled over his divorce. \nBetween November 2006 and March 2007, Applicant was unemployed. During\nthe unemployment, Applicant sold his racing motorcycle. Realizing he was having\nfinancial problems, his mother decided to provide him financial and moral support. \nAfter returning to one of his previous jobs for about four months, Applicant began\nwelding for his current employer in September 2007. Since then, Applicant has settled\nwith the SOR 1.b. and 1.c. creditors. See, AE B and AE C. On June 13, 2008, he\nlaunched a repayment plan with SOR 1.a. and has made two payments pursuant to the\nplan. See, AE D and AE F. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s mother is proud of her son\u2019s accomplishments in the past year. Taking\na keen interest in his job, paying his bills as AE D and AE F show, and taking care of his\nfuture wife and young child, Applicant convinces his mother that he is becoming\nfinancially responsible. Since June 2008, he has been paying his mother about $200.00\na month for the money she lent him to settle SOR 1.b. and 1.c. \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluation for September 2007 through June 28, 2008\nindicates that he is a hard-working employee who is knowledgeable about his profession.\nAE G shows that Applicant has opened a savings account.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d \nThe SOR identifies three delinquent debts totaling approximately $22,000.00. The\ndebts became delinquent between 2004 and 2007. financial considerations (FC)\ndisqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC\n19.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nThere are five mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances. They are: FC MC 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); FC\nMC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the\n\n5\nperson\u2019s control, and the individual acted reasonably under the circumstances); FC MC\n20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is resolved or under control); and FC MC 20.d. (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts). FC\nMC 20.a. applies in part. Though the financial irresponsibility occurred in the last four\nyears, the number of past due debts were few in number. Applicant, with the help of his\nmother, has taken substantial steps to pay off/settle the accounts, while establishing\ndocumented job security to support his application for a security clearance. \nApplicant is entitled to substantial mitigation from FC MC 20.b. based on the\nextenuating marital problems he encountered in 2006, and good-faith repayment efforts.\nHe exercised poor judgment by not ascertaining the full picture of his former wife before\nhe married her. However, he displayed good judgment for officially ending the\nrelationship after only three months, rather than compounding his emotional and financial\nproblems by trying to make an unsuccessful marriage work. Within six months of his\ndivorce in November 2006, he began to turn his life in a positive direction that his mother\nis proud of. \nBecause of the timely help of his mother, Applicant receives mitigation under FC\nMC 20.c. The lifestyle Applicant led before November 2006 shows that he needed the\nproactive financial help of his mother. Because of her assistance, he is more concerned\nabout his future now, and realizes that financial responsibility is an essential part of\ncontinued stability in his future. By settling with two creditors and establishing a payment\nplan with the third creditor, Applicant has adduced documented evidence of bringing his\nfinancial obligations under control. His settlements demonstrate good faith efforts to\nrepay overdue creditors. The FC guideline is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and whole person concept. The WPC is made of nine general policy factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nthe participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s short history of financial problems has provided a much clearer picture\nof his immaturity and irresponsibility over the last 10 years. However, he fully recognizes\nthat his divorce in November 2006, and subsequent period of unemployment was a\n\n6\ndefining moment in his life. Since that time, his life has undergone some striking\nchanges. With the help of his mother in paying off his debts, Applicant has reestablished\nstability in his lifestyle by mitigating the financial concerns. Having viewed the evidence\nas a whole, I find for Applicant under the FC guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 42 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Electrical Technician and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Statement of Reasons sets forth three separate creditors totaling in excess of approximately $ 12,000.00. The Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated September 18, 2007, and August 22, 2008, reflect each of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR. (Government Exhibits 2 and 5). From November 1984 until April 1993, the Applicant served on active duty in the United States Navy before he was honorably discharged. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L). During some of this time, he held a security clearance. The Applicant\u2019s marital history shows that he has been married three times and divorced twice. In 1987, the Applicant got married and had two children. He and this wife divorced in 1995/96. He remarried in 1997/98, and he and his second wife divorced in 2003. In September 1998, th",

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 25, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on August 29, 2008.  On July 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 4, 2008, and requested\na hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned Administrative Judge on September 19, 2008.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on September 23, 2008, scheduling the hearing for November 6, 2008.  At the\nhearing the Government presented six exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1\nthrough 6.  The Applicant presented fourteen exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\nA through M.  He called one witness and testified on his own behalf.  The official\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on November 21, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 42 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nElectrical Technician and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Statement of Reasons sets forth three separate creditors totaling in excess\nof approximately $ 12,000.00.  The Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in\nthe SOR.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated September 18, 2007, and August 22,\n2008, reflect each of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 2\nand 5).\nFrom November 1984 until April 1993, the Applicant served on active duty in the\nUnited States Navy before he was honorably discharged.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L).\nDuring some of this time, he held a security clearance.  The Applicant\u2019s marital history\nshows that he has been married three times and divorced twice.  In 1987, the Applicant\ngot married and had two children.  He and this wife divorced in 1995/96.  He remarried\nin 1997/98, and he and his second wife divorced in 2003.  \nIn September 1998, the Applicant started his own housing interior trim business.\nThe business was not successful, his income dropped dramatically, and he began to\nhave financial problems.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G).  The Applicant testified that he paid his\nsmaller debts, but could not afford to pay the larger ones.  (Tr. p. 59).  The debt\nreflected in the SOR, specifically allegations 1(a), 1(b) and 1(c), is his larger debt that\nwas incurred during his previous marriages.  In May 2008, in order to resolve his\nindebtedness, the Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7. The debts\nset forth in the SOR were discharged.  (Government Exhibit 3 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\nand B).  The only asset the Applicant received from the resolution of his marriages was\nwhen his house was sold.  The Internal Revenue Service credited the money toward the\ndebt he owed and his tax lien was released.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C and Tr. p. 57).  \nIn 2005, he married his current wife.  The Applicant is now current with all of his\nfinancial obligations and living within his means.  His net salary of $2,800.00 a month is\nsufficient to comfortably pay all of his monthly expenses.  He is also current with his\nchild support payments which are automatically deducted out of his payroll check.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J).  In addition to his salary, he receives a 10% disability check from\nthe Department of Veteran Affairs.  His wife is also employed and contributes between\n\n3\n$900.00 and $1100.00 per month to support her two children and miscellaneous\nexpenses.   \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nher personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) dated August 29, 2007.  Question 28(b) of the application asked\nwhether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on ay debts?  The Applicant\nanswered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  He failed to list the delinquent debts set\nforth in the SOR.\nThe Applicant testified that he did not list his three delinquent debts in response\nto question 28(b) because he was not aware of them.  He did not think that he had any\ndelinquent debt to speak of and if he had been aware that he had any, he would not\nhave answered, \u201cNO\u201d to the question.  (Tr. p. 34). \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor and friend testified that the Applicant is a self-\nstarter, good worker, punctual, responsible and trustworthy.  (Tr. p. 67-71). \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor, professional\ncolleagues, co-workers and friends attest to his strong work ethic, superb customer\nservice skills, honesty, integrity, and overall sense of excellence.  He is well respected\namong and highly recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).\nApplicant\u2019s recent performance appraisal indicates that he \u201cconsistently exceeds\u201d\nrequirements in every category.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M).  He also recently received a\nsalary increase for his excellent work performance.  (Tr. p. 51).\nApplicant completed a debt counseling session on the internet on April 10, 2008.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H). \nApplicant has received several certificates of completion for specialized training\nin his field of expertise.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n4\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\nNone.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n5\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility and/or dishonesty\nwhich demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  Two divorces and an unsuccessful business venture caused the\nApplicant\u2019s financial indebtedness.  He has, however, since then, made a good faith\neffort to resolve his past due indebtedness.  He has paid off his small debts and filed for\nChapter 7 Bankruptcy protection and discharged his larger debts.  He understands the\nimportance of paying his bills on time and not living beyond his means.  He is current\nwith all of his financial obligations and is living within his means.  Under the\ncircumstances, he has made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is\nevidence of financial rehabilitation.  The Applicant has demonstrated that he can\nproperly handle his financial affairs.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20.(b) the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances; 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control and 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\n\n7\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nThere is no evidence to demonstrate that the Applicant deliberately falsified his\nsecurity clearance application when he failed to list his three delinquent debts.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is found for the Applicant.   \n \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, and a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person would properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, and the Applicant has mitigated\nthe negative effects of his financial indebtedness and the effects that it can have on his\nability to safeguard classified information.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.    \n     \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n8\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not correctly weigh Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.  Applicant argues that this evidence was\nsufficient to warrant a favorable decision.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations and had only recently started to resolve her financial problems.  In light of the foregoing,\nthe Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant as to two of\nthe SOR factual allegations, but reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient\nto overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 29, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On October 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nFebruary 20, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because her SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 5, 2008. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, notarized, but undated, received by DOHA on November 10, 2008, \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to \nproceed on December 2, 2008, and the case was assigned to Administrative Judge \nMichael H. Leonard on December 8, 2008. On January 5, 2009, because of caseload \nconsiderations, it was reassigned to me. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 12, \n2009, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on January 29, 2009. During the \nhearing, four Government exhibits and one Applicant exhibit were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on \nFebruary 4, 2009.   \n \n \nThe record was kept open until February 12, 2009, to enable both parties to \nsupplement the record by submitting their own respective recent versions of credit \nreports.  The Department Counsel submitted one such report on February 4, 2009, and \nApplicant submitted another such report on February 6, 2009.  Both submissions were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough 1.g., 1.l., and 1.q., of the SOR.  She denied the remaining allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been with \nthe same employer since May 1997, and currently serves as an aircraft mechanic.1 She \nis seeking to retain the SECRET security clearance previously granted to her in about \nSeptember 1997.2 Applicant has never been married,3 but does have three children, \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP, dated Jun. 29, 2007), at 10. \n  \n2 Id. at 23. \n \n3 Id. at 12. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nborn in 1981, 1984, and 1988, respectively.4 As of June 2007, her children were still \nresiding with her.5 \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant\u2019s finances commenced a downward spiral, but the \nvarious credit reports in evidence would seem to indicate her problems started about \nthe time some accounts were sent to collection as early as 2001.

Several \naccounts became delinquent and were either \u201ccharged off\u201d or placed for collection.  \nNotwithstanding the collection activities of her creditors, when Applicant completed her \ne-QIP in June 2007, she denied having any accounts delinquent over 180 days, \nalthough she did acknowledge one account, not referred to in the SOR, to be delinquent \nover 90 days.6 \n \nApplicant ignored her debts until she received Interrogatories pertaining to her \nfinances from DOHA in late May or early June 2008. On June 2, 2008, she furnished \nanswers to those Interrogatories,7 and stated she was currently being advised by a \ncredit counselor on correcting and reestablishing good credit.8 In reality, it was not until \nJune 13, 2008, that she entered into a contract with a credit consultant for \u201ccredit \nconsultation and guidance,\u201d and made the initial payment of an eventual total of \n$850.00 for such consultation and guidance.9 She was advised not to pay any listed \ndebt,10 and as of the date of the hearing, has not paid any creditor.11 \n \nThe first step in her effort to correct and reestablish credit was to dispute each \nderogatory account listed on her credit reports, regardless of the validity of the listing, \nwith the ultimate goal of reducing any outstanding balances to manageable amounts \nbelow $1,000.00.12 She intends to dispute each debt, even two or three times, to \nmotivate the creditors to make more favorable settlements as to the outstanding \nbalances.13 As a result of those initial disputes, some of the accounts were deleted from \nthe most recent credit reports. \n \n \n4 Id. at 14-16. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Id. at 24-25. \n \n7 Government Exhibit 2 (Interrogatories, dated June 2, 2008). \n \n8 Id. at 4. \n \n9 Applicant Exhibit A (Contract, dated June 13, 2008), at 1-2. \n \n10 Tr. at 23. \n \n11 Id. at 41. \n \n12 Id. at 40-43. \n \n13 Id. at 26, 42. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR identified 18 purportedly continuing delinquencies.

Quite to the contrary, her lengthy period of inaction towards her \nSOR debts and her recent and continuing efforts in universally disputing them, \nregardless of their validity, to motivate the removal of such debts from her credit report \nfor a variety of reasons, seemingly including removal after seven years of inactivity, \n                                                          \n14 Id. at 43-44. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nerror, or satisfaction, do not support her stated intention that she will satisfy the \nremaining delinquent financial obligations.15  Applicant has continuously ignored even \nthe smallest of her SOR debts. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d16 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \n \n15 Tr. at 48. \n \n16 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns as well. The evidence is sufficient to establish AG && 19(a) and 19(c). \n \nApplicant has been gainfully employed since before her financial difficulties \nbegan. As a single parent of three children, she was confronted with the usual lifestyle \nchoices and expenses, none of which appear to be unexpected or beyond her control. \nShe received something of value, including either a service, a loan, or an object, for \neach of the SOR debts, including those she admitted and denied. She obtained and \nfurnished her children with cell phones, but refused to pay the bills; received medical \nservices which were supposedly to have been paid by insurance, but were not; obtained \nseveral loans which she failed to repay; and used credit cards but did not maintain \ncurrent balances. What was purportedly a willingness, accompanied by an inability, to \nsatisfy debts, became more clearly an ability, accompanied by an unwillingness, to \nsatisfy them. \n \nApplicant\u2019s clear intention is not to pay her SOR debts until such time as they are \neither removed from her credit report or the outstanding balances are greatly reduced. \nFurthermore, the fact that an otherwise valid delinquent account has been removed \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nfrom a credit report without an indication that the entry was originally erroneous, does \nnot eliminate the responsibility of the debtor to repay that debt.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfailure or refusal to address even the smallest of her SOR delinquencies raises \nconcerns about recurrence of delinquent debts and her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence fails to establish AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@17 Also, AG & 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue\u201d may apply. In June 2008, after receipt of the DOHA \nInterrogatories, Applicant sought the assistance of a credit counselor on correcting and \nreestablishing good credit. She failed or refused to pay any of her delinquent debts prior \nto that time, and upon obtaining guidance from her credit counselor, decided to dispute \neach and every account regardless of validity. \n \nApplicant\u2019s intention was to see if she could get some of the accounts removed \nfrom her credit report and motivate the remaining creditors to reduce their outstanding \nbalances. In this instance, the credit counseling is insufficient to establish that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control. And, there is no credible evidence \nApplicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her \ndebts.  While 10 of the 18 listed SOR delinquencies have dropped off her credit report, \nApplicant has offered no evidence of any payment negotiations or payments on any of \nthose accounts which she acknowledged were valid. Additionally, for those SOR debts \nthat she denied, she did so not because they were not legitimate or valid debts, but \nbecause they were either not on a credit report she obtained or because she initially did \n \n17 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nnot recognize the listed creditor. In some of those instances, the creditor listed was that \nof a collection agency or collection attorney. Instead, Applicant has apparently \nattempted a scheme to avoid her financial responsibilities. The evidence fails to \nestablish AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d). \n \nAs to AG \u00b6 20(e), Applicant has offered no reasonable basis to dispute most of \nthe SOR debts that she denied. Nor has she offered any documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of her disputes or provided any evidence of actions to resolve the \nindividual issues. Instead, she simply disputed everything. The sole exceptions, are \napparent from a review of the evidence, and those are the debts listed as SOR \u00b6 1.h. \n(which she has denied), which is a duplicate of the debt listed as SOR \u00b6 1.d. (which she \nhas admitted), and SOR \u00b6 1.m. (which she has denied), and SOR \u00b6 1.e. (which she has \nadmitted). \n \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s extensive financial delinquencies, which continue \nunaddressed, her professed ability to satisfy those accounts for which the outstanding \nbalances fall below $1,000.00,  and her scheme to avoid responsibility for the other \noverdue debts, Applicant has not demonstrated her financial responsibility.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant was the gainfully employed single parent of three children. Nothing has \nchanged. She was confronted with the normal expenses of family life and had to make \nlifestyle and financial decisions the same as the multitudes of Americans. Applicant \nroutinely and voluntarily obtained something of value, including either a service, a loan, \nor an object, for each of the SOR debts she admitted responsibility for, which were \nincurred from a wide variety of creditors, but either had no ability or intention to pay for \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nthem. As a result, she accumulated extensive new delinquent debt.  (See AG & 2(a)(1) \nthrough AG & 2(a)(4).) \n \nOnly when motivated by the receipt of Interrogatories from DOHA, and the \nconcern of having her security clearance eligibility reviewed, did she take the first step \nof seeking guidance from a credit counselor. Upon obtaining guidance from her credit \ncounselor, Applicant decided to dispute each and every account regardless of validity, \nand has refused to make any good-faith efforts to pay a variety of delinquent debts \nlisted in the SOR.  Instead, she preferred to wait for some of the debts to drop off her \ncredit report, and hope that the remaining delinquent balances are reduced. (See AG & \n2(a)(6), AG & 2(a)(7), and AG & 2(a)(9).) While some of these debts may eventually \nbecome uncollectible, failure to repay creditors reflects traits which raise concerns about \nher fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a)(5).) \n  \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all her debts are resolved; it is whether \nher financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security \nclearance. I am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put \nApplicant\u2019s credit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of \nthis case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a \npiecemeal analysis.18 Considering the absence of any good-faith efforts, her universal \ndispute of otherwise valid delinquent financial obligations, her continuing refusal to \naddress her debts, and her current financial situation is sufficient to raise continuing \nsecurity concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n18 See U.S. v.

Garcia, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has abstained from alcohol since December 2004, following his fifth arrest \nfor drunk driving. He completed court-ordered treatment and has been actively involved in \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) for over four years. His alcohol dependence is in full, sustained \nremission with a highly favorable prognosis for continued sobriety. Clearance granted. \n \n \nStatement of the Case  \n \nOn August 12, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nG (Alcohol Consumption), which provided the basis for its preliminary decision to revoke \nhis security clearance. DOHA took action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \n \nMay 11, 2011\n\n \n \n2 \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on September 10, 2010, and he \nrequested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on November 3, 2010, to consider \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On November 12, 2010, I scheduled a hearing for December 15, \n2010. \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Eleven Government exhibits (Ex. 1-11) were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant questioned the relevance of another document, which \nDepartment Counsel chose not to submit. The SOR was later amended at the \nGovernment\u201fs request without objection to strike from the SOR the allegation addressed in \nthe withdrawn document. Applicant and a witness testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on December 23, 2010. I held the record open for post-hearing submissions from \nApplicant. Five Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-E) were admitted after the hearing.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nSOR Amendment \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government withdrew a criminal record before it was marked in \nresponse to Applicant\u201fs concerns about its relevance. The document on its face pertained \nto the drunk-driving offense alleged in what was then SOR 1.e, but Applicant was not the \ndefendant named in the court record. The Government moved to amend the SOR to strike \nSOR 1.e and re-letter the subsequent allegations. Applicant did not object. The SOR was \namended, and the allegations in SOR 1.f\u20131.i became SOR 1.e\u20131.h. \n \nPost-Hearing Exhibits \n \n \nApplicant offered AA attendance records as Exhibit A, and a certificate of \ncompletion of a court-mandated second offender driving under the influence (DUI) program \nas Exhibit B. He had only originals of the documents, which he wanted to retain in his \npossession. The proposed exhibits were marked for identification, and their admission was \nmade contingent on post-hearing submission of copies and no valid objections from \nDepartment Counsel. At Applicant\u201fs request, I ordered the record held open until January \n14, 2011, for Applicant to also undergo, and submit a report of, a recent alcohol evaluation, \nand to submit other documents, including character reference letters. \n \n \nOn January 4, 2011, Applicant timely forwarded a copy of his AA attendance \nrecords (Ex. A), a letter that he authored (Ex. C), a report of a substance abuse evaluation \n(Ex. D), and a reference letter from his AA sponsor (Ex. E.) On January 7, 2011, I gave \nDepartment Counsel until January 18, 2011, to file any objections. I also reminded \nApplicant that the record was still open should he choose to submit a copy of the certificate \nand related documents previously marked as Exhibit B at the hearing. On January 10, \n2011, Applicant submitted a copy of the certificate and related discharge summary and \ndiagnostic reports. Department Counsel did not object to their admission, and Applicant \nexhibits A through E were accepted into the record. \n \n\n \n \n3 \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \nThe amended SOR alleged under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, that Applicant \nwas diagnosed with alcohol dependency around December 2005 following a relapse, and \nthat he was still participating in a recommended outpatient program as of August 2010 \n(SOR 1.a). Applicant was also alleged to have consumed alcohol, at times to intoxication \nas frequently as weekly, from age 17 or 18 until at least December 2004 (SOR 1.b); to \nhave been convicted and placed on probation for unlawful possession of a controlled \nsubstance and public drinking in August 1976 (SOR 1.h); to have been arrested for driving \nunder the influence in April 1977 (SOR 1.g), April 1985 (SOR 1.f), May 1987 (SOR 1.e), \nFebruary 1999 (SOR 1.d), and December 2004 (SOR 1.c); and to have been convicted and \nsentenced for the 1985, 1999, and 2004 offenses.1 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the charges and sentences as alleged in SOR 1.c, \n1.d, 1.f, and 1.g. He denied the remaining allegations. His admissions are incorporated as \nfindings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 52 years old, and he works for a defense contractor. He started as an \ninspector for the company in August 1978, and from March 1992 until September 2009, he \nworked as an assembler at a different work location than his present assignment. In May \n1992, he was granted a confidential-level security clearance (Ex. 1.), which he seeks to \nretain. (Tr. 123.)  \n \n                                                 \n1All of his drunk-driving offenses occurred in the same state. The Government referred to the offense as \nDriving under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) or DUI-liquor in SOR 1.c and 1.d, and as OUI-Liquor or OUI in \nSOR 1.e through 1.g. The pertinent state law governing drunk driving is titled as follows and provides in part: \n \n\u00a7 90:24. Driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, etc.; second and subsequent \noffenses; punishment; treatment programs; reckless and unauthorized driving; failure to stop \nafter collision \n \nWhoever, upon any way or in any place to which the public has a right of access, or upon any \nway or in any place to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees, \noperates a motor vehicle with a percentage, by weight, of alcohol in their blood of eight one-\nhundredths or greater, or while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, or of marijuana, \nnarcotic drugs, depressants or stimulant substances, all as defined in section one of chapter \nninety-four C, or the vapors of glue shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred \nnor more than five thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than two and one-half \nyears, or both such fine and imprisonment. . . \n \nThe statute provides for increasing fines and jail terms depending on the number of prior convictions or times \nthe defendant has been assigned to an alcohol or controlled substance education, treatment, or rehabilitation \nprogram by a court of the commonwealth or any other jurisdiction. In the court records, the offense is referred \nto as \u201cOUI-Liquor\u201d (Ex. 5, 6) or \u201cOperating Under the Influence of Liquor\u201d (Ex. 7, 8), although the registry of \nmotor vehicles uses the term \u201cDWI Liquor.\u201d (Ex. 2.)  \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \nA victim of sexual abuse during his youth (Tr. 55-59.), Applicant began drinking \nalcohol at age 17 or 18. He drank socially with friends on weekends, usually two or three \ncans of beer. In August 1976, Applicant was charged with public drinking and with \npossession of a controlled substance. Applicant was parked in a local park with a friend, \nwhen a police officer searched his vehicle and found a beer and a small amount of \nmarijuana. Applicant was found guilty of both charges. He was placed on probation for six \nmonths for the drug charge and fined $10 for public drinking. (Ex. 3; 10; Tr. 34, 60-61.) \n \nDuring the daytime hours on April 19, 1977, Applicant was pulled over by local law \nenforcement for crossing the yellow line. The officer thought he had been drinking, which \nApplicant denies, and he was told to remain off the road for the rest of the day. Later that \nnight, the same officer observed Applicant driving around with his friends, and he arrested \nhim for OUI. Applicant had consumed a couple of beers with his friends. He was ordered \nby the court to attend a weekly counseling program held at a local hospital. On April 21, \n1978, the charge was dismissed. (Ex. 3; 9; Tr. 62-64.) Applicant does not recall the \nspecifics of counseling. (Ex. 3; Tr. 63.) He believes he was arrested unfairly in retaliation \nfor Applicant\u201fs family seeking redress following an attack by the officer\u201fs dog. (Tr. 34-35.)  \n \nApplicant continued to drink alcohol socially on the weekends, becoming intoxicated \nno more than twice per week, after he started working for his present employer in August \n1978. He did not consume any alcohol before going to work. (Ex. 3.) \n \nIn June 1981, Applicant fractured two vertebrae in his neck and suffered a \nconcussion in a serious car accident en route to work. He was a passenger in a vehicle \ndriven by a friend. Applicant had a long recovery and suffered from complications that left \nhim unable to work for 18 months. Financial pressures, due in part to non-covered medical \nexpenses, led him to move in with his parents and to take a second job at a local officers\u201f \nclub every Thursday through Saturday. He eventually resumed drinking alcohol in anger \nover the manner in which his lawsuit was resolved against the person responsible for the \naccident. (Ex. 3; Tr. 39-42, 65.) \n \nIn late April 1985, Applicant was returning home on his motorcycle from his part-time \njob at the officers\u201f club when he pulled over to urinate. A law enforcement officer stopped \nand smelled alcohol on Applicant\u201fs breath. Applicant refused to submit to a sobriety test, \nand he was arrested for OUI. (Ex. 3; Tr. 65-66.) Applicant admitted sufficient facts and was \nfound guilty. He was assessed fines and costs totaling $140, placed on probation until May \n16, 1986, and ordered to attend a second offender\u201fs program. He was discharged from \nprobation on March 30, 1987, after he satisfied all conditions. (Ex. 3; 8.) Applicant was \ndiagnosed at the second offender\u201fs program as having an addictive personality related to \nalcohol. (Tr. 66-67.) \n \n In late May 1987, Applicant drank four or five eight-ounce beers while socializing \nwith some friends at a restaurant. He and his friends were all on their motorcycles with \nApplicant in the lead when he decided to pass a vehicle. The vehicle suddenly turned left, \nand Applicant failed to make the corner. (Tr. 78.) Applicant was treated for minor injuries at \na local hospital, and his blood alcohol content was reported to the police. Applicant was \n\n \n \n5 \ncharged with OUI and with a civil infraction of failing to drive a safe distance to the left of \nthe other vehicle. He admitted sufficient facts and was found guilty of OUI in July 1987. He \nwas assessed costs and fees totaling $215, placed on probation until July 13, 1988, and \nordered to attend an alcohol safety action program. He also lost his driver\u201fs license for 45 \ndays. Applicant satisfied all requirements, and he was discharged from probation in July \n1988. (Ex. 3; 7; Tr. 67-71.) \n \nApplicant made a concerted effort to abstain from alcohol after the 1987 OUI, \nalthough he continued his second job at the officers\u201f club. (Ex. 3; Tr. 71.) In May 1994, he \nand his spouse married, and they had a son in October 1994. Cancer was detected in the \nplacenta, which led to unexpected surgery for his spouse, and his father died the night \nbefore his son was born. (Ex. 3; Tr. 71-72.) Applicant initially coped with the stress and \ngrief without drinking, but he relapsed around 1995. (Tr. 73.) \n \nApplicant struggled to remain sober on his own. He drank mostly beer after work on \nthe weekends to relax and relieve stress caused by financial pressures. (Tr. 76.) He and \nhis spouse had issues financing construction on their home. (Tr. 79-80.) In mid-February \n1999, Applicant was involved in a one-car accident while driving home from his second job \nafter a 16-hour work day. He was intoxicated after drinking at the officer\u201fs club and was \ncharged with OUI. Convicted in March 1999, he was ordered to attend a 24-day alcohol \neducation program and counseling; to pay OUI fines and fees of $375; to serve on \nprobation until March 2001, conditioned on no alcohol, random screens, and payment of \nprobation supervision fees; and to surrender his license for 90 days. He fulfilled the \nconditions and was dismissed from probation in March 2001. (Ex. 3; 6.) \n \nApplicant became involved in AA after the February 1999 OUI. He became \nsecretary of an AA group that met on Sunday mornings, and he was abstinent from alcohol \nfor at least two years. (Tr. 36, 83.) Around 2002, he learned that his spouse had been \ndiagnosed with cancer for the second time. He began consuming a few drinks to relax \nbefore driving home from his second job. (Ex. 3; Tr. 84.) \n \nOn December 4, 2004, after putting in a full day for the defense contractor, \nApplicant drank two 16-ounce vodka cocktails while working a wedding at the officers\u201f club. \n(Tr. 85.) Drowsy while driving home around midnight, he almost collided with a police car \napproaching in the other direction. Applicant failed a breathalyzer test, and he was charged \nwith OUI, fifth offense, marked lanes violation, and failure to wear a seat belt. On \nDecember 13, 2004, he was released on an electronic bracelet for work purposes only, \nconditioned on abstinence from alcohol and illegal drugs, random screens, and no driving a \nmotor vehicle. (Ex. 5.) When he had the opportunity to call home, Applicant\u201fs spouse \ninformed him that it was time for him to own up to \u201call the wreckage.\u201d Applicant \u201chit bottom\u201d \nwhen he heard his then 10-year-old son \u201ccrying, wondering when dad was going to come \nhome.\u201d He resolved not to drink alcohol in the future. (Tr. 99.) \n \nUnder a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty in late October 2005 to an amended \ncharge of OUI, second offense. He was sentenced to two years in the house of corrections, \nwith 12 days to be served on the weekends and the remainder suspended for five years. \n\n \n \n6 \nApplicant was placed on probation with electronic monitoring until October 26, 2010. (Tr. \n94.) He was assessed OUI fines and fees totaling $900, $125 for the motor vehicle \nviolations, and a probation fee of $65 per month. Applicant was also ordered to complete a \n14-day inpatient treatment program with follow-up, to submit to random alcohol and drug \nscreens, to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) with an approved sponsor or other 12-step \nprogram, and to complete 80 hours of community service. (Ex. 3; 5; 11.) Applicant\u201fs license \nwas revoked for ten years by the registry of motor vehicles. (Ex. 2; Tr. 86.) He was allowed \nout of the house two or three days a week after 6:30 p.m., and he used his time to attend \nAA meetings. (Tr. 48.) \n \n \nAfter his arrest for OUI in December 2004, Applicant resigned from his part-time \nemployment at the officers\u201f club (Ex. 3.), and he stopped drinking. (Ex. D.) On December \n11, 2005, Applicant entered the court-mandated 14-day residential driving under the \ninfluence of liquor (DUIL) program, which consisted of a comprehensive substance abuse \nevaluation, individual and group counseling, alcohol and drug education, and self-help \nmeetings. A screening test of December 19, 2005, was positive for a diagnosis of alcohol \nabuse. Applicant successfully completed the program and was discharged on December \n24, 2005. It was recommended that he pursue counseling, not drink and drive, and attend \ntwo AA meetings weekly. A licensed alcohol and drug counselor (LADC) with the DUIL \nprogram assessed Applicant\u201fs risk of recidivism as high, but he opined that Applicant\u201fs \nprognosis should improve provided he remains sober and attends self-help meetings \nregularly. (Ex. B.) Applicant participated in a 26-week outpatient program, and he \ncontinued with individual counseling through at least May 2007. (Ex. 1.) \n \n \nOn May 8, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) from which a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) was \nprepared. Applicant responded \u201cYes\u201d to whether he had ever been charged with a felony, \nand he disclosed his December 2004 OUI. In response to question 25, concerning any \nalcohol-related treatment in the last seven years, he listed counseling from April 2005 to \nMay 2007. (Ex. 1.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed about his alcohol offenses on July 5, 2007 and November \n19, 2007, by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). \nDuring his initial interview, Applicant discussed a relapse around 1994 on learning of his \nspouse\u201fs cancer diagnosis and his December 2004 OUI. He expressed his belief that he \ndoes not have an alcohol problem, but that he is better off if he stays away from alcohol. \nHe indicated that he began counseling in April 2005. Applicant denied any intent to use \nalcohol in the future, and he added that he was attending AA three times a week. In \nNovember 2007, Applicant was re-interviewed for the details of his earlier OUI offenses. He \nacknowledged that he had turned to alcohol for relaxation and stress relief and that he had \nbeen diagnosed with an alcohol problem. (Ex. 3.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on June 5, 2008, that he \ndid not intend to consume alcohol in the future and that he was attending AA three to four \ntimes a week. (Ex. 4.) Available documentation shows Applicant has attended on average \nbetween two and three AA meetings per week since June 2006, with some increase in the \n\n \n \n7 \nfrequency of his attendance to four or five meetings per week at times in 2009 and 2010. \n(Ex. A; Tr. 89.) Applicant has not consumed alcohol since December 2004.2 (Tr. 90.) He \nnow understands that he is an alcoholic. (Tr. 94-95.) \n \n \nA fellow member of Applicant\u201fs AA home group, which meets on Thursday nights \n(Tr. 120.), has observed Applicant on commitments where Applicant shares his experience \nwith alcohol and recovery. (Tr. 114-.)  He sees Applicant at AA meetings at least five days \na week. (Tr. 116.) Since they first met at an AA meeting in October 2009 (Tr. 115.), this AA \nmember has observed Applicant make big strides in working on the emotional issues that \naccompany alcoholism. (Tr. 118-19.) \n \n \nOver the past four years, Applicant has held an AA meeting on a regular basis for \npersons being treated on the detoxification unit of a substance abuse treatment facility. \n(Ex. A; Tr. 93-94.) Applicant\u201fs sponsor, who has over 16 years of sobriety, has observed \nApplicant take on the role of sponsoring others in the AA program. In this sponsor\u201fs \nopinion, Applicant has \u201cbuilt a solid commitment to himself and his family making his \nsobriety and recovery the main priority in his life.\u201d (Ex. E.) Applicant sees his sponsor at an \nAA meeting every Thursday and tries to talk with him daily. (Tr. 91-92.) Applicant also \ncontacts another AA member, who regularly attends his Monday night meeting. This AA \nmember runs an employee assistance program for a large corporation. Applicant also \nattends a Wednesday night step meeting when he is not going on a commitment. He has \nbeen through the AA steps twice and is re-working his moral inventory (step four). \nApplicant is still dealing with the issue of making amends to the person who abused him \nduring his youth. (Tr. 96-97.) Applicant sponsors two people in AA, and his spouse is \ninvolved with Al-Anon. (Tr. 91-92.) \n \nIn mid to late December 2010, Applicant underwent a substance abuse evaluation \nby a local LADC with 20 years of experience in the substance abuse field. The LADC had \ntwo individual sessions with Applicant. He also spoke with Applicant\u201fs spouse and \nApplicant\u201fs AA sponsor by telephone. Applicant\u201fs spouse and his AA sponsor confirmed \nApplicant\u201fs active engagement in AA, reporting that Applicant attends regular meetings, \ncontacts his sponsor, sponsors other recovering alcoholics, and has in-depth knowledge of \nthe 12-step program. As reflected in his report of January 2, 2011, the LADC diagnosed \nApplicant with alcohol dependence in full, sustained remission (no signs of dependence or \nabuse in the past 12 months). He assessed Applicant\u201fs prognosis as \u201chighly favorable.\u201d \nApplicant appeared to have made \u201cthe necessary changes in his lifestyle to sustain \nongoing sobriety long into the future.\u201d (Ex. D.) \n \n \nApplicant has never had an alcohol-related incident at work or been disciplined as a \nresult of drinking. (Tr. 38-39.) In November 2010, he became eligible to regain his license \nfor work purposes only. As of December 2010, he had not yet requested a hearing for the \nconditional reinstatement of his driver\u201fs license. (Tr. 86-87.) \n \n                                                 \n2 Applicant testified that he last consumed alcohol on December 7, 2004, the day of his OUI. (Tr. 90.) The \ncourt record reflects an offense date of December 4, 2004, although the complaint was not filed until \nDecember 6, 2004. (Ex. 5.) \n\n \n \n8 \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u201eright\u201f to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u201fs suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u201fs eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u201fs overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See \nalso EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \n\n \n \n9 \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nThe concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u201fs reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u201fs August 1976 public drinking and August 1977 OUI arrests were alcohol-\nrelated incidents of the type contemplated in AG \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away \nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, \ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d However, the evidence falls short \nof establishing that Applicant was intoxicated on either occasion. \n \n \nStarting in the mid-1980s, Applicant turned to alcohol to cope with stressful \ncircumstances in his life. His four OUI offenses, committed between April 1985 and \nDecember 2004, implicate AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed \nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or \nalcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d also applies. Applicant admitted to an OPM \ninvestigator in November 2007 that he had been diagnosed with an alcohol problem by \nclinicians affiliated with court-ordered counseling for his December 2004 OUI. A screening \ntest administered to Applicant during the 14-day residential program in December 2005 \nwas positive for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse. In addition, an LADC with 20 years of \nexperience recently diagnosed Applicant with alcohol dependence in full, sustained \nremission. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(f), \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program,\u201d is not conclusively established. Although Applicant \nwas ordered to attend a treatment program at a local hospital after his May 1987 OUI and \nto complete a 14-day alcohol education program and counseling after his February 1999 \nOUI, there is no record of a diagnosis in either case, and not enough is known about the \ntreatment programs themselves to trigger AG \u00b6 22(f). Nonetheless, the seriousness of \nApplicant\u201fs alcohol problem is objectively shown by his relapses into drinking with OUI \nincidents after lengthy abstentions from late May 1987 to 1995 and 1999 to 2002, and in \nthe case of his December 2004 OUI, after some exposure to AA. \n \n \nSix years have passed since Applicant\u201fs last OUI, but it is difficult to apply mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u201fs current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d given \nApplicant\u201fs four OUI convictions. Concerning the potential applicability of  AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe \nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of abuse, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if \n\n \n \n10 \nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser),\u201d Applicant completed a \nsecond offender\u201fs program after his April 1985 OUI, an alcohol safety action program after \nhis May 1987 OUI, a 24-day alcohol program after his February 1999 OUI, and a 14-day \ninpatient DUIL program with follow-up counseling after his December 2004 OUI. All of \nthese programs were court-ordered and not voluntary. Furthermore, while he stopped \ndrinking after his last OUI, he denied that he had an alcohol problem when he was \ninterviewed in July 2007 by an OPM investigator. However, his sustained involvement with \nAA eventually helped him to accept that he is an alcoholic. He has fully applied himself to \nthe AA program. He attends meetings regularly, goes on commitments frequently, works \nthe 12-step program, has a six-year relationship with his sponsor, and even sponsors two \nAA members. Consistent with the AA program, Applicant intends not to consume any \nalcohol in the future, and there is no evidence of a relapse after he fully committed himself \nto his recovery. His ongoing affiliation with AA is evidence of actions taken to overcome his \ndiagnosed alcohol dependency problem. Yet, for AG \u00b6 23(b) to apply, the abstinence must \nbe for sufficient time to clearly establish that Applicant\u201fs trustworthiness and reliability are \nnot subject to question. See ISCR Case No. 06-08708 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007). While \nApplicant maintained abstinence for longer in the past (from May 1987 to around 1995) \nthan his present six years, he did not have the support network in AA that he has had for at \nleast the past four years. Largely because of the strength of his commitment to AA, as \nconfirmed by both his AA sponsor (Ex. E), and the testimony of a fellow AA member (Tr. \n114-19), his six years of abstinence is sufficient to apply AG \u00b6 23(b). \n \n \nDespite an assessed high risk of recidivism, Applicant was considered to have \nsuccessfully completed the 14-day inpatient court-mandated DUIL program in December \n2005. By October 2010, he had fulfilled his sentence to where he was no longer on \nprobation for his December 2004 OUI. With his six years of established abstinence and \nactive affiliation with AA on a regular basis, Applicant had satisfied the treatment, \nabstinence, and self-help components of AG \u00b6 23(d) as of his December 2010 hearing on \nhis clearance eligibility, and was lacking only the favorable prognosis required. See AG \u00b6 \n23(d) (stating, \u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling \nor rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program\u201d). On January 2, 2011, an experienced LADC rendered his \nprofessional opinion that Applicant\u201fs alcohol dependence was in full, sustained remission. \nHe assessed Applicant\u201fs prognosis for continued sobriety as \u201chighly favorable,\u201d in \nsignificant part because of Applicant\u201fs dedication to AA. This clinician\u201fs curriculum vitae \nwas not provided, but his listed credentials show he is qualified to make a substance abuse \nprognosis. AG \u00b6 23(d) is also implicated. \n \n \nSatisfaction of any or all of the pertinent mitigating conditions is not outcome \ndeterminative, and Applicant\u201fs record of repeated drunk-driving offenses is not easily \novercome. That said, while not a recognized professional alcohol treatment program, AA \nappears to have given Applicant the support he needs to maintain sobriety, and perhaps \n\n \n \n11 \nmore importantly, an outlet to address the emotional issues of the childhood sexual abuse, \nthe unfair settlement of his accident claim, and his spouse\u201fs cancer diagnoses. In the \nopinions of his sponsor, another AA attendee, and the LADC, who evaluated him in mid to \nlate December 2010, Applicant has made the necessary changes in his attitude and \nlifestyle to sustain his sobriety. The Alcohol Consumption concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u201fs eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u201fs age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant held a confidential-level security \nclearance without any adverse incidents when he was actively abusing alcohol. While this \ndoes not compel a favorable outcome, he is seen as less of a security risk now, given his \nsustained commitment to his recovery through his active involvement in AA since June \n2006. He has regular contact with his sponsor and others in AA, who will continue to \nsupport him. Based on the evidence before me, it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u201fs security clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \n\n \n \n12 \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 42-year-old high school graduate who worked as a spray painter in a shipyard for over 23 years. He held a security clearance for over 15 years. He has four children, one living at home, one living with her mother for whom he pays child support, and two no longer at home. He is married and his wife is also employed at the shipyard. However, she is now on sick leave because of an injury. He and his wife are required to maintain separate households because of family matters even though they are married. Prior to his marriage, Applicant was a single parent raising the one daughter that lived with him. During this time, he also had to care for his elderly and sick parents. Applicant's monthly pay is between $2,400 and $3,400 depending on the amount of overtime he works. His monthly expenses are about $2,400, leaving him with discretionary or disposable funding dependent on his overtime pay. While his wife has monthly income of about $1,600, since she is maintaining her own household, these funds were not counted in Applicant's income (Tr. 33-36, 45-52; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated July 3, 2007; Gov. Ex. 3, Answer to Interrogatory, dated May 30, 2008). Applicant submitted a security clearance application in July 2007 to update his security clearance. In response to question 28(a) asking if in the last seven years he had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts, Applicant answered \"NO\". Applicant was given the security clearance application at work",

On July 9, 2008, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for \nApplicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations under Guideline F and \npersonal conduct under Guideline E.  The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 19, 2008. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 8, 2008.  He admitted all of \nthe allegations under Guideline F with some explanations, but denied that he \nintentionally falsified his security clearance application as alleged under Guideline E.  \nHe requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on October 27, 2008, and the case was assigned to me that day.  \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 18, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 3, 2008, scheduling a hearing for \nNovember 20, 2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered six \nexhibits, marked government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6, which were received \nwithout objection.  Applicant submitted four documents, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. \nEx.) A-D, which were received without objection.  Applicant and one witness testified on \nhis behalf.  The record was left open for Applicant to submit additional documents.  \nApplicant timely submitted four additional documents marked App. Ex. E-H.  The \ngovernment did not object to the admission of the documents (See Gov. Ex. 7, \nDepartment Counsel Letter, dated December 10, 2008), and the documents are \nadmitted into the record.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nDecember 2, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR paragraph 1.n to reflect that the debt \nis a delinquent debt and not a judgment.  Since, the debt was not a judgment, \nDepartment Counsel moved to delete SOR allegation 2.a.  SOR 1.n was amended and \na finding \"For Applicant\" was entered for SOR allegation 2.a. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old high school graduate who worked as a spray painter in \na shipyard for over 23 years.  He held a security clearance for over 15 years.  He has \nfour children, one living at home, one living with her mother for whom he pays child \nsupport, and two no longer at home.  He is married and his wife is also employed at the \nshipyard.  However, she is now on sick leave because of an injury.  He and his wife are \nrequired to maintain separate households because of family matters even though they \nare married.  Prior to his marriage, Applicant was a single parent raising the one \ndaughter that lived with him.  During this time, he also had to care for his elderly and \nsick parents.  Applicant's monthly pay is between $2,400 and $3,400 depending on the \namount of overtime he works.  His monthly expenses are about $2,400, leaving him with \ndiscretionary or disposable funding dependent on his overtime pay.  While his wife has \nmonthly income of about $1,600, since she is maintaining her own household, these \nfunds were not counted in Applicant's income (Tr. 33-36, 45-52; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, \ndated July 3, 2007; Gov. Ex. 3, Answer to Interrogatory, dated May 30, 2008). \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application in July 2007 to update his \nsecurity clearance.  In response to question 28(a) asking if in the last seven years he \nhad been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts, Applicant answered \"NO\".  \nApplicant was given the security clearance application at work to complete at home.  He \nand his wife spent a few nights after work completing the form.  He did not know at the \ntime he had debts that were more than 180 days delinquent since he had not seen his \ncredit report.  He had not purchased much in his life since he had to raise his children.  \nHe was making payments to the Internal Revenue Service on a tax debt so he did not \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbelieve that the debt was past due.  He did know that his wages were garnished to pay \na debt (Tr. 41-45; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated July 3, 2007). \n \nCredit reports show and Applicant admits that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nin April 1990 and the debts were discharged in August 1990 (SOR 1.r; Gov. Ex. 6, \nBankruptcy documents, August 1990).  Credit reports show and Applicant admits he \nhas the following 17 delinquent debts.  Thirteen of the debts are small medical debts in \ncollection including two for $25 (SOR 1.a and 1.b); five for $50 (SOR 1.c, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, \nand 1.m); one for $556 (SOR 1.d); one at $162 (SOR 1.e); one at $195 (SOR 1.f); one \nat $89 (SOR 1.h); one at $97 (SOR 1.k); and one at $34 (SOR 1.l).  There is also a \ndelinquent cell phone debt in collection for $191 (SOR 1.n); a federal tax lien for \n$15,895 (SOR 1.o); a credit card debt in collection for $1,684 (SOR 1.p); and another \ncredit card in collection for $2,195 (SOR 1.q); See Gov. Ex. 2, Credit Report, dated \nAugust 29, 2007; Gov. Ex. 4, Credit Report, dated June 16, 2008; Gov. Ex. 5, Credit \nReport, date September 22, 2008;  \n \nApplicant used a recent credit report to determine the creditors for his delinquent \ndebts and the status of those debts (Tr. 30-32; App. Ex. D, Credit Report, dated October \n27, 2008).  The medical delinquent debts are for co-pays from Applicant receiving \nmedical treatment.  All of the medical co-pay debts were paid by Applicant after he \nlearned of them from the SOR (Tr. 22-26; App; Ex. A, 11 money orders, various dates; \nApp. Ex. C, four money orders, various dates).  SOR allegation 1.n for a cell phone has \nbeen paid in full (Tr. 24-26; App. Ex. B, Receipt, dated November 14, 2008).  Applicant \nis making payments on his credit card debt of $1,684.  His latest payment was returned \nby the creditor for insufficient account information for processing the payment (Tr. 29; \nApp. Ex. C, Money Order, undated; App. Ex. Letter, dated December 1, 2008).  \nApplicant is also making payments on his credit card debt of $2,195 (Tr. 29-30; App. Ex. \nG, Letter, dated December 3, 2008).  \n \nApplicant did not file his federal income taxes for three years because he did not \nhave dependents to claim since his children did not live with him, he was laid off when \nthe shipyard had a strike so he was short of funds, and he was caring for his family and \nparents.  He has filed his returns and has a payment plan with the IRS to pay his past \ndue taxes.  He has been paying the IRS $150 a month on his taxes since 1998.  He is \ncurrent with his payments (Tr. 26-29; App. Ex. E, IRS Monthly Statement, dated \nNovember 12, 2008). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  The delinquent debts that Applicant admits and are listed in credit reports \nare a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \n\u00b6 19(a) \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\", and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\".  Applicant accumulated delinquent debts for medical \npayments, a tax lien, and credit cards because he had difficulty meeting his financial \nobligations as a single parent.  Applicant credibly testified concerning his financial \nsituation.  Through his testimony, Applicant showed he was unsophisticated in financial \nmatters but was responsible in attempting to manage his finances under the \ncircumstances.  The bankruptcy action was filed over 18 years ago.  Bankruptcy is a \nlegal and permissible means of resolving debts.  Since the bankruptcy was so long ago, \nit is no longer a factor to consider in Applicant's financial situation. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\", and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\"  Applicant incurred a number of small medical co-pay debts \nbecause he did not pay sufficient attention to the requirement to make the co-pays for \nmedical treatment for himself.  He was also struggling with being a single parent and \ncaring for his sick and elderly parents.  When he received the SOR and understood the \nextent of his medical debts, he immediately took steps to pay all of them.  He has a \nfederal tax lien but he has been making payments on his taxes according to an \nagreement with the IRS since 1998.  He is also making payments on his two credit card \ndebts.  Of the 17 debts, fourteen have been paid, and three are being paid according to \npayment plans.  Since some debts are still being paid and the other debts were only \npaid recently, his debts are considered current.  Applicant had delinquent debts but has \npaid or is paying them.  He is solidly employed in the shipyard and his debts are under \ncontrol.  His financial problems should not recur.   \n \n \nI also considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\" applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded.  Applicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay \nthem, and has shown a good-faith effort to pay them.  Applicant paid 14 of the 17 \ndelinquent debts listed.  He has payment plans on the remaining three debts and is \ncurrent with his payments.  Applicant acted responsibly towards his debts, and \n\n \n6 \n \n \nestablished his good-faith efforts to resolve his debts.  He mitigated security concerns \nraised by his financial situation. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s incomplete answers on his \nsecurity clearance application concerning financial issues of judgments and past due \ndebts raises a security concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC \nDC) AG \u00b6 16(a) \"the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and \nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness\". \n \n \nApplicant denied intentional falsification.  He responded to the financial questions \non the application as best he could.  He knew of a garnishment and he listed that on the \napplication.  He did not know of the small medical debts for co-pays so they were not \nlisted.  He was making payments on other debts and did not think he was over 180 past \ndue on the debts.  Applicant is unsophisticated in financial matters and completed the \nsecurity clearance application to the best of his knowledge.  While there is a security \nconcern for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \ndocument or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance, \nevery omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is not a falsification.  The \nfalsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and \nwillfully.  Since Applicant listed the financial concerns as he knew them when \ncompleting the application, his failure to list all the delinquent debts was not knowing \nand willful.  Applicant established he did not deliberately provide false information on the \nsecurity clearance application with intent to deceive.  I find for Appellant as to Personal \nConduct.   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant's 23 years of \nservice in the shipyard and that he has held a security clearance for about 15 years.  He \nacknowledges his legal obligation to pay his outstanding debts.  Applicant is not \nsophisticated financially but he took immediate action when advised of his delinquent \ndebts.  He had been paying the IRS tax debt.  He paid all of the small medical co-pays.  \nHe is making payments on his two credit card debts.  Applicant lives within his means \nand meets his personal financial obligations.  His actions do not indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment irresponsibility, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations.  He is not financially overextended, and his finances do not create a \nsecurity concern.  He did not provide incomplete information on his security clearance \napplication with the intent to deceive.  He provided the information to the best of his \nknowledge.  Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with no questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.r:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 16, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\n\n2\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 12, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains no substantive matters and makes no assertion of harmful\nerror on the part of the Judge.  The Appeal Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to cases in\nwhich the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.\nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s appeal submission makes reference to matters that were not part of the\nrecord below.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nTherefore, the decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: William S. Fields             \nWilliam S.

However, the posture of the case is somewhat unusual, and I am not\nsanguine about affirming the result without comment.  The SOR alleged only two delinquent debts\nin excess of $1,000: one for about $4,000 and one for about $14,000.  Applicant was pro se and\nclearly not familiar with legal procedures.  She reported at the hearing that the alleged $14,000 was\nnot a debt and was just an error.  She did not bring any corroboration to the hearing.  The Judge left\nthe record open but Applicant did not supply the corroboration by the close of the record.\nAccordingly, the Judge, in her Whole Person Analysis focused on the absence of corroboration for\nApplicant\u2019s claims on her largest debt \u201crepresenting 65% of her listed debts\u201d (Decision page 8) and\nreached an adverse result.\nOn appeal Applicant reports that she sought corroboration before close of the record but that\nit did not arrive until after the close of the record (although before the Judge issued her decision).\nIf Applicant\u2019s corroboration would really support her claim, then I am not sure that her actual\ndelinquent debts would have raised security concerns, and I suspect the Judge might have analyzed\nthe case differently.\n\n3\nSigned: Michael Y.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nJanuary 12, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 16, 2009, and requested a \nhearing. On September 10, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me. On September 21, \n2009, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing, setting the case for October 14, 2009. The \ncase was heard as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 \ninto evidence without objection. Applicant testified, but did not provide any documentary \nevidence. The record remained open until October 29, 2009, to give Applicant an \nopportunity to submit information pertinent to the delinquent debts listed in the SOR. \nShe timely submitted documents that were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through \n5 and admitted into the record without objection from Department Counsel.  DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on October 21, 2009.                                                     \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.e, and 1.i. She denied the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, \nand 2.a.1  \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. She has two children, ages 21 and 15. She graduated \nfrom a state university with a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work in 1994, after which she \nworked at the university for two-and-a-half years. In September 1997, she enlisted in \nthe Army and was on active duty until November 2000, when she became an active \nreservist. In August 2005, she was honorably discharged in the pay grade of E-4. (Tr. \n20-21.) She had a security clearance while in the Army. \n \n \nAfter leaving active duty, Applicant was unemployed from August 2000 until \nDecember 2000, when she secured work with a telephone company. She worked there \nuntil August 2001, when she lost her position. She remained unemployed until February \n2002, when she obtained a position with a defense contractor. She continued working \nfor that contractor until January 2007. She was then unemployed from February 2007 \nthrough March 2007, at which time she obtained another contractor position that she \nhad for two months. In June 2007, she obtained her current position as a technical \ninstaller of communications equipment in military vehicles. From March 2001 to \nFebruary 2002, she attended cosmetology school and received unemployment benefits. \n(GE 1.) She attributed some of her financial problems to those periods of unemployment \nand the lack of sufficient child support. In 2004, the father of one of her children was \nkilled in an accident. Subsequently, she receives a small amount of social security \npayments for her son. The father of the other child sporadically gave her very small \namounts of money over the years. (Tr. 42.)   \n \n \n \nIn September 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator after \ncompleting a security clearance application. During the interview, she responded to \nquestions about the delinquent debts noted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j. \n                                            \n1Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR \u00b6 2.a is not attached to the written Answer she submitted. \nShe denied the allegation on the record. (Tr. 34.)  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nShe stated it was her intention to pay the bills, but that she did not have sufficient \nmoney to do so. (GE 5.)   \n \n \nIn July 2007, Applicant completed another SF 86. In response to \u201cSection 28. \nFinancial Delinquencies: Your Financial Delinquencies: a. In the last 7 years, have you \nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s),\u201d and \u201cSection 28: b. Are you currently \nover 90 days delinquent on any debts(s),\u201d she answered \u201cno,\u201d and failed to list the 10 \ndelinquent debts listed in the SOR. At the time, she did not know the status of her old \ndelinquent debts and did not have a credit bureau report in front of her. She knew that \nher current bills were not delinquent, so she did not think she had delinquent debts or \nfinancial problems. (Tr. 46.) Additionally, she was applying for a mortgage and did not \nreceive notice or any indication from her realtor that she had a credit problem. (Tr. 47.) \nShe denied that she intentionally falsified the SF 86. (Tr. 35.) She credibly asserted she \nmade an honest mistake. (Tr. 45.) \n \n \nIn August 2008, Applicant responded to the government\u2019s interrogatories about \nher delinquent debts, including nine of those subsequently listed in the SOR. She \nexplained that the debts \u201chave either been charged off, paid, or in the old uncollected \n[sic] debts.\u201d (GE 2.) She claimed that \u201cThe only current bills that should be on my up to \ndate credit report should be student loans and the debts I have listed on the monthly \nincome sheets.\u201d (GE 2.) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated February 26, 2009, and August 3, \n2007, the June 2009 SOR alleged security concerns based on the accumulation of ten \ndelinquent debts totaling $20,981. The status of each of those debts is as follows:  \n \n  \n1. (\u00b6 1.a) This $987 medical debt is owed to a hospital for a visit relating to her \nyoung son in October 2002 when he broke his arm. Public aid sent a check \nfor more than the amount owed and the hospital would not accept the check. \nThe debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 27; 47-48.) \n \n2. (\u00b6 1.b) This $423 debt is owed to a cellular telephone company. Applicant \ndenies that she ever used this company. (Tr. 28.) She said she would dispute \nthe debt after the hearing. She did not subsequently submit any evidence that \nshe did so. The debt became delinquent in May 2002 and is unresolved. (GE \n4.) \n \n3. (\u00b6 1.c.) The $180 student loan debt is paid. (AE 3.)  \n \n4. (\u00b6 1.d) Applicant claimed that the $14,088 debt owed to an automobile \ncompany was paid. She asserted that her insurance company issued a check \nfor all but $355 of the debt. She submitted evidence that she paid the $355 in \n2005 (AE 4), but did not provide evidence that the larger portion of the debt \nwas paid by the insurance company and is resolved. (Tr. 30; 48.) The debt \nappears on the February 2009 CBR, indicating that it is unresolved. (GE 3.) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n5. (\u00b6 1.e) The $3,945 debt owed to a credit card company is unresolved. It \nbecame due in July 2007. She believes most of the reported amount is for \ninterest and penalties charges that she cannot afford. (Tr. 31; 49.) She has \nnot contacted the creditor.  \n \n6. (\u00b6 1. f) Applicant thinks the $407 debt is for medical services her son received \nin February 2002. She is not certain. She has not contacted the creditor to \nwork out a resolution. It is unresolved. (Tr. 51-52; GE 4.) \n \n7. (\u00b6 1.g) Applicant is unfamiliar with the $109 debt owed to her current cellular \ntelephone company. It became delinquent in July 2007. (Tr. 32; GE 4.) It is \nunresolved. \n \n8. (\u00b6 1.h) This $482 debt is owed to the landlord of an apartment complex where \nshe lived. It became due in August 2001. She claims she does not owe the \ndebt, but has not taken any action to formally dispute or resolve it. (Tr. 33; GE \n4.) \n \n9. (\u00b6 1.i) This $286 debt is a medical bill owed for her son\u2019s care. It became \ndelinquent in July 2002. It is unresolved. (Tr. 33; GE 2).   \n \n10.  (\u00b6 1.j) This $74 debt is owed to her current cellular company. She is \nunfamiliar with it. It became delinquent in March 2003. (Tr. 33; GE 2.) It is \nunresolved. \n \n \nApplicant submitted copies of 13 checks, totaling $8,153, which she has issued \nto creditors. (AE 4.) It is not clear to whom the checks were written, when they were \nwritten, and to which SOR debts they pertain, other than one regarding the automobile \ndebt. In summary, her student loan is paid, she paid at least $355 on the automobile \nloan, and the other eight debts are unresolved. She admitted that she did not review the \ncredit reports she received from Department Counsel as part of the discovery materials \nprior to her hearing. (Tr. 55.) She has not obtained financial counseling. (Tr. 61.)  \n \n \nApplicant provided a copy of her budget. Her net monthly income is $2,923 and \nexpenses are $2,482, including payments on a credit card, car loan, and a personal \nloan. She has approximately $400 at the end of the month for other expenses. (AE 5) \nShe stated that all of her bills are current. (Tr. 58.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC), which are \nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n \n \n \n6\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies that \nbegan in August 2001, continued into July 2007, and essentially remain unpaid or \nunresolved at the present. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions.  \nAG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s problems are ongoing and did \nnot occur under circumstances that were so unusual and unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(b) \nhas limited application There is some evidence that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \naccrued as a result of periods of unemployment over the course of the last seven years \nand insufficient child support; however, there is no evidence that she attempted to \nresponsibly resolve or manage her problems during those times, which is necessary for \nfull application of this mitigating condition. Applicant has not obtained credit counseling \nor presented sufficient evidence to indicate that her delinquent debts are under control, \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nas required under AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant provided proof that she paid her student loan, \ndemonstrating a good-faith effort to pay that delinquent debt and warranting the \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(d) to it. Although she repeatedly claimed that she disputes many \nof the debts, she never took any affirmative steps to formally dispute the debts with the \nreporting credit bureaus, which is necessary to warrant the application of AG \u00b6 20(e). \nThere is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(f).     \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant falsified answers to a \nquestion on her SF 86, regarding disclosure of debts more than 90 or 180 days \ndelinquent. The government contended that her omissions may raise a security concern \nand be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16(a):  \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that she intentionally omitted information about the delinquent \ndebts. When a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the \nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining \nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n \nBecause her current bills were paid and she did not have a CBR in front of her \nwhen she completed the SF 86, Applicant did not think that she had financial problems. \nShe acknowledged that she made a mistake by not listing her old debts that were on \nher credit report. After listening to her testimony on this issue, I find that the omission of \nthe information was likely negligent, but not intentional. Hence, the evidence does not \nestablish deliberate falsification.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 40-year-old educated \nwoman, who served in the military for eight years and subsequently worked for a \ndefense contractor for almost eight years. Over the course of the last ten years, she has \nexperienced periods of unemployment and limited child support, which have created \nsome financial hardships for her as a single parent. She appears to be dedicated to her \njob and has performed satisfactorily for her current employer.  \n \nIn September 2004, the government notified Applicant that certain delinquent \ndebts were creating security concerns. In August 2008, the government again notified \nher of its concerns. In June 2009, she received the SOR, setting forth delinquent debts \nthat have raised a concern for at least five years. At the hearing, she strongly contended \nthat she paid and resolved the largest debt listed in the SOR and agreed to supply \nproof. At the conclusion of the hearing, the record remained open for more than two \nweeks to give her an opportunity to submit evidence in support of her appeal. Despite \nher consistent statements that the car loan had been resolved since 2005, she did not \nprovide proof (other than a $355 payment) that the $14,088 debt, representing 65% of \nthe listed debts, was resolved.  \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude there is sufficient evidence to raise a security concern under Guideline F, and \nthat Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  For the reasons stated above, Guideline E is found for the Applicant. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Twelve of the debts have not been paid nor is there an \narrangement paying these debts. Applicant mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcerns, but failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility \nto access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn September 6, 2007, Applicant submitted his Questionnaires for Public Trust \nPosition (SF 85P). On July 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, based on a history of financial problems as \nevicenced by delinquent debts and Guideline E, personal conduct, for falsified material \non his SF 85P. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \n \n \n \n1\nNovember 10, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended \n(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nOn August 21, 2008, Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was received in which \nApplicant requested a hearing and provided nine attachments listed as Exhibits A \nthrough I to his answer. On September 22, 2008, I was assigned the case. On October \n7, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on October 16, \n2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 7, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibit A, which was \nadmitted into evidence. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional matters. On October 27, 2008, additional documents were received. There \nbeing no objection, the material was admitted into evidence as Ex. B. On October 24, \n2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.p, \nand 2.c of the SOR. He neither admitted nor denied SOR \u00b6 2.b. He admitted the \nremaining factual allegations of the SOR. He admits owing more than $15,000 on 12 \ndebts. (Tr. 19) Applicant also provided additional information with his answer to the \nSOR to support his request for eligibility for access to sensitive information. There being \nno objection, the additional material was admitted into the record and referred to \nhereafter as \u201cAnswer Ex.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old health program policy analyst who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since September 2007, and is seeking to obtain accesses to \nsensitive information. (Ex. 1) Applicant maintains two jobs. He teaches medical \nassisting at night and is paid $23 per hour, which generates $15,000 to $16,000 per \nyear. (Tr. 41) In October 2008, Applicant was offered a new job paying $85,000. (Ex. A) \n \nApplicant was trained in the Air Force as a medical technician. (Tr. 42) Applicant \nwas in the Air Force ten years and ten months, from January 1990 to January 2001. (Tr. \n42, Ex. 1) Applicant received an honorable discharge and left as a staff sergeant, pay \ngrade E-5. (Tr. 42, Ex. 6)  \n \n \nIn August 2000, a paternity test determined Applicant was not the father of one of \nhis wife\u2019s children. (Answer Ex. B) In March 2003, Applicant and his wife separated. \n(Answer Ex. A) In June 2003, a temporary protective order was issued against \nApplicant. (Answer Ex. G, I) From the time of separation and the divorce date, Applicant \ndid not know his wife\u2019s location. (Tr. 52) Applicant has not seen his ex-wife since July \n2006. (Tr. 53) In February 2004, at the time of the divorce decree, Applicant learned his \n\n \n \n \n3\nwife had obtained a $922 monthly child support obligation and that he owed $19,000 in \npast due child support. (Tr. 53, 56)  \n \nApplicant agreed to the support obligation in hopes he would be allowed to see \nhis child. (Tr. 53) In hindsight, it was a bad decision because Applicant has yet to see \nhis child. The balance of the arrearage occurred when Applicant was out of work due to \nillness. (Tr. 54) Applicant received partial disability from April 2005 to mid July 2005, \nwhich paid 60% of his income. (Tr. 57, 60) He was also unemployed from January 2006 \nto March 2006. (Tr. 57, 61) Prior to his unemployment he was making $55,000 a year. \n(Tr. 62)  \n \nApplicant had difficulty serving his ex-wife in his attempt to have his child support \nlowered. (Tr. 64) In June 2007, the child support was $560 per month with an additional \n$100 per month to pay the arrearage. (Tr. 31) In April 2008, Applicant returned to court \nand discovered he was approximately $26,000 in arrears on his child support (Tr. 54, \nSOR \u00b6 1.q, $26,267, which is the same debt as SOR \u00b6 1.g, $20,696). Applicant pays \n$304 child support every two weeks for his one child of the marriage. (Tr. 31, 51, Ex. B) \nApplicant is current on his monthly child support payment, which includes payment on \nthe arrearage. Payment is automatically deducted from his checking account. (Tr. 32, \nEx. B) \n \nIn 2003, Applicant bought a Nissan, which was repossessed in 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c, \n$6,475, Tr. 73) Applicant owes: a $1,400 telephone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.b, Tr. 72); a $1,717 \ncredit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e, Tr. 75); a $1,670 doctor\u2019s bill (SOR \u00b6 1. f, Tr. 75); three \nmedical debts $196 (SOR \u00b6 1. h), $435 (SOR \u00b6 1.i), and $457 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); a $59 utility \ngas bill (SOR \u00b6 1.k); a $1,162 hospital bill (SOR \u00b6 1.l); and two telephone bills of $267 \n(SOR \u00b6 1. n) and $77 (SOR \u00b6 1. o).  \n \nIn 2004, Applicant returned to school securing his bachelor\u2019s degree in health \ncare management. Applicant is paying his student loans by automatic deduction from \nhis bank account. Monthly, he pays $112 on one loan and $208 on the other. (Tr. 79) \nWhile in school, Applicant was overpaid $896 by the Veteran Administration (VA). This \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1. m) is paid each month by a $100 automatic deduction from Applicant\u2019s \nbank account. (Tr. 45) Applicant owed a $200 traffic ticket (SOR \u00b6 1. p), which was paid \nfollowing the hearing. (Ex. B)  \n \n \nIn March 2005, Applicant was evaluated for memory loss, change in speech \npattern, and fainting. (Answer Ex. E) Applicant learned he suffered from partial complex \nseizures. (Answer Ex. C) In 2005, Applicant suffered his last seizure. (Tr. 36) In May \n2005, Applicant\u2019s doctor stated Applicant was suffering from a generalized anxiety \ndisorder. He was suffering numbness, tingling in his hands and feet, generalized \nweakness, lightheadedness, and headaches. (Tr. 34) Applicant was treated long term \nfor depression. (Answer Ex. E) Applicant has been on medication for the last four years \nand his depression is under control. (Tr. 33) \n \n\n \n \n \n4\n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Questionnaires for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) dated \nSeptember 6, 2007, Applicant failed to list a state tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.a, $547, Ex. 3). \nApplicant was unaware of the tax lien four months after it was issued when he \ncompleted his SF 85P. (Tr. 36, 39) On his federal tax return, Applicant claimed as a \ndependant a woman with whom he lived. (Tr. 38, 66-67) The lien came about when the \ndeduction was disallowed. In July 2005, Applicant and the woman married. (Tr. 68) \nApplicant received notice he owed some $500, which his wife said she would pay. (Tr. \n68) Applicant does not remember receiving any notice or paperwork concerning the tax \nlien before the lien was issued. (Tr. 39, 70) Applicant has made a $50 payment on the \ntax debt. (Tr. 49) \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant entered into an agreement with a financial counseling \nfirm or credit management agency. (Answer Ex. F) The financial service is to negotiate \nwith creditors to pay Applicant\u2019s debts and have them removed from his credit report. \nApplicant went to the service intending to clean up his credit. (Tr. 45) The agreement \nwill address eight debts totaling $17,351. Once the service is paid a $2,500 fee, the \nservice will start negotiating with Applicant\u2019s creditors concerning the debts. (Tr. 48, 49)  \n \nThe financial service fee is to be paid by monthly electronic payments. (Ex. B) \nFor three months, from April 2008 to June 2008, Applicant was to pay the service $330 \neach month for a total of $990, which he has done. For the next 12 months, from July \n2008 through June 2009, Applicant is to pay the service $131.55 per month for a total of \n$1,578. Starting in July 2008, Applicant was to save $198.45 each month in order to \nhave a fund of money from which offers will be made to negotiate payment to his \ncreditors. (Ex. B, Tr. 48) The service has yet to negotiate with a creditor or make any \ntype of payment. Once paid in June 2009, the financial service will start negotiations.  \n \nApplicant has not paid the small debts listed in the SOR because he is paying the \nservice to negotiate on his behalf. (Tr. 78) Seven of Applicant\u2019s debts were under $500 \neach, of which, three are under $200 each. \n \nIn response to the March 2008 written interrogatories, (Ex 6) Applicant submitted \na personal financial statement showing a gross salary of $5,000 and a monthly net \nremainder (income less expenses and deductions) of $1,354. (Ex. 6) Applicant provides \nfinancial support to his mother, grandmother, and his sister who has two children. (Tr. \n83-84). He also helps his brother. (Tr. 87) Applicant plans to be debt free in a year and \na half. (Tr. 84) Applicant contributes $76 every two weeks to his 401(k) retirement plan, \nthe balance of which is not part of the record. (Ex. B)  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for . \n. . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \n\n \n \n \n5\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n \n \n6\n                                                          \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with eligibility for access to sensitive information. An applicant is not \nrequired to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his \nfinancial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owed approximately $42,000 on 15 past due obligations.1 \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit report, his SOR \nresponse, his response to interrogatories, and his testimony. Throughout this process, \nhe admitted responsibility for all but three delinquent debs. His child support obligation \nwas listed twice (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. g and 1. q) and he denied the $200 traffic ticket (SOR \u00b6 1. \np). Applicant has provided insufficient documentation to show significant progress \nresolving his debts. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n \n1 The SOR fails to list an allegation in SOR \u00b6 1. d. \n\n \n \n \n7\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApproximately half of Applicant\u2019s debt ($26,278 of $41,828) relates to Applicant\u2019s  \nchild support arrearage. The arrearage was incurred between the time of his separation \nand divorce from his now ex-wife. Applicant agreed to the monthly child support \nobligation in a mistaken belief that if he agreed to the amount his ex-wife would allow \nhim visitation with his child. His child support obligation is automatically deducted from \nhis pay, but his ex-wife has continued in her refusal to allow him to see his child. He is \npaying $100 monthly to the VA on an overpayment he received while he was a student. \nHowever, there are 12 additional debts totaling approximately $14,000 that remain \nunpaid.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s medical problems caused him to receive partial disability payments \nfrom April 2005 to mid July 2005, which paid 60% of his income. He was unemployed \nthe first three months of 2006. Additionally, Applicant provides support to his mother, \nsister, grandmother, and brother.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to the 12 debts. They did not happen long ago, they \nare not infrequent, and were not incurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. The debts include medical bills, a utility bill, telephone bills, a credit card debt, \nand the 2004 vehicle repossession. No payments have been made on these debts.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant experienced both separation and divorce along with \nthe financial burden associated with each and medical problems. AG & 20(b) partially \napplies because these are problems beyond his control, but by making no payment on \n\n \n \n \n8\nthe 12 delinquent debts since he returned to full-time employment he has failed to act \nresponsibly as to these debts. Three of the debts are under two hundred dollars and \nfour more are under $500 each.  \n \nThere is no indication Applicant received counseling for the problem nor is there \na clear indication the problem is being resolved or is under control. Although no \npayments are being made on the 12 debts, Applicant hopes to be debt free in a year \nand a half. AG & 20(c) does not apply. \n \nApplicant has paid a traffic ticket and is making payments on his VA debt and on \nhis child support obligation. & 20(d) applies to these three debts because Applicant has \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay these overdue creditors or otherwise resolve the \ndebts. The other debts are being handled by a finance service. Once the finance service \nhas received its $2,500 fee, scheduled to be June 2009, it will start negotiating \nsettlement on Applicant\u2019s debts using money Applicant is to have saved. However, \nstarting in July 2008, Applicant was to save $198.45 monthly in order to have money \nwhen the service negotiated settlements on his debts. Applicant has not saved any of \nthe required money. There is no good-faith effort to repay the 12 overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve these debts.  \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nThe Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant=s personal conduct \nthat may be potentially disqualifying. Paragraph 15 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nstates a concern where there is conduct \u201cinvolving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the eligibility for access to sensitive information process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the eligibility for access to sensitive information process.\u201d \n \nIn June 2003, Applicant\u2019s now ex-wife requested and was granted a protective \norder. This accompanied a period of separation prior to their divorce. His ex-wife\u2018s \nconduct may have been influenced by Applicant\u2019s learning he was not the father of a \nchild he believed was his. His ex-wife has acted in such a way to prevent Applicant from \nexercising his court ordered visitation. There is nothing in the record showing the \nissuance of this protective order or the factors leading to its issuance that would \nadversely reflect on Applicant\u2019s security worthiness.  \n \nApplicant incurred an arrearage for child support. Between the time of their \nseparation and divorce, Applicant did not know his now ex-wife\u2019s location and she \nprevented him from seeing his child. He was unaware of the child support obligation \nuntil the time of the divorce. He agreed to the monthly child support payments in a \nmistaken belief that paying the amount would assure him visitation with his child. He \nwas wrong. He is paying his child support obligation and making payment on the \n\n \n \n \n9\narrearage. Neither the child support obligation nor the arrearage adversely reflects on \nApplicant\u2019s security worthiness.  \n \nUnder AG & 16 (a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine eligibility for access to sensitive information eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d and & 16 (b) \u201cdeliberately providing \nfalse or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity \nofficial, \ncompetent \nmedical \nauthority, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative\u201d are security concerns. \n \nApplicant failed to list a tax lien on his SF 85P. Applicant knew tax was owed, \nand thought his girlfriend, later to be his wife, paid the tax debt once they were notified \nof the delinquency. It was only after completing his SF 85 P that he learned a tax lien \nhad been issued four months before he completed the form.  \n \n \nThe Government has shown Applicant failed to list his tax lien, but this does not \nprove the Applicant deliberately failed to disclose information about the lien. Applicant \nhas denied intentional falsification. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \na material fact in any written document or oral statement to the Government when \napplying for eligibility for access to sensitive information is a security concern. But every \ninaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification must be deliberate and \nmaterial. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. An omission concerning a \ntax lien is not deliberate if the person did not know it existed. When Applicant completed \nhis SF 85P he was unaware of the lien.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the \ntotality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \neligibility for access to sensitive information must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n\n \n \n \n10\n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The majority of the debts incurred \nwere not the type that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations. Six of the debts set forth in the SOR were not incurred \non luxuries, but were for medical treatment and taxes. This cannot be said of the credit \ncard debt (SOR & 1. e, $1,717) or the delinquent telephone debts (SOR & 1. e, $1,403; \nSOR & 1. n, $267; or, SOR & 1. o, $77).  \n \nThe issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid\u2014it is whether his financial \ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to have access to sensitive information. \n(See AG & 2(a) (1).) Applicant has not addressed 12 of his delinquent debts and it \nappears no payment will be made on any of these debts until after June 2009. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for access to sensitive information. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof access to sensitive information. The awarding of access to sensitive information is \nnot a once in a life time occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both \ndisqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn April 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nF, financial considerations, and E, personal conduct. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR, admitting SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d,\nand denying the remainder. He requested an administrative determination. On\nNovember 6, 2008, department counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM).\nIn the FORM, department counsel withdrew the personal conduct guideline allegations.\nFebruary 17, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant did not reply to the FORM. On January 21, 2009, the case was\nassigned to me. I have reviewed the FORM and have concluded that it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information.\nClearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 36-year-old single man with no children. An earlier marriage ended\nin divorce 11 years ago. He has a high school degree, and served in the U.S. Army from\n1993 to 2000. His discharge was honorable. The record contains no job description.\nThe SOR lists six delinquent debts in the approximate amount of $13,000. SOR\nsubparagraph 1.a is a $2,180 credit card bill. A judgment was entered on this account in\n2003 (Item 4). Applicant asserts that he has been paying $15 per week toward its\nsatisfaction, consistent with the court order (Item 6 at 5). He provided no supporting\ndocumentary evidence. \nSOR subparagraph 1.b is a $150 tax lien that the state department of motor\nvehicles filed against his property in 1995. He satisfied it in 1997 (Item 4 at 4).\nSOR subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d are delinquent credit card accounts equal to\n$7,550 and $2,540, respectively. He has not contacted these creditors, and intends to\nsatisfy them one at a time (Item 6 at 5). In February 2008, he satisfied an unlisted\ndelinquency through monthly payments of approximately $525 (Item 6 at 11). \nThe creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.e is a collection agent for an\nelectronics company from which Applicant purchased a computer several years ago.\nThe alleged amount delinquent ($64) is a late fee. Applicant denies SOR subparagraph\n1.e, asserting that he satisfied it. He provided no supporting documentary evidence. \nSOR subparagraph 1.f alleges a retail store account with a $662 delinquency.\nThe allegation is not supported by any documentation, and Applicant denies it.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\n\n3\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d Applicant contends that a period of unemployment contributed to his\nfinancial difficulties. His security clearance application indicates steady employment\nsince leaving the military. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not apply.\nThe government failed to produce evidence supporting the existence of a debt\nowed to the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.f, and Applicant denied it. I resolve\nthis SOR subparagraph in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nAs for SOR subparagraph 1.e, Applicant did not produce evidence establishing a\nreasonable basis for his dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201c the individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue,\u201d does not apply.\nApplicant provided evidence that he has satisfied an unlisted debt. This\ndemonstrates that he is sincere about confronting his financial delinquencies. However,\nhe provided no payment plan, no budget, nor any evidence of steady, past payments\n\n4\ntoward the satisfaction of the delinquent SOR debts. Consequently, neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20\n(c), \u201c . . . there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d nor 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a sensitive position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination must be an overall common sense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept.\nThe record contains scant evidence detailing the cause of Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems or his efforts at financial rehabilitation. Consequently, the likelihood of\ncontinuation remains unacceptably high. Upon considering the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nWITHDRAWN\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On May 13, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing. On October 29, 2008, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

For the following reasons, the Board affirms the\nJudge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nApplicant asserts that the government did not provide substantial evidence that Applicant is\nfinancially overextended.  Applicant states that Department Counsel did not call any witnesses or\nintroduce any statements by government employees regarding the bases for the SOR.  Applicant\nfurther asserts that the documentary evidence introduced is either outdated or supports Applicant\u2019s\nposition.\nThe fact that Department Counsel did not call witnesses or place the statements of\ngovernment employees on the record is not dispositive of the issue of the sufficiency of the\ngovernment\u2019s proof.   The government relied on Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, Applicant\u2019s answers\nto interrogatories and two credit reports to establish its case.  After a review of the record evidence,\nthe Board is satisfied that the government met its burden of production with regard to the security\nconcerns stated in the SOR.  \nApplicant argues that despite her inability to retire all her delinquent debts, she has been\nmaking an honest attempt to correct the situation and repay her debts.  She states that she has been\nable to retire a number of her outstanding debts notwithstanding the difficulties presented by her late\nhusband\u2019s illnesses and her own medical problems.  Applicant argues that because of these factors\nthe Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision should be reversed.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\nhas committed error.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She concluded that Guideline F Mitigating Condition 20.b.  applied to the\n1\ncase, acknowledging that Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s illness  and her own health issues contributed to her\n2\nfinancial situation.  The Judge also recognized that Applicant is making some efforts to repay her\ndebts.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the applicability of that factor was of\n\ninsufficient strength to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  Specifically, the Judge noted\nthat Applicant has a good paying job and elects to contribute to her 401(k) account to the detriment\nof her ability to retire her substantial delinquent student loan debt, which has been outstanding for\nmore than 12 years.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant was capable of doing more to resolve\nher delinquent accounts and did not act responsibly under the circumstances is supported by the\nrecord evidence.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that not enough time has passed to establish that Applicant\nwill make good on all her outstanding debt is also supported by the record.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form 86, on \nMarch 3, 2007. On May 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 17, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 3, 2008. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 1, 2008. On August 15, 2008, a Notice of \nHearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for September 12, 2008. The case was \nheard on that date. The Government offered four exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 4. Applicant testified, called two witnesses, and offered \nfive exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - E. The transcript was \nOctober 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nreceived on September 23, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.n, 1.o, and 1.p. She denies all remaining allegations.   \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old Internet technology specialist with a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance.  She has been employed with her \ncompany since 2008. She previously worked for another defense contractor from May \n2005 to February 2007. She has a master\u2019s degree in business administration. She is \nwidowed and has no children. She held a security clearance for about 10 years from \n1979 \u2013 1989. (Tr at 4-6; Gov 1.)  \n \nOn March 3, 2007, Applicant completed a security clearance application, \nStandard Form 86, in order to apply for a security clearance. (Gov 1.) A subsequent \nbackground investigation revealed that Applicant had 16 delinquent accounts, an \napproximate total balance of $97,490. Of that amount, approximately $87,306 was for \ndelinquent student loans.  The delinquent accounts include:  a $7,218 judgment for a \ndelinquent student loan entered against Applicant in May 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: AE B; AE C \nat 22); a $4,622 account for a deficiency judgment for an automobile repossession in \nMarch 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 3 at 8; AE C at 13, 15); a $59 past due telephone account \nfrom December 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 3 at 14; Gov 4 at 2; AE A at 1; AE C at 19); a \n$233 cell phone account placed for collection in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 3 at 5, 15); \na $528 delinquent account placed for collection in October 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 3 at \n13, 15).   \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $164 telephone account that was \nplaced for collection in February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 3 at 5, 16); a $496 cell phone \naccount placed for collection in February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 3 at 6, 16); a $133 \ntelephone account placed for collection in August 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 3 at 17); a \n$2,254 medical account placed for collection in August 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 3 at 7, 16; \nGov 4 at 2); a $305 medical account placed for collection in February 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: \nGov 3 at 17; Gov 4 at 2; AE C at 13); a $147 medical account placed for collection in \nSeptember 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 3 at 17; Gov 4 at 2); a $357 medical account placed \nfor collection in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 3 at 17; Gov 4 at 2; AE A at 2); a $325 \naccount placed for collection in September 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 3 at 7, 20; Gov 4 at \n2; AE C at 22); a $291 medical account placed for collection in May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.n: \nGov 4 at 2; AE C at 21); an $18,391 student loan account reported past due in August \n2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.0: Gov 3 at 14; Gov 4 at 2; AE A at 2); and a $61,967 student loan \naccount reported past due in August 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.p: Gov 3 at 14; Gov 4 at 2; AE A at \n2; AE C at 15, 17). \n \nIn 1995, Applicant\u2019s husband became ill. They had no health insurance. \nApplicant was a graduate school student and her husband was unemployed.  In 1996, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nshe got a job that had health insurance. However, the health insurance would not cover \nher husband because of his pre-existing condition. Applicant\u2019s husband passed away in \n1997. He had approximately $500,000 in unpaid medical bills when he died. Most of the \nmedical debts were written off due to the public health policy of the state where they \nwere living. The state mandates that uninsured patients be treated and their medical \ndebts are written off. (Tr at 25 \u2013 26.) \n \nFrom 2001 to 2005, Applicant had several periods of unemployment. She was \nunemployed from May 2000 to March 2001; from June 2001 to August 2001; from \nJanuary 2002 to March 2002; and from May 2004 to February 2005. (Gov 1.) Applicant \nhas been continuously employed since May 2005. (Tr at 30.)  \n \nApplicant states that she is paying off her debts to the best of her ability. She \noffered a credit report dated September 7, 2008 (AE C), which she claimed listed only \nthree delinquent accounts which include the federal student loans and two medical bills. \n(Tr at 21-22.) Aside from her late husband\u2019s medical issues, Applicant has had several \nhealth problems. In 2003, she had gall bladder surgery. In December 2007, she had a \nheart catheterization. She is diabetic and had surgery on her neck to remove a tumor. \n(Tr at 45-47.)  \n \nThe current status of the debts alleged in the SOR are: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: $7,218 judgment for state student loans has been paid through \ngarnishment. (Tr at 31-32; AE B; AE C at 22.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b:  $4,622 amount owed after automobile repossession. Applicant \nclaims the debt is closed because the car was resold. (Tr at 36.) The September 7, \n2008 credit report indicates the amount owed after resale was charged off but not paid. \n(AE C at 13.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $59 telephone account: Applicant initially denied this but paid it in \norder to get it resolved. (Tr at 37; AE A at 1; AE C at 19.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: $233 cell phone account placed for collection. Applicant does not \nknow what this account is. She claims the account is cancelled since it is not on her \nrecent credit report. (Tr at 37; AE C.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $528 collection account: Applicant disputes this debt. She is not \nfamiliar with this debt. (Tr at 38.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f:  $164 telephone bill: Applicant claims the bill was paid. No sufficient \nproof was presented to show the debt was resolved. (Tr at 39.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: $496 cell phone account: Applicant claims that her sister\u2019s boyfriend \nused Applicant\u2019s name to open a cell phone account. (Tr at 39.) The September 7, \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2008, credit report indicates that this account was paid after being charged off. (AE C at \n11.)  \n \nSOR \u00b61.h: $133 telephone account: Applicant claims it is paid. She does not \nremember when it was paid. She does not have a receipt. She claims it is no longer on \nher credit report. (Tr at 40.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: $2,254 medical account: Applicant claims she has made payment \nover the past six months and the balance is under $2,000. (Tr at 41; AE C at 9)) In May \n2008, she sent in a $50 payment to Dr. Q. (AE A.) She sent in $100 payments to Dr. Q. \nin July and August 2008. (AE D.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: $305 medical account: Applicant claims this is a bill related to her late \nhusband\u2019s medical issues. She claims the agency told her the debt had been cleared. \nShe had no documentation to verify this. (Tr at 42.) The September 7, 2008, credit \nreport lists this account as unpaid. (AE C at 13.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: $147 medical account: This is a medical bill incurred by Applicant \nwhich she claims was covered by the state indigent services agency. (Tr at 42.) She \npaid off the bill in two payments to Dr. M. She paid $50 in June 2008. (AE A.) She paid \n$97 in July 2008. (AE D.) This debt is paid. (Tr at 22, 49-50.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: $357 hospital bill: Applicant claims the debt was cancelled and paid \nby the state indigent services agency. (Tr at 43.) She paid $50 to this account in June \n2008. (AE A.) The September 7, 2008, credit report lists this account as an open unpaid \ncollection account. (AE C at 9.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: $325 collection account: Applicant does not recognize this account. \nShe claims she challenged the account to the credit reporting agencies through the \nInternet but provided no documentation. (Tr at 43-44.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: $291 medical account: Applicant is making payments. She believes \nthe balance on the account is $50 but provided no documents in support. (Tr at 44-45.) \nIn June 2008, Applicant paid $50 towards this account. (AE A.) She sent in a $50 \npayment in July 2008, and a $100 payment in August 2008. (AE D.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o: $18,391 defaulted federal student loan: Applicant completed her \neducation in 1996. The loans were initially deferred six months. Additional deferments \nwere granted for several years because of her husband\u2019s medical bills. Applicant makes \npayments on her student loans but not as much as the student loan company wants her \ntoo. They wanted approximately $500 to $600 a month. She claims she will increase her \npayment when other debts are paid. The student loan accounts remain in delinquent \nstatus.  (Tr at 31-34; 44-45.) She made two $50 payments in June 2008 which appear \nto apply to SOR \u00b6 1.o and SOR \u00b6 1.p. (AE A.) She made a $50 payment in July 2008 \nand a $100 payment in August 2008. (AE D.) She provided no information from the \nstudent loan agency as to her current loan balance and her past payment history.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: $61,967 defaulted federal student loan: See the information in the \nabove paragraph.  \n \nIn response to interrogatories, dated April 9, 2008, Applicant stated her monthly \ngross income was $8,166. Her total monthly deductions are $4,600, including a $1,300 \ndeduction to a 401(k) plan. Her net monthly income is $3,566. Her rent is $730. Other \nmonthly bills include groceries: $580, clothing: $200, car expenses: $630, medical \nexpenses: $350.  After expenses, she had approximately $726.40 left over each month. \n(Gov 2; see AE B: Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished approximately $550 per month at \nher previous job for one of her student loan accounts. It is not clear as to whether her \nwages are being garnished in her current job although she testified that the garnishment \ncontinues. (See Tr at 49.)) At hearing, Applicant stated that her expenses were about \nthe same but she had some additional medical bills. She pays $200 a month ($100 \neach) towards two new medical bills. Some medical bills are still coming in. She states \nthat she has no new delinquent debts in addition to the delinquent debts mentioned in \nthe SOR. She has not attended financial counseling. (Tr. at 45-48.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor from 2005-2008 testified. He states that Applicant is \ntrustworthy and has an exceptional work ethic. He would hire her back. He recommends \nthat she be given a security clearance. (Tr at 52-55.)  \n   \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor testified.  He knew her from her previous job. He \nwas a web developer and she was a data base administrator. He finds her extremely \ntrustworthy and dependable. They have worked many long nights together. He \nrecommends she be given a security clearance. (Tr at 56-58.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal friend has known her for 16 years. She describes her as \nhonest and trustworthy and proud of being able to serve her country. She is aware that \nApplicant has had to deal with larger than normal debt due to her husband\u2019s \ncatastrophic illness. She states there is nothing in her background that anyone could \nuse to make Applicant betray her country. (AE E.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. From 2001 to 2007, Applicant has \naccumulated over $97,490 in delinquent debt. A substantial amount of the debt relates \nto her defaulted federal student loan accounts. \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence by way of exhibits to raise \nsecurity concerns under financial considerations. The burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005)). \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant continues to have numerous delinquent accounts. Although she is making \nsome payments towards her student loan accounts, the accounts remain in delinquent \nstatus. \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s \nillness and her own health issues contributed to her financial situation. She also had \nseveral periods of unemployment from 2001 to 2005. There were circumstances beyond \nher control that adversely affected Applicant\u2019s finances. The next question to ask is \nwhether Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. While Applicant has paid \nsome of her bills, several accounts remain unresolved. Her largest debt, the federal \nstudent loans, remain in delinquent status. It has been over 12 years since Applicant \ncompleted her higher education. Since May 2005, Applicant has had a well-paying job. \nHer personal financial statement indicates that she had the money to pay sufficient \npayments on student loans to rehabilitate her delinquent accounts. After expenses, she \nhad $726 left over each month. She contributes $1,300 to her 401(k). She had the \ndiscretion to reduce her 401(k) contribution to apply more towards her delinquent \nstudent loan accounts. Based on the record evidence, Applicant was capable of doing \nmore to resolve her delinquent accounts. It cannot be concluded that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not received any financial counseling. While she \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhas resolved or is paying on several accounts, she still has a significant amount of \nunresolved debt. It is unlikely that her financial situation will improve in the future.   \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies in part. Applicant has submitted sufficient \nproof to show that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.k are paid. She is \npaying on several accounts. However, significant financial issues remain. Although she \nis making some payments towards her federal student loans, the accounts remain in \ndelinquent status because she is not making sufficient payments towards these \naccounts to enter into a formal rehabilitation plan to bring the accounts current. \nApplicant started to make payments on several accounts in June 2008. Not enough time \nhas passed to conclude that she will follow through on her payments towards these \ncreditors.  Although Applicant claims several of the debts are no longer on her credit \nreport, this does not mean that they have been resolved.  FC MC \u00b6 20(d) partially \napplies.    \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the medical bills \nincurred by Applicant and her late husband. I considered her past periods of \nunemployment.  I considered the favorable testimony of Applicant\u2019s friends and co-\nworkers. However, Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcern. A lot of unresolved accounts remain. Although Applicant is making some \npayments towards her federal student loans, which is by far the largest debt that she \nhas, the accounts remain in delinquent status. Her financial information indicates that \nshe has the capability to pay more towards these accounts.  Security concerns remain \nunder financial considerations.   \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines I\n(Psychological Conditions) and G (Alcohol Consumption) on March 5, 2009. The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nNovember 24, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted).\nGE 1; AE C; Tr. 89-125, 127-128.\n2\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 13, 2009. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on March 25, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request. Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on July 20, 2009, and I received the case assignment on July 22, 2009. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on September 1, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on September 28, 2009. The government offered  exhibits (GE) 1 through 7,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and three\nwitnesses testified on her behalf. She submitted exhibits (AE) A through C, which were\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on September\n28, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 6, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.f, and 2.a-2.c of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the factual allegation in \u00b6 2.d\nof the SOR.1\nApplicant, who is 28 years old, works as a technical writer and editor for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor.

She started regular use of alcohol on weekends with friends at parties\nwhen she was 16 years old. At 16, her personal problems began to overwhelm her. She\nexperienced thoughts about hurting herself, which concerned her. She discussed her\nfeelings with a friend.

Her initial psychiatrist diagnosed her with depression and prescribed medication.\nShe complied with the recommended treatment and medications.3\nApplicant graduated from high school in 1999. She enrolled in college and moved\nabout 100 miles from home. In the summer of 2000, after her freshman year of college,\nshe lived alone near her college. She became isolated and lonely, which led to negative\nthoughts and a suicide attempt with pills. She received medical treatment at a hospital\nemergency room and continued to follow treatment with her psychiatrist. She returned\nto school in the fall of 2000 as a sophomore.\nIn October 2000, her treating psychiatrist moved away. Before she moved, her\ntreating psychiatrist referred Applicant to another psychiatrist. Applicant met with her\ncurrent treating psychiatrist on October 2, 2000. Her current treating psychiatrist\ndiagnosed major depression and prescribed medication for Applicant. She also\nrecommended that Applicant go to the emergency room if she felt suicidal.4\nApplicant continued with her college education. She graduated in May 2003 with\na bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy and English. She continued with her medical\ntreatment plan and continued to consume alcohol.5\nIn February 2004, Applicant and her boyfriend celebrated Valentine\u2019s Day. She\nconsumed alcohol during the evening. As she drove home, the police stopped her for a\ntraffic violation. The police officer smelled alcohol and arrested her. On the breathalyzer\ntest, she register .07. The police charged her with driving under the influence (DUI). She\nattended an alcohol education program for six weeks, completing the program on April\n24, 2004. She appeared in court after she completed her program. The prosecutor nolle\nprossed the charges against her. Applicant has not been charged with DUI since this\ntime. She does not drink and drive, as she does not want to be arrested again.  \n6\nIn April 2004, about two months after receiving her DUI, Applicant met with a\npsychologist for an initial interview. The psychologist indicated that Applicant was\nagitated, her mood appeared depressed, and diagnosed substance abuse. Applicant\nmet with the psychologist regularly until October 2005. At this time, Applicant decided to\ndiscontinue her psychotherapy, but to continue with her medications. She continued to\nkeep her appointments with her psychiatrist during this same period of time, and after\ndiscontinuing her counseling sessions with the psychologist.7\n\nGE 4; Tr. 64-67, 141-144.\n8\nGE 5.\n9\nTr. 156, 158-159.\n10\nTr. 139-140, 146-147, 156-157.\n11\n4\nIn April 2006, Applicant began consuming increased amounts of alcohol. For 11\ndays prior to May 10, 2006, she increased her alcohol consumption for comfort. On May\n10, 2006, she again experienced thoughts of suicide. Instead of acting on her thoughts,\nshe drove herself to a local hospital emergency room for treatment. In his initial\nassessment, the emergency room physician diagnosed major depression and alcohol\nabuse without articulating the basis for this second diagnosis. The hospital admitted\nApplicant to partial hospitalization, meaning that she attended a daily treatment\nprogram, but could return home in the evenings and on the weekends. Applicant\nattended four all-day programs. At the conclusion of the fourth day, the hospital record\nnotes that her mood was stable; she did not have suicidal thoughts; she denied alcohol\nuse; and she did not have sleep difficulties. Thus, on May 16, 2006 and after\nconsultation with her treating psychiatrist, the hospital discharged her with a diagnosis\nof major depression. The records for this treatment also reference alcohol dependence\nfor Applicant, but made no final diagnosis on whether she was an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.8\nApplicant met with her previous treating psychologist on May 24, 2006 for a new\ninitial evaluation. The treating psychologist\u2019s notes indicated that Applicant increased\nher alcohol use for comfort, and that she had issues with anxiety and depression.\nApplicant met with her treating psychologist from May 2006 until August 2007, at which\ntime they agreed to discontinue treatment, since Applicant\u2019s condition had improved.9\nApplicant completed graduate school in May 2008. She received a master\u2019s\ndegree in contemporary communications. She continues to consume alcohol. She last\nbecame intoxicated in February 2008. She has decided to change her alcohol\nconsumption and her social friends. She no longer attends happy hour; instead she runs\nand participates in another local organization. She drinks to celebrate events, such as\nbirthdays, weddings, and other such occasions. She limits the amount of alcohol she\nconsumes.10\nApplicant has learned to identify those feelings where she may need extra help.\nWith the help of her treating psychologist, Applicant learned how to put things into\nperspective and manage her feelings. She can manage her depression and will seek\nhelp, if necessary. From the DUI, she learned to control her drinking.11\nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist, who is a medical doctor and Board-Certified in\nPsychiatry, testified as an expert witness. She began treating Applicant in October\n2000. After her initial interview, she diagnosed Applicant with major depression, single\nepisode, moderate to severe. After Applicant\u2019s arrest for DUI, the treating psychiatrist\n\nThe well-respected psychiatric reference, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\n12\nFourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). W ashington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000, has\ndefined \u201calcohol abuse\u201d to be a psychiatric condition that meets the following diagnostic criteria: \n \nA maladaptive pattern of alcohol abuse leading to clinically significant impairment or distress,\nas manifested by one or more of the following, occurring within a 12-month period: \n(1) Recurrent alcohol use resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school,\nor home (e.g., repeated absences or poor work performance related to substance use;\nsubstance-related absences, suspensions or expulsions from school; or neglect of children\nor household). \n(2) Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an\nautomobile or operating a machine). \n(3) Recurrent alcohol-related legal problems (e.g., arrests for alcohol-related disorderly\nconduct). \n(4) Continued alcohol use despite persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems\ncaused or exacerbated by the effects of the alcohol (e.g., arguments with spouse about\nconsequences of intoxication or physical fights). \nThese symptoms must never have met the criteria for alcohol dependence.\nAE A; Tr. 24-86.\n13\n5\ndiagnosed alcohol abuse, referencing the diagnosis code used in the DSM-IV.  The\n12\ntreating psychiatrist also diagnosed social anxiety. Applicant\u2019s depression symptoms are\nwell-controlled with medication and Applicant is doing extremely well functionally, as\nshown by her full-time employment and successful completion of her college education.\nApplicant keeps her appointments and has never come to an appointment intoxicated.\nIn her professional opinion, Applicant\u2019s alcohol use is under control. The treating\npsychiatrist opined that Applicant has no defect in judgment, reliability, or stability\nrelated to alcohol abuse, anxiety, and depression. Applicant complies with her\nmedication treatment plan. Applicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist stated that over the last nine\nyears of treatment, Applicant has grown from a 19-year-old teenager to a 28-year-old\nwoman. The treating psychiatrist opined that Applicant shows no indication of\nirresponsible, aggressive or antisocial behavior, or emotionally unstable behavior.\nApplicant is not and never hs been psychotic.13\nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist indicated that in 2006, Applicant actively misused\nalcohol. She also stated that Applicant\u2019s decision to go to the emergency room in May\n2006 showed good judgment. The treating psychiatrist was not concerned when\nApplicant declined to proceed through the second alcohol education program\nrecommended in May 2006 because such programs are more psycho-educational, and\nnot therapy. Over the last nine years, Applicant has become more invested in treatment\nand their relationship has improved, a sign of growth and maturity. Applicant follows her\ntreatment plan and her advice. Applicant is candid with the treating psychiatrist during\n\nThe treating psychiatrist does not conduct therapy sessions; rather a psychologist does. Such sessions are\n14\ncomplimentary to the work of the treating psychiatrist.\nTr. 24-86.\n15\nThe DSM-IV-TR has defined \u201calcohol dependence\u201d to be a psychiatric condition that meets the\n16\nfollowing diagnostic criteria: \n \nA maladaptive pattern of alcohol use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress,\nas manifested by three (or more) of the following, occurring at any time in the same 12-month\nperiod: \n(1) Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: (a) a need for markedly increased\namounts of the alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect; or (b) markedly diminished\neffect with continued use of the same amount of the alcohol. \n(2) W ithdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: (a) the characteristic withdrawal\nsyndrome for the alcohol; or (b) the same (or a closely related) alcohol is taken to relieve or\navoid withdrawal symptoms. \n(3) The alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.\n(4) There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use. \n(5) A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the alcohol (e.g., visiting\nmultiple doctors or driving long distances), use the alcohol or recover from its effects. \n(6) Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because\nof alcohol use. \n(7) The alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent\nphysical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the\nalcohol (e.g., continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by alcohol\nconsumption).\nGE 4. \n17\n6\nvisits.  Applicant has not reported problems at work, so the treating psychiatrist does\n14\nnot believe there are any work problems related to Applicant\u2019s depression. Overall,\nApplicant is doing very well and her medical problems are under control.15\nThe medical records from Applicant\u2019s hospital admission and the records of the\nemergency room physician reflect several diagnosis at the time of admission and during\nApplicant\u2019s partial hospitalization. The emergency room physician diagnosed major\ndepression and alcohol abuse in his admission assessment. When Applicant was\ndischarged from the partial hospitalization program, he diagnosed major depression\nonly. These records also contain a diagnosis of alcohol dependence  and alcohol\n16\nabuse. Neither diagnosis is explained using the criteria in the DSM-IV, nor are these\ndiagnoses included as part of the discharge diagnosis.17\n\n7\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n8\nAnalysis\nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions\nAG \u00b6 27 expresses the security concern pertaining to psychological conditions:\nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required for there to\nbe a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health professional (e.g.,\nclinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the\nU.S. Government, should be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference concerning the\nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of seeking mental health\ncounseling.\nAG \u00b6 28 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but\nnot limited to emotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent,\nparanoid, or bizarre behavior;\n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the\nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may\nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and, \n(c) the individual has failed to follow treatment advice related to a\ndiagnosed emotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g., failure to take\nprescribed medication.\nApplicant experienced serious emotional problems at age 16. She sought\nprofessional help from a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant with major\ndepression, which is not a psychotic condition. Applicant continues to suffer from major\ndepression and social anxiety. The government has established a security concern\nunder AG \u00b6 28(b). Because she attempted suicide nine years ago, the government also\nestablished a security concern under AG \u00b6 28(a).\nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the\nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the\ntreatment plan;\n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment\nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is\n\n9\ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a\nduly qualified mental health professional; and\n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed\nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an\nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a\nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation.\nAt age 16, Applicant sought treatment for emotional problems, which were\ndiagnosed as depression. Psychiatrists later diagnosed her with social anxiety. In the\nlast 12 years, she has continually been under the care of a psychiatrist and licensed\nprofessional for her depression and social anxiety. Over this same period of time, she\nhas regularly taken the medication prescribed for her condition. Her current treating\npsychiatrist, a Board-Certified psychiatrist, confirms Applicant\u2019s compliance with her\nprescribed medications. She also describes Applicant\u2019s depression as well-controlled\nwith medication and opines that Applicant is doing extremely well functionally. Applicant\nvoluntarily continues with her treatment plan developed by her treating psychiatrist. She\nparticipated in psychotherapy in the past, which led to a better understanding of her\npast suicide attempt. Treatment with her psychologist is available if she needs it in the\nfuture. Applicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist indicated that over the nine years that she has\ntreated Applicant, she has complied with their treatment plan and that her relationship\nwith Applicant has improved because as she matures, Applicant is more invested in\ntreatment. Overall, her treating psychiatrist concluded that Applicant has no defect in\njudgment, reliability, or stability related to her depression or social anxiety. In addition,\nher treating psychiatrist also stated that Applicant shows no indication of irresponsible,\naggressive or antisocial behavior, or emotionally unstable behavior. Applicant works and\ncompleted both a bachelor\u2019s degree and master\u2019s degree while under the care of the\ntreating psychiatrist. Applicant\u2019s work history and work performance reflect her stability\nand high level of functioning. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns about her depression and social anxiety under AG \u00b6 29(a) and 29(b).\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing conditions may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n\nSee Hensley v. Astrue, 573 F.3d 263 (6  Cir. 2009); Jericol Mining, Inc. v. Napier, 301 F.3d 703 (6  Cir.\n18\nth\nth\n2002). \n10\n.\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent;\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician,\nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence; and\n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion\nof an alcohol rehabilitation program.\nApplicant began consuming alcohol on a regular basis at age 16. She continued\nto consumed alcohol on a regular basis for a number of years, leading to her arrest for\nDUI in 2004. After her arrest, she continued to consume alcohol, sometimes to\nintoxication. Her treating psychiatrist diagnosed her as an alcohol abuser after her\narrest. In 2006, she consumed alcohol for 11 days prior to her self-admission to a local\nhospital emergency room. The emergency room physician initially assessed her with\nalcohol abuse, then later opined that she was alcohol dependent. Because Applicant\u2019s\ntreating psychiatrist has worked with her for more than nine years, is familiar with her\ntreatment and medical history, is Board-Certified in psychiatry, and is a specialist in\nemotional problems as connected to alcohol issues, I find her opinion that Applicant is\nan alcohol abuser more credible than the emergency room physician\u2019s assessment of\nalcohol dependence after one visit. His conflicting diagnoses of alcohol abuse and\nalcohol dependence, which are not clearly explained, are given little weight.  The\n18\nrecord contains insufficient evidence to indicate that Applicant relapsed after completion\nof an alcohol rehabilitation program because the medical records do not state that she\nmust stop drinking, only that she reduce her consumption. The government has\nestablished its case under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), and 22(d).  \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns and the\nfollowing may be applicable in this case:\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and\n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\n\n11\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant acknowledges that she continues to drink on a limited basis. She has\nnever admitted to being an alcoholic and her treating psychiatrist has not described her\nas an alcoholic. After receiving her first and only DUI in 2004, Applicant decided not to\ndrink and drive, and does not. She participated in the alcohol education program\nrequired by the court. By May 2006, Applicant\u2019s depression and emotional  issues were\nbecoming a problem. She began drinking more often and consumed alcohol for 11 days\nbefore driving to the emergency room for help. After her release from the hospital\nprogram, she returned to her psychologist for more therapy, which she did for more than\na year. She also sought treatment from her treating psychiatrist, and continues to\nreceive treatment. Her treating psychiatrist indicated that Applicant\u2019s alcohol\nconsumption is under control. Applicant now limits her alcohol consumption to special\noccasions. Her alcohol consumption does not interfere with her work nor does it impact\nher finances. In light of her treating psychiatrist\u2019s professional opinion, Applicant has\nmitigate the government\u2019s security concerns about her alcohol consumption under AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) because her use of alcohol is limited and responsible.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \n\n12\nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of a denial. In\nreaching this conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nbegan drinking regularly at age 16 and continues to drink. She drank to intoxication on\noccasions until 18 months ago. Her excessive drinking resulted in a DUI charge in 2004,\nbut no conviction. She also started suffering from depression at age 16.\nWhen Applicant first started to experience thoughts about harming herself, she\ndiscussed her concerns about these thoughts with a friend. She followed her friend\u2019s\nsuggestion to seek professional help. For more than 12 years, Applicant has received\nmedical treatment and participated in psychological counseling as needed. She takes\nthe medication prescribed to her. During this same period of time, she graduated from\nhigh school. She completed her bachelor\u2019s degree in the usual four years and\ncompleted her master\u2019s degree while working full-time. Applicant is highly respected at\nher office. She is a sought-after technical writer because of her exceptionally good\ncommunication skills. Her work performance is excellent. She reports to work on time\nand works extra when necessary. Her employer considers her a very trustworthy,\nhonest, and reliable employee. \nApplicant continues to drink, but in moderation. She does not want another DUI\narrest, so she does not drink and drive. While it took her awhile to accept that she must\nmodify her alcohol consumption, she has realized that she must reduce her alcohol\nconsumption and did so. She has new friends and new activities unrelated to drinking.\nShe is maturing. She understands how to drink alcohol in a responsible manner and to\nmanage her depression. Despite her past problems, Applicant has shown that she is\ntrustworthy and honest.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her psychological\nconditions and her alcohol consumption.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline I:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\n\n13\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 28, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\n\n1 The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to the SOR allegation of falsification under Guideline E concerning\nthe IRS lien.  \n2\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 30, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn appeal, Applicant raises the following issues: whether she was afforded due process\nbefore and during the hearing; whether the Judge was biased against her because she is\ntransgendered; and whether the Judge should have found her financial situation to be mitigated\nbecause the accrual of her debts was beyond her control.  Applicant lists a number of reasons why\nshe feels the hearing was unfair to her.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant is a retired non-\ncommissioned officer with over 24 years of service.  After retiring from military service, Applicant\nunderwent a change in gender identity, from male to female.  Applicant\u2019s 30-year marriage ended,\nand Applicant has since married another woman.  Applicant worked sporadically between 1991 and\n1998.  Following a steady job lasting 16 months, Applicant again had a number of short-term jobs.\nShe now works steadily for a defense contractor.  Applicant\u2019s military retirement of $753 per month\nis divided between her and her former spouse.  Applicant\u2019s SOR lists over $45,000 in debts, many\nof which Applicant admits.  Applicant\u2019s debt of over $11,000 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),\nwhich has been reduced to a  lien,  arose during periods of sporadic employment while Applicant\nwas still married to her first wife.  As part of the divorce agreement, Applicant accepted\nresponsibility for the whole debt.  Another debt is for over $20,000.  A few of the debts are\nduplications, as to which the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor.  Applicant has hired an attorney to\nsettle her IRS debt, and a debt consolidation company to settle other debts.  Neither the attorney nor\nthe debt consolidation company had achieved any results at the time of the hearing.  Applicant failed\nto disclose the IRS lien on her security clearance application.1\nApplicant appeared pro se.  However, Applicant\u2019s spouse, who was also a character witness,\nappeared with Applicant as a personal representative.  In her appeal brief, Applicant lists several\nreasons why she feels the hearing process was unfair.  1.  Applicant expresses concern over the fact\nthat the Judge explained the appeal process at the very beginning of the hearing.  2.  Although she\nrequested that the hearing be held in City A, she was inconvenienced by having to travel from City\nA to City B for the hearing, a distance of 90 miles.  3.  The Judge was \u201ccordial,\u201d but Department\nCounsel was \u201cdefensive and disrespectful.\u201d  4.  Applicant was \u201ccut off\u201d from presenting her whole\nargument because of time limitations.  The hearing started late in the day and had to end by the time\nthe building closed for the day.  The hearing could not continue the next day because Department\nCounsel had another hearing scheduled in another city.  5.  Applicant was harmed because the record\nwas only held open for two weeks for Applicant to provide additional evidence, and that was not\nenough time for her to acquire the evidence she sought to provide. \n\n2The Pre-Hearing Guidance for DOHA Industrial Security Clearance (ISCR) Hearings and Trustworthiness\n(ADP) Hearings, as posted on DOHA\u2019s website and provided to applicants states that hearings are generally held within\n150 miles of an applicant\u2019s residence or place of employment.  City A and City B are about 90 miles apart.\n3In the Transcript at 76-79, the Judge suggested a period of 14 days for Applicant to submit character references\nand information about her military career.  Applicant agreed.  The Judge then pointed out that if Applicant could not meet\nthe deadline she should contact Department Counsel and \u201cwe\u2019ll resolve it.\u201d  During testimony regarding Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial situation, the Judge referred to the 14-day period several times.  Applicant never objected to the length of time\nallowed.  Transcript at 119, 131, 133-134, 177-178.\n4Transcript at , e.g., 41, 171, 172, 173.\n3\nAlthough pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take\ntimely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive; if they fail to take such steps, that\nfailure does not constitute denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21329 at 2 (App. Bd.\nSep. 25, 2006).  In this case, a hearing was begun in City A on January 28, 2009, but the case was\ncontinued because Applicant did not receive copies of the government\u2019s evidence until that day.\nThe hearing was rescheduled in City B on February 25 based on a telephone call to which Applicant\nwas a party.2  The hearing began at 12:57 pm, just before the scheduled time of 1:00 pm.  The Judge\ntold the parties that the courtroom had to be vacated by 5:00 pm.  After Applicant provided\ndocumentary evidence, testified on her own behalf, and elicited testimony from her spouse, the\nJudge asked Applicant whether she had any additional evidence to present.  Applicant responded\nin the negative.  Transcript at 170.  The hearing was adjourned at 4:23 pm.  Applicant did not\nrequest more time to present evidence that afternoon or at a later time.  The Judge discussed with\nApplicant the length of time for which the record would be held open for Applicant to submit\nadditional evidence.3 Applicant did not object to a period of 14 days.  Since Applicant did not object\nat the hearing to actions such as the adjournment and the 14-day period, she cannot now argue that\nher right to due process was violated by those actions.  After a review of the record, the Board finds\nno indication that Applicant was denied due process. \nMoreover, there is a rebuttable presumption that federal officials and employees carry out\ntheir duties in good faith.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-07635 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 22, 2008).  A\nparty seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  Applicant\ncharacterizes Department Counsel as \u201cdefensive and disrespectful,\u201d and states that Department\nCounsel referred to Applicant as \u201che\u201d rather than \u201cshe.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s characterization of Department\nCounsel\u2019s manner is not demonstrative of error by the Judge.  In the transcript, Department Counsel\nrefers to Applicant as \u201cshe,\u201d \u201cher\u201d and \u201cMs.\u201d4  Applicant has not met her burden of persuasion,\nbecause she has not identified anything in the record that suggests a basis for a reasonable person\nto conclude that Department Counsel acted improperly, or engaged in a course of conduct that had\nthe effect of denying Applicant due process.\nTo the extent that Applicant raises an allegation of bias on the part of the Judge, there is a\nrebuttable presumption that quasi-judicial officials are unbiased and impartial, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden on appeal.  When the Board considers a claim of bias,\nthe standard is not whether the appealing party personally believed that the Judge was biased.\n\n5DOHA Judges regularly explain the appeal process, along with other administrative matters, at the beginning\nof hearings.\n4\nRather, the standard is whether the record contains any indication that the Judge acted in a manner\nthat would lead a disinterested person to question the fairness or impartiality of the Judge.5  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-25545 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2007).  In this case, Applicant offers no explanation\nfor her claim of bias other than the adverse decision.  In fact, Applicant states that the Judge was\n\u201ccordial.\u201d  Applicant has not demonstrated bias.\nApplicant also maintains in her appeal brief that the accrual of her debts was beyond her\ncontrol.  This is an argument in favor of mitigation of her financial situation.  However, the presence\nof some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance\ndecision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether\nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  In his decision, the Judge discussed the possible application\nof the relevant mitigating conditions in Applicant\u2019s case and explained why the evidence of\nmitigation was not sufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns. \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant 3 are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant is a retired non-commissioned officer with over eight years of service in the Marine Corps and 16 years of service in the Army. His service included tours in Vietnam, for which he was awarded several decorations, including a Purple Heart (R.T., at 73). Following his discharge from the Marines in 1975, he tried several civilian jobs before enlisting in the Army. Once enlisted in the Army, he was quickly promoted to the rank of E-7 (R.T., at 73-74), and he served in the Desert Storm campaign. After completing his Desert Storm tour, Applicant faced the demise of his father- in-law, and retired (R.T., at 80). Once retired, he encountered age bias in his search for civilian work. So, he enrolled in community college and pursued his associates arts degree (R.T., at 82). Between 1991 and 1998, Applicant was employed sporadically. Financial pressures in his home weakened his marriage, and prompted his separation in 2004 (see ex. 11). During these difficult times, Applicant also endured various physical problems associated with his gender identity. Convinced he was a girl, he changed his gender from male to female (R.T., at 83-84). Once he made the gender change, his wife of 30 years told him tha",

The case was assigned to me on February 2, 2009, and was scheduled for\nhearing on January 28, 2009.  The case was called a the convened hearing on the\nscheduled date and continued.  The case was then rescheduled for February 25, 2009.\nA hearing was held as rescheduled, for the purpose of considering whether it would be\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s\nApril 30, 2009\n\n2\napplication for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of\neight exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and 11 exhibits (AEs\nA-G).  The transcript (R.T.) was received March 10, 2009.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nAt the outset of the hearing, I denied Applicant\u2019s motion for a change of venue to\nthe city of his residence (within 100 miles of the site of this hearing).  Applicant then\namended his response to answer subparagraph 2.a of the SOR, which he had\npreviously failed to answer.  He admitted to omitting his federal tax lien in responding to\nquestion 27 of his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (e-QIP), but not\nintentionally.  His answer was treated as a denial.\nPrior to the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to strike sub-\nparagraphs 1.xx through 1.fff as duplicate accounts.  There being no objection from\nApplicant and good cause being demonstrated, Department counsel\u2019s motion to strike\nwas granted (R.T., at 140-141).\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documented payments of two of his medical debts.  For good cause shown,\nApplicant was granted 14 days to supplement the record with documented awards,\ncharacter references and payments. The Government was afforded two days to\nrespond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant provided copies of a personal financial\nstatement, payment letters, military awards, and a payment offer from one of the listed\ncreditors. Department counsel did not object to the admission of the submissions.  The\nsubmissions were admitted as exhibits H through N.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated 61 delinquent\ndebts exceeding $50,000.00, (b) had a judgment entered against him in January 1995\nfor $819.00, and (c) been subjected to a federal tax lien.  \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his e-QIP by omitting the\nfederal tax lien filed against him in February 2004 in the amount of $11,765.00.\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the allegations. He\nadmitted some of the debts but denied others.  He claimed he is a military veteran and\nis not a dishonest person. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 58-year-old logistics manager for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\n\n3\nare incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional\nfindings follow.\nApplicant is a retired non-commissioned officer with over eight years of service in\nthe Marine Corps and 16 years of service in the Army.   His service included  tours in\nVietnam, for which he was awarded several decorations, including a Purple Heart (R.T.,\nat 73).  Following his discharge from the Marines in 1975, he tried several civilian jobs\nbefore enlisting in the Army.  Once enlisted in the Army, he was quickly promoted to the\nrank of E-7 (R.T., at 73-74), and he served in the Desert Storm campaign.\nAfter completing his Desert Storm tour, Applicant faced the demise of his father-\nin-law, and retired (R.T., at 80).  Once retired, he encountered age bias in his search for\ncivilian work.  So, he enrolled in community college and pursued his associates arts\ndegree (R.T., at 82).\nBetween 1991 and 1998, Applicant was employed sporadically.  Financial\npressures in his home weakened his marriage, and prompted his separation in 2004\n(see ex. 11).  During these difficult times, Applicant also endured various physical\nproblems   associated with his gender identity.  Convinced he was a girl, he changed his\ngender from male to female (R.T., at 83-84).  Once he made the gender change, his\nwife of 30 years told him that she could not live with him anymore.  Thereupon, they\nseparated and divorced.  Applicant has since married another woman (R.T., at 169).\nWhile working temporary jobs, Applicant was informed by the IRS he owed the\nService over $11,000.00 (R.T., at 85-86).   In an effort to settle the claim, he inquired of\nthe IRS about a compromise.  When the IRS indicated it wanted $350 to $400 a month\nfrom him to settle the IRS tax claim, Applicant declined (R.T., at 87).\nIn 1998, Applicant found a warehouse job in another state (R.T., at 87-88).  He\naccepted the job and spent the ensuing 16 months on this job before he was told the\ncompany was going out of business and would have no further need for his services\n(R.T., at 88).  \nBetween 1998 and 2002, Applicant worked odd jobs as a night watch manager\nand warehouse operator (R.T., at 89-90).  He had several jobs with different companies\nbefore accepting a defense job in 2005 (R.T., at 93).  He lost this job in 2006 when the\nemployer\u2019s contract was canceled. He was hired by his current employer in April 2007,\nand has maintained continuous employment with this employer (R.T., at 99-100).\nApplicant receives retirement pay from his military service.  However, his ex-wife\nreceives half of his $753.00 monthly retirement check pursuant to their final divorce\ndecree.\nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts between 1998 and 2005.\nSome of the listed debts in the SOR are duplications.  The remaining debts exceed\n$45,000.00.  Several of them are quite large.  For instance, the creditor 1.aa debt lists a\n\n4\n$20,000.00 delinquent obligation to this creditor.  Applicant has an agreement with a\ndebt consolidation company (ex. E), which Applicant has tasked to work with some of\nhis major creditors (R.T., at 112-113).  To date, though, this company has not been able\nto produce any documented payment plans with any of his creditors (inclusive of\ncreditor 1.r through creditor 1.v and creditor 1.aa). \n Another major listed obligation is a February 2004 tax lien filed by the IRS\n(creditor 1.z).  This lien covers a $11,765.86 tax debt owed by Applicant and his ex-wife.\nUnder his settlement agreement with his ex-wife, Applicant assumed the tax obligation\non behalf of both spouses (R.T., at 162-163).  Applicant has engaged an attorney to\npursue an offer in compromise with the IRS (see ex. A).  To date, he has not heard\nanything back from the IRS on his compromise offer.\nApplicant has continued to work on paying off his smaller debts.  He documents\npayment of debts owed to creditor 1.v, creditor 1.x, creditor 1.y/1.mm (same company,\nR.T. ,at 113-118, 125-126), creditor 1.oo, creditor 1.rr, creditor 1.tt and creditor 1.hhh.\nHe has payment agreements with creditor 1.a (ex. I), creditor 1.pp, and creditor 1.jjj, and\nassures he will be making payments to these creditors (R.T., at 143).  Once he pays\nthese debts off, they will be removed from his credit report, and he can then focus\npaying on his larger debts.\nAmong Applicant\u2019s document submissions is a compromise offer from the\ncollection agency for creditor 1.aa., in which the creditor indicates it will accept\n$8,737.12 in full settlement of the creditor\u2019s claimed debt of $21,842.79 (see ex. M).\nApplicant provides no documented acceptance of the offer, however, and it remains\nunclear how he plans to address the debt owed to creditor 1.aa.  Applicant did not have\nany answers either at hearing as to how he would be addressing creditors 1.bb through\n1.ll (R.T., at 152).\nApplicant has monthly gross income of $6,647.00.  His expense and debt\npayments total $4,341.00, which leaves him with a net monthly remainder of $2,306.00\n(see ex. H).   \nAsked to complete his e-Qip in July 2007, Applicant failed to disclose his federal\ntax lien when responding to question 27.  To be sure, there are no clear explanations in\nthe record as to why Applicant omitted his tax lien.  Clearly, he was aware of back\nfederal taxes owed, having assumed the tax obligations as a part of his divorce\nsettlement. \nWhen asked about debts over 180 days delinquent in question 28 of the same e-\nQIP, Applicant candidly acknowledged having such delinquent debts (see ex. 1).\nApplicant\u2019s affirmative answer to delinquent debts when responding to question 28\nmanifestly shows he was not disposed to concealing his delinquent debts (inclusive of\nhis tax debts), and is sufficient to warrant inferences he did not deliberately attempt to\nconceal his tax obligations from the Government.\n\n5\nApplicant earned a number of awards and commendations during his military\nservice enlistment (ex. L).  His credits include professional training and achievement\ncertificates (see ex. F).  He is well regarded by a community little league for whom he\nprovides voluntary umpire services (see ex. G; R.T., at 103-04).  Applicant has been\numpiring for over 35 years at the little league and high school levels, for which he\nreceives modest compensation (R.T., at 105-107, 157).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG), \u00b6\n18.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n\n6\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a responsible employee of a defense contractor who accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts during periods of unemployment and underemployment.\nWhile he is able to document payment of a number of small debts and payment\narrangements with several other creditors, he has not been able to make any major\nheadway with most of his creditors, including all of his listed major debts. \nFinancial issues\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and his past inability to pay these debts warrant the application of two\n\n7\nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines DC \u00b6 19(a), inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts, and \u00b619(c)) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable to recurrent periods of unemployment and under\nemployment between 1998 and 2006.  Faced with so many pressing challenges in\nfinding sustainable work, and still manage the responsibilities he faces in his new\nrelationship, Applicant has struggled with his mounting debts.  His progress to date in\nregaining control of his finances is promising, but still a considerable work in progress\nthat is only recently being addressed.  He still is working on taking care of his small debts\nand can provide no estimates as to when he will be able to address his major debts (to\ninclude his federal  tax lien, his outstanding judgment, and his creditor 1.aa debt). \nBased on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish\nsome extenuating circumstances associated with his debt accumulations.  As a result,\nMC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibility,\u201d has some application to Applicant\u2019 s circumstances. \nFull mitigation credit is not available to Applicant based on the facts of this case.\nNeither Applicant\u2019s oral or written evidence reflect any initiated voluntary repayment\nefforts in his behalf on his major debts.  His documented payments and payment\nagreements with individual creditors and debt consolidation firm are encouraging, but not\nenough at this time to warrant full application of any of the mitigating conditions covered\nin the financial guideline.\n                                            \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts.  His military service merits\nconsiderable praise and commendation. His many certificates of training and\nachievement in his civilian career reflect positively on Applicant\u2019s career commitments\nand professional growth. Still, he has not shown enough tangible effort in addressing his\ncovered debts to mitigate his still delinquent debts and credit him with restored control\nover his finances.  In balance, whole person assessment does not enable Applicant to\nestablish judgment and trust levels sufficient to enable him to overcome appraised\nsecurity concerns arising out his accumulation of delinquent debts.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources he has had to address them with,\nthe limited steps he has mounted to address his old debts, it is still too soon to make\n\n8\nsafe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and restore his\nfinances to stable levels commensurate with his holding a security clearance.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1b through 1.u, 1.w, 1.z, 1.aa through 1.ll, 1.nn,1.qq, 1.ss, 1.uu through\n1.ww, 1.ggg, 1.iii and 1.kkk. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.v, 1.x, 1.y (duplicated in 1.mm), 1.oo, 1.pp,1.rr, 1.tt, 1.hhh, and\n1.jjj. \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omission\nPosing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant\u2019s documented omitted tax\nlien in the e-QIP he completed in June 2007.  He denied any intent to falsify in his\namended answer and affirmatively admitted his having debts over 180 days delinquent\nwhen responding to question 28 of his e-QIP.  His disclosure of his delinquent debts in\nthe ensuing question 28 is sufficient to avert any inferences of knowing and wilful\nattempts to hide his financial problems.\nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant presents as an essentially honest\napplicant who experienced numerous periods of unemployment and underemployment\nand ensuing financial problems.  None of his accumulated debts, though, reflect any acts\nof dishonesty.  Both his military service and work in his community with little league\nattest to his overall honesty.\nBased on Applicant\u2019s admission of his delinquent debts (tax debt included) and\noverall showing of honesty, Applicant is able to successfully refute the allegations of\ndeliberate falsification in the SOR.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraph 2.a of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras.    1b through 1.u, 1.w, 1.z,\nAgainst Applicant\n                                1.aa through 1.ll, 1.nn,1.qq,  \n                                1.ss, 1.uu through 1.ww, \n                                1.ggg, 1.iii and 1.kkk: \n \nSub-paras.\n1.a, 1.v, 1.x, 1.y, 1.mm, 1.oo,\nFor Applicant\n \n1.pp, 1.rr, 1.tt, 1.hhh, and 1.jjj.\n\n9\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONALCONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

She is employed by a defense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.

Mendez, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 30, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions dated November\n14,  2007.  On October 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended\nreferral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 6, 2008, in which\nshe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on January 14, 2008.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information\nin rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on January 23, 2009, and she submitted no reply.  The case was assigned to the\nundersigned for resolution on March 24, 2009.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe FORM and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 32 years old.  She is employed by a\ndefense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nsubparagraph.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated December 7, 2007 and July 30,\n2008, indicate that she remains indebted to nine separate creditors totaling the amount\nof approximately $10,306.00.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6).  None of the delinquent\ndebts set forth in the SOR have been paid.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems began in college.  Most of the\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt was incurred between 2001 and 2004 with one debt\nbecoming delinquent in 2007.  Admittedly, the debts are old,  have never been resolved,\nand have either been written off by the creditor or have automatically fallen off of her\ncredit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).\nThe Applicant recently retained a consumer credit counselor to assist her with\nresolving her delinquent debt.  The credit counselor will help her locate each creditor,\nlower the interest rates, and establish a payment plan to get the debt paid.   \nApplicant\u2019s financial statement dated May 23, 2008, indicates that after paying\nher monthly living expenses and current bills, she has approximately $500.00 in\ndisposable income to use to pay her delinquent debts.  (Government Exhibit 7).      \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she intentionally falsified material\naspects of her personal background during the employment process.\nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nsubparagraph.  She completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Sensitive Position dated\nNovember 14, 2007.  Question 28(a) of the application asked the Applicant if in the last\nseven years has she been 180 days delinquent on any debts.  Question 28(b) of the\nsame questionnaire asked the Applicant whether she was currently over 90 days\n\n3\ndelinquent on any debts. The Applicant answered, Yes, to both questions and listed two\ndebts, one medical bill in the amount of $300.00, and a credit card bill for $212.00.  She\nfailed to disclose the other eight delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  (Government\nExhibit 4).  \nThe Applicant acknowledges that when she answered questions 28(a) and 28(b),\nshe failed to provide all of the information that she was aware of.  She states that she\nwas told by her security manager that she only had to go back five years.  She also\nstates that she her credit report was confusing and she was not sure how to interpret it. \n       \n \nI find that the Applicant deliberately failed to answer the questions accurately on\nthe questionnaire because she intentionally wanted to conceal the truth from the\ngovernment.  She knew or should have known to be honest and candid with the\nGovernment in filling out the questionnaire.  By deliberately providing false information\nto the Government on this questionnaire, the Applicant violated federal law, Title 18,\nUnited States Code, Section 1001.   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n4\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16(a)  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n5\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment\nor unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F) and she has been untruthful\non her Electronic Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (Guideline E).  This evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with her security clearance eligibility.\nWith respect to her finances, the Applicant has in excess of $10,000.00 in\ndelinquent debt.  Presumably, because they were old debts, she thought she did not\n\n6\nhave to pay them.  WRONG!  She has not made even one payment toward resolving\nany of the delinquent debts in the SOR.  To her credit, she has recently hired a credit\ncounselor to help her with her finances.  She has only started the financial rehabilitation\nprocess and has a long way to go before her debts are resolved.  At the present time,\nshe has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of financial\nresponsibility or that she has resolved her financial indebtedness.\nUpon review of her financial statement, it appears that she has $500.00 in\ndisposable income at the end of the month to pay her past due bills.  Despite this, she\nhas failed to use any of it to pay her delinquent debts.  There is no evidence of financial\nrehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying\nConditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations apply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  Her\nfinancial problems remain current, they are not isolated.  The Applicant has not initiated\na prompt, good faith effort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her\ndebts.   Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).  \nWith respect to Guideline E, the Applicant deliberately concealed material\ninformation from the Government on her security clearance application in response to\nher financial matters.  With the particular evidence that I have been provided, there is no\nreasonable excuse for her failure to answer the questions truthfully.  If she is to be\ntrusted with the national secrets, she must be honest with the Government at all times.\nConsequently, the evidence shows that the Applicant cannot be trusted with the national\nsecrets.  Disqualifying Condition 16(a)  the deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.  None of the\nmitigating conditions are applicable.  I find that the Applicant deliberately sought to\nconceal material information from the Government and that she cannot be trusted with\nthe national secrets.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.     \n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The case was assigned to me on October 30, 2008, and was scheduled for\nhearing on December 17, 2008.  A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of eight exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself)\nJanuary 29, 2009\n\n2\nand two exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received December 29, 2008.  Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of payment of her two medical bills (covered by creditors 1.b\nand 1.c). For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to December 24,\n2008 to supplement the record.  The Government was granted to December 30, 2008,\nto  respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant provided copies of her payment\nreceipts for the two medical bills referenced at the hearing.  Department counsel did not\nobject to the admission of the submissions.  The submissions were admitted as exhibits\nC and D.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated four debts\nexceeding $20,000.00.  For her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the\nallegations. She claimed that her medical debt covered by creditor 1.a represented a\nbilling for emergency room treatment in 2005, at a time when she had no insurance.\nShe claimed that she has since paid a major part of this debt and has worked out a\npayment plan for the balance.  She claimed the two small debts covered in the SOR\nrepresent bills that should have been covered by her ex-husband\u2019s Tricare insurance.\nShe claimed it was her intention to pay these debts herself.  And she claimed her car\nrepossession (covered by creditor 1.d) occurred in August 2001, and resulted from her\nfamily\u2019s diminished household income following her ex-husband\u2019s military relocation,\nand inability to make the scheduled car payments.  She claimed her ex-husband made\nno effort to help Applicant settle this joint debt, which no longer appears on he credit\nreport. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old equipment attendant for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant married husband one (H1) in 1989 and divorced him in 1993 (R.T., at\n38).  She married H2 in 1994 and divorced him in October 1995 (R.T., at 38).  She has\na son (age 18) from her marriage to H1 (R.T., at 39).  She married H3 in July 1996,\nseparated from him in 2002, and divorced him in 2008 (R.T., at 37).  She has a\ndaughter (age 8) by H3 (R.T., at 29).  Following her divorce from H3, she sent her son\nto live with her parents while she looked for work.  Currently, both children reside with\nher (R.T., at 39).\n\n3\nBetween 2004 and 2005, Applicant accumulated several medical debts; three\naltogether totaling just under $2,000.00.  She attributes her medical debts to medical\nvisits for herself and children after she became a single parent (R.T., at 43-45).  The two\nsmaller debts were supposed to have been covered by H3's Tricare benefit program,\nbut were not paid by Tricare, or H3.   Applicant asked H3 to look into these two bills, but\nhas heard nothing back from him (R.T., at 30, 43-44).  He is now deployed overseas,\nwhich makes it difficult for him to correspond (R.T., at 30).\n When H3 abandoned her in 2002, she had no medical insurance for herself or\nher children.  Her daughter was born with a multi-cystic left kidney and an enlarged right\nkidney that caused developmental delays and ensuing learning disabilities (R.T., at 28).\nSo, when her daughter developed a kidney infection, Applicant had no alternative but to\ntake her to an emergency hospital for treatment (R.T., at 26-27).  The cost bill for\ntreating her daughter was $1,545.00.  Unable to pay the bill at the time with the limited\nresources at her disposal, and no assistance from H3, Applicant ignored the bill.  The\nmedical provider, in turn, assigned its claim to a collection agency, who initiated suit\nagainst her in state court to recover its costs.  Applicant later worked out a payment\nplan with the creditor to repay the debt and documents full settlement of the claim (see\nex. B).  \nApplicant\u2019s fourth listed debt represents the largest of her covered debts.  While\nshe and H3 were living on an Air Force (AF) duty installation, and were anticipating the\nbirth of their daughter, they jointly acquired a 1998 Mercury in July 1999 for about\n$18,000.00 (R.T., at 65-66).  They traded in their leased van on this vehicle and added\nthe $9,000.00 still owing on the van lease to the aggregate amount of their available\ncredit from the lender.  Applicant\u2019s accepted car payments on the vehicle were $382.00\na month (R.T.,at 66-67).  Applicant\u2019s 2008 credit report cites an available credit line of\n$27,297.00 (see ex. 4).  It is not clear from Applicant\u2019s testimony and credit report how\nmuch she and H3 were credited (if anything) from their return of their leased van (R.T.,\nat 66-67).  \nAfter Applicant, H3 and her children relocated in 2001 (necessitated by H3's duty\nre-assignment), Applicant encountered difficulties finding work in H3's new base\ncommunity (R.T., at 31).  Faced with family income reductions, Applicant and H3 asked\nthe seller to refinance their Mercury purchase to better square their car payments with\ntheir reduced income (R.T., at 31, 46-47).  The seller declined and threatened to\nrepossess the car if they did not make their payments in a timely way (R.T., at 32).  At\nApplicant\u2019s request, the seller repossessed the vehicle in August 2001 and disposed of\nthe vehicle at public auction (R.T., at 46, 76). The seller then billed Applicant for the\nowed deficiency (reported to be $18,959.00 in Applicant\u2019s credit reports and the SOR). \nDepending on whether the $27,297.00 credit ceiling covered in Applicant\u2019s credit\nreports was intended to take account of any and all credits on the lease return, or not,\nApplicant\u2019s reported $18,959.00 deficiency may represent a net figure currently owed by\nApplicant and H3 after accounting for the vehicle\u2019s auction sale.  By Applicant\u2019s\naccounts, she and H3 owed around $18,000.00 on the purchase price of the car and\n\n4\napparently another $9,0000.00 on the rolled in remaining obligation on their van lease\n(R.T., at 69-70).  Between the time they purchased the Mercury vehicle and when the\nseller repossessed it in August 2001, they made little progress in reducing the owed\nprincipal on the vehicle (R.T., at 69, 76).  So, by Applicant\u2019 account, when the vehicle\nwas repossessed, she and H3 still owed about $18,000.00 towards the purchase price\nof the vehicle, and potentially another $9,000.00 on the rolled-in remainder still owed on\ntheir lease agreement. \nApplicant assures she was later informed by the seller that their Mercury\nproduced $9,000.00 at the auction sale, leaving a $9,000.00 deficiency balance on the\npurchase price, which the seller offered to take in full settlement of its deficiency claim\n(R.T., at 69, 81-82).  This offer does not explain, however, what happened to the rolled-\nin $9,000.00 from Applicant\u2019s leased van.  To be sure, Applicant does not seriously\ndispute the government\u2019s theory that the remaining $18,959.00 reported in Applicant\u2019s\ncredit reports and covered in the SOR (admitted) represents the net of the initial\n$27,297.00 credit line on their Mercury purchase, less the $9,000.00 in proceeds\nproduced from the auction sale. She simply could not confirm this version without\naccess to her paperwork from their purchase (R.T., at 76-79).  Whether the seller\u2019s\n$9,000.00 net offer represented the legal state of the account at this time, or simply a\nsettlement offer from the creditor is not clear.  \nWithout any more information in the record to document a lower net figure owing\non Applicant\u2019s repossessed vehicle, the reported sum carried in Applicant\u2019s credit\nreports and not seriously disputed in Applicant\u2019s answer and testimony will be accepted\nas the aggregate net deficiency owed to creditor 1.d after allotting for all credits for\nApplicant\u2019s payments on the account and the sale of the vehicle at public auction. So,\nconsidering all of the circumstances, it is settled that the net deficiency owed by\nApplicant jointly and severally is the $18,859.00 figure drawn from Applicant\u2019s credit\nreports and listed in the SOR (admitted by Applicant).  Applicant still believes, though,\nthat H3 has primary responsibility for the payment of this repossession deficiency, and\nhas undertaken no efforts herself to contact the seller and/or its assignee (R.T., at 48-\n49)\nApplicant holds two other jobs besides her defense job to support herself and her\nfamily.  Since 2004, she has worked as a bartender at a local AF base while trying to\nfind a better job.  She continues her bartending job to provide adequate support for her\nfamily, and holds another job at a base post as a club operations duty manager (R.T., at\n34-37).\nApplicant has some community college education and travel school training\n(R.T., at 36).  She currently receives some child support from H3 for her daughter but\nnothing from H1 for her son.  She did seek child support enforcement of child support\narrears (estimated to be about $10,000.00) owed by H1 for her son), but without any\nnotable success to date (R.T., at 40).\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s earnings have increased some over the past year (R.T., at 50-51).\nBut so have her monthly expenses (R.T., at 51). In September 2007, Applicant\npurchased a 2004 Buick vehicle for around $16,000.00 for transportation to and from\nher prime job and her other two jobs (R.T., at  41, 52-54).  She spends about $312.00 a\nmonth for gas and insurance and $384.00 for her car payment (R.T., at 53-54).  Her\nother monthly debts include her rent (currently $1,300.00), medical expenses for her\ndaughter\u2019s medications that are not covered by her insurance (R.T., at 54), $384.00 a\nmonth for her daughter\u2019s day care, monthly payments on a personal loan ($145.00), and\nsmall monthly payments on several credit card accounts (see ex. 7; R.T., at 54-64).\nShe reports little or no monthly net remainder (ex. 7), and estimates to have about\n$700.00 in her checking account on average.\nApplicant contacted a debt consolidation company to try and reduce her overall\ndebt payments but was told she did not qualify because she does not have at least\n$10,000.00 in unsecured debt (R.T., at 62).  She intends to close her credit card\naccounts after she has paid them off and avoid credit card indebtedness in the future\n(R.T., at 62-63).  She and her children have learned to economize and budget their\nresources (e.g., they have canceled their telephone land lines and internet service) and\nmanage her current finances with her three jobs.  She is currently looking to get a\nroommate to cut her rental expenses.\nApplicant is highly regarded by her program manager who describes her\ncustomer relations and equipment management to be high quality (see ex. A).  He\ncharacterizes her as hard working, honest, dependable, and very conscientious.\nCoworkers describe her as trustworthy, truthful, honest and reliable (see ex. A).  She is\nequally well regarded by operations and senior program analysts who know her\npersonally and professionally since she began her current employment 14 months ago\n(ex. A).   \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n\n6\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a highly regarded equipment attendant for a defense contractor who\naccumulated several delinquent debts following her separation and divorce from H3 in\n2004.  Three of the four debts are relatively small and have since been paid.  The last\ndebt is considerably larger (around $9,000.00 still owing on a deficiency balance\nfollowing a repossession and public sale of the vehicle), and remains unpaid.  Three of\n\n7\nthe four listed debts are medically-related and have since been paid by Applicant.\nWithout resolution, though, her remaining car deficiency raises security significant\nconcerns.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and her past inability to pay  these debts warrant the application of two\nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines\u00b6 DC 19(a), inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts, and \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to her divorces and ensuing single\nparenting with little help from her ex-husbands.  She has been working three jobs to\nmake ends meet and make sure her family is cared for.  Records reflect that she is\nmanaging to keep current with her most recent creditors, and has since paid all but one\nof her listed creditors.  Only the $18,959.00 settled deficiency on the Mercury vehicle she\nand H3 purchased in 1999 remains unpaid.  The seller repossessed this vehicle in 2001\nand sold it at public auction (leaving the settled deficiency balance of $18.959.00).  This\ncreditor has mounted no enforcement efforts to collect this debt from Applicant, and\nshows no signs of doing so in the foreseeable future  With a family to support as a single\nparent since 2004, and reliance on three jobs to support her family, she continues to\nstruggle to stay current with her debts and expenses.  Faced with so many pressing\nchallenges to keep her family together, she has succeeded in not only favorably\nimpressing her supervisors and coworkers at work, but she has been able to say current\nwith her monthly debts and expenses. \nBased on her evidentiary showing, extenuating circumstances are associated with\nApplicant\u2019s inability to take care of past medical debs and vehicle deficiency.  Available\nto Applicant is \u00b6 MC 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation, and the individual acted responsibility,\u201d has some applicability to Applicant\u2019\nsituation.  Albeit, some judgment problems persist over the amount she and H3 jointly\nexpended on a late model car in 1999 without certain available resources to sustain their\nagreed monthly payments, she satisfied that her separation and divorce from H3 was\nunanticipated at the time and not indicative of any manifest judgment lapses on her part. \nBecause of the limited income available to Applicant over the past five years, she\nhas not heretofore been in a position to address her large deficiency balance with\ncreditor 1.d (disputed in amount or obligation or otherwise).  This creditor has made no\ncollection demands on Applicant in the past four years at least, and there is no evidence\nthat Applicant has ever reaffirmed the debt.  Based on this record, Applicant\u2019s covered\ndeficiency debt with creditor 1.d appears to be barred from collection by the pertinent\n\n8\nfour-year statute of limitation in her state.  See CCP \u00a7\u00a7 337 (stating suit on written\nobligations must be filed within four years) and 343 (stating suit for which no period\npreviously provided must be filed within four years).\nStatutes of limitation, while considered important policy tools for discouraging\nplaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation, have never been\nequated with good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No.\n02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd.\nJune 2001).   Still, they provide effective collection barriers and, like bankruptcy, serve to\ninsulate the debtor from pressures to raise cash to satisfy his or her creditors.\nTo be sure, Applicant does not assert relevant state statutes of limitation in her\ndefense.  With her limited income she has had difficulty making individual or collective\nprogress in paying the remaining car debt, and continues to look to H3 for payment of\nthe debt as the principal obligor.  At this time it is not clear what steps Applicant might\nconsider in the foreseeable future, if any, to resolve this debt with her limited resources.\nIf this creditor (creditor 1.c) is not willing to detail pertinent debits and credits with the\ncredit reporting agencies or otherwise provide Applicant with an historical accounting of\nher assumed obligations, credits and debts, then it is pretty clear that this creditor is not\ninterested in the debt or Applicant\u2019s working to pay it off.  At this time, she is legally\ninsulated from any collection action by applicable state statutes of limitation, and for all\npracticable purposes, is no longer at risk to having to raise large sums of money to\nresolve her debts.  \nMitigation credit is also available to Applicant based on her credible proofs of\ngood faith repayment efforts and good-faith disputes with two of her medical creditors\n(over Tricare coverage).  Age of each of the covered debts is covered by two of the\nmitigating conditions for financial considerations: \u00b6 MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d\nhas applicability, while not dispositive.  \u00b6 MC 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d has some applicability as\nwell.\n                                                    \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment permits mitigation of Applicant\u2019s accumulated\ndelinquent debts.  Extenuating circumstances associated with her husband\u2019s abandoning\nher and leaving her to care for herself and her children without medical insurance are the\nprincipal source of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies. Judgment lapses do not play any material\nrole in her debt accumulations.  Since her separation and divorce, she has done all she\n\n9\ncould be reasonably expected to do to pay her debts and responsibly care for her\nchildren\u2019s needs  She has worked three jobs to support her family and, with the\nexception of the vehicle deficiency that is time barred, she has paid her old debts and is\ncurrent with her new ones.  Her good judgment and trustworthiness draw reinforcement\nfrom her program manager and senior operations and program analysts who work\nclosely with her and attest to her strong character.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources she has had to address them with,\nher documented steps taken to resolve them, the responsibility and trustworthiness she\nis credited with in her work and personal life as a struggling single parent, and the statute\nof limitation protections now available to her, she mitigates judgment and trustworthiness\nconcerns related to her debts.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by the financial considerations guideline.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n                                          \nRoger C.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) alleged five delinquent debts, totaling \nabout $45,000. One SOR debt duplicated another SOR debt, and her proven delinquent \nSOR debt actually totaled about $33,000. She did not make any payments for more \nthan a year or otherwise establish any track record of debt resolution of these four \ndelinquent SOR debts. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. Department Counsel withdrew the personal conduct allegation. Eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 10, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On September 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to her,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 7 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated September 29, 2008). GE 7 is \nthe source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \nDecember 23, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR alleges \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal \nConduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \nOn October 28, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing (GE 8). Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on \nNovember 17, 2008, and on that same date the case was assigned to me. At the \nhearing held on December 11, 2008, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GEs 1-\n5) (Transcript (Tr.) 18), and Applicant offered three exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE A-\nC) (Tr. 34). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE A (Tr. 18, 34-35). \nAdditionally, I admitted a Hearing Notice (GE 6), the SOR (GE 7), and Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the SOR (GE 8). I received the transcript on December 19, 2008.   \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that on July 20, 2008, Applicant indicated in a letter that she \nwas abandoning her attempt to obtain a security clearance because security clearance \njudgments are unfair and discriminatory against the working people of the United \nStates. Department Counsel made a motion to withdraw this allegation, the Applicant \ndid not object, and I granted the motion (Tr. 13). This allegation will not receive further \ndiscussion in this decision. \n \n \nThe SOR and the SOR response contain five identical subparagraphs under \nparagraph 1, except the SOR subparagraphs are incorrectly numbered in the SOR \nresponse (GE 7, 8). The SOR response lacks any subparagraph 1.d and there is a \nsubparagraph 1.f (GE 8). I changed SOR \u00b6 1.e to 1.d and SOR \u00b6 1.f to 1.e and initialed \nthe changes in the SOR response (GE 8). \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the five SOR \ndelinquent debts totaling about $45,000 (GE 8). Her admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I \nmake the following findings of fact.    \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

She has focused her classes on geometrics, which involves geography, \ninformation systems and using remote sense data to prepare maps for the national \ngeospatial industry (Tr. 20). She is taking courses to improve her employability and \nincrease her income (Tr. 20). A subcontractor to her current employer provided her \nemployment from late 2003 to 2005 (Tr. 28). She has never served in the military (GE \n1). A government contractor has employed her in the geospatial area since 2005 (Tr. \n21, 28). Her security application did not disclose a police record or a felony conviction. \nHer record has no indication of illegal drug abuse or mental disability or instability. She \nhas never left employment under adverse circumstances. When she completed her \n2007 SF 86, she disclosed the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e and several non-\nSOR delinquent debts. On September 10, 2007, she promised to rectify her debts and \npay monies owed to her creditors (GE 1).  \n  \nApplicant admitted responsibility for all five delinquent SOR debts, totaling about \n$45,000. Her last contact with the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e was in 2005 \n(Tr. 24-25). Her last contact with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d was in November 2007 (Tr. \n24-25).

Applicant\u2019s husband owns their residence, \nand Applicant pays him part of her income (Tr. 30). She is unaware of her husband\u2019s \nfinancial status (Tr. 30). Around 1994, Applicant and her husband agreed to keep \nseparate accounts and separate debts (Tr. 32). The SOR debts were solely Applicant\u2019s \ndebts (Tr. 32). Because Applicant was in a military family, there were frequent moves \n(Tr. 23).

Recently her 1989 Toyota ceased operation for mechanical reasons, \nand she has not decided whether to try to have it repaired (Tr. 31).  \n \nApplicant did not disclose financial counseling. Applicant\u2019s plan to resolve her \ndelinquent debts was to wait until the economy stabilized; then she intends to borrow \nenough money to pay her debts (Tr. 25). She insisted that she wanted to pay all of her \ndebts (Tr. 25).   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \n\n \n \n6 \n \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  \n.  .  .  . SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of \ndelinquent debt is documented in her credit report, her 2007 security clearance \napplication and her SOR response. Applicant\u2019s SOR alleged five delinquent debts, \ntotaling about $45,000. One SOR debt duplicated another SOR debt, and her actual \ndelinquent debt load is about $33,000. She admitted responsibility for the four \ndelinquent debts. She did not make any payments for more than a year or otherwise \nestablish any track record of debt resolution of these four SOR debts. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \u201cOnce a concern \narises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 \n(9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has raised financial considerations security \nconcerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating \nconditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.       \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of any mitigating conditions. Her \nfinancial problems are not isolated because she currently has four delinquent debts \ntotaling about $33,000. The ongoing nature of her delinquent debts is \u201ca continuing \ncourse of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, \n2002)). Moreover, I am not convinced her debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the [her] current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Although she has been paying some of her non-\nSOR debts, she has failed to pay anything towards her SOR debts even though she has \nbeen steadily employed for more than four years.   \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant\u2019s unemployment from August 2001 to July 2002 \nresulted in multiple debts. As such, some of her debts are due to forces beyond her \ncontrol. However, she did not provide sufficient information to establish that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or made sufficient efforts to address her \ndelinquent debts, especially those debts which remained delinquent even though she \nhas been steadily employed for at least four years.4 She admitted that she has not \nmaintained contact with her SOR creditors, and made very limited efforts to pay the four \ndelinquent SOR debts.     \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant did not disclose financial \ncounseling. There are no indications that \u201cthat the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol\u201d because the amount of delinquent debt has been unchanged for more than a \nyear. There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith5 in \n \n4\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nthe resolution of her delinquent SOR debts because she did not establish that her \nfailure to pay her delinquent debts was reasonable and necessary under the \ncircumstances. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant did not dispute her responsibility \nfor any debts. I conclude Applicant\u2019s overall conduct in regard to her delinquent debts \ncasts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. She failed to \nresolve or make payments to four creditors to whom she owed substantial debts. She \npromised to pay two of her SOR creditors in her 2007 SF 86, and did not do so. She did \nnot provide good cause for her failure to set up payment plans and make some \npayments despite having an opportunity to do so. Based on my evaluation of the record \nevidence as a whole, I conclude financial considerations are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nThere is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole \nperson concept. Her dedication to her work and her country is a very positive indication \nof her good character and trustworthiness. She improved her employability and \nprospects for greater income through her continuing education efforts. Her 3.8 grade \n \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n9 \n \npoint average is particularly impressive. She is completely loyal to her country. \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment and law-abiding character weigh in her favor. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation, or criminal activity. Her non-SOR debts \nare current and being paid. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and \nmitigation.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative \nguidelines are not sufficient to warrant access to classified information. The overall \namount of unresolved debt is about $33,000 and substantial. She has been \ncontinuously employed for more than four years (with income ranging from $23,991 to \n$29,663 for the period 2005 to 2007), and did not establish that she lacked the funds to \narrange and begin payment plans. She promised to pay two SOR debts in 2007 on her \nsecurity clearance application and failed to fulfill her promise. Applicant has been aware \nof the security significance of her delinquent SOR debts since she received the SOR in \nOctober 2008, and she did not take any material actions to resolve her delinquent \ndebts. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.      \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nWITHDRAWN \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nWithdrawn \n\n \n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 22, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 18, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings are supported\n\nApplicant disagrees with the Judge\u2019s statement that Applicant had discovered she needed additional surgery\n1\nin early 2008, whereas she states that she found she needed it in 2000 and for a reason different from that cited by the\nJudge.  Even if Applicant had explained this earlier, it would not have changed the result here.  \nby relevant evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nSpecifically, Applicant points out factual errors in the Judge\u2019s decision.  Applicant also argues that\nthe Judge should have found her financial situation to be mitigated.   \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  The SOR alleges 10 debts totaling\n$16,984.  Prior to the hearing, Applicant admitted to three of the debts.  She denied the others\nbecause she said she did not recognize the names of the creditors after the debts were sold to\ncollection agencies.  At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged the other debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began after a serious car accident in December 1997, which\ncaused her to lose her job.  After an orthopedic surgeon inserted metal plates and screws in her limbs,\nhe advised her to file for disability because arthritis would eventually prevent her from working.\nApplicant tried to find a job that would allow her to work in a seated position.  She found such a job\nin early 2000, but lost it when the company was sold in February 2002.  Applicant began receiving\nSocial Security Disability benefits in March 2003.  While Applicant was unemployed, she lived with\ndifferent relatives for periods of time.  Applicant found an apartment in 2003, although her income\nis not enough to pay her rent and her living expenses.   At times, Applicant  has received assistance\nfrom her sons and her sister to help her pay her expenses.  \nSometime in or after September 2007, Applicant began working part-time at a job which\ncould accommodate her medical situation.  She had to stop working in May 2008 when her interim\nsecurity clearance was rescinded.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor and the head of human resources at that\njob testified on her behalf.  \nIn her appeal, Applicant identifies statements in the Judge\u2019s decision which she considers to\nbe erroneous.  In explaining why some of the statements are incorrect, Applicant presents\ninformation which was not presented previously.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on\nappeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings of security concern are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable\ncharacterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the record.  Applicant has not identified any\nharmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.   Considering the record evidence as a whole,\n1\nthe Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05434\nat 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2009).\nIn her appeal, Applicant also argues that the Judge did not give adequate weight to her\nmitigating evidence.  The Judge referred to Applicant\u2019s testimony and discussed the possible\napplication of mitigating conditions in Applicant\u2019s case.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\n\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (May 23, 2008).  The record\nsupports the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s financial situation.\nApplicant states that the hearing upset her and made her feel like a criminal.  While Applicant\npresented an explanation for her current financial difficulties, the Judge found that explanation\ninsufficient to support a security clearance at this time.  The Judge\u2019s decision is not a reflection on\nApplicant\u2019s character.  \nAfter reviewing the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

She had to stop working in May 2008 when her interim security clearance was rescinded. Applicant\u2019s supervisor and the head of human resources at that job testified on her behalf. In her appeal, Applicant identifies statements in the Judge\u2019s decision which she considers to be erroneous. In explaining why some of the statements are incorrect, Applicant presents information which was not presented previously. The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the record. Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case. Considering the record evidence as a whole, 1 the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05434 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2009). In her appeal, Applicant also argues that the Judge did not give adequate weight to her mitigating evidence. The Judge referred to Applicant\u2019s testimony and discussed the possible application of mitigating conditions in Applicant\u2019s case. The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached",

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA) on August 27,\n2007. On May 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on June 4, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on August 19, 2008, and the hearing was held on September 10,\n2008. At the hearing, six exhibits (GE 1 through 4, GE 6 and 7) were admitted in\nevidence without objection to support the government\u2019s case. GE 5 was marked for\nidentification (Tr. 22); the exhibit was not admitted in evidence because (1) it is\nirrelevant to the allegations of the SOR, and (2) Applicant testified she has never been\nDecember 18, 2008\n\n2\nto the state cited in GE 5 (Tr. 150). Applicant  testified and submitted four exhibits (AE\nA-AE D). In the time allowed for Applicant to furnish additional documentation, she\nsubmitted AE E through AE H. These exhibits contain partial payment receipts to\nmedical providers, and letters to creditors telling them she cannot pay the debt and/or to\ndiscontinue contacting her about the debt. DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the\nproceedings on September 19, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges 10 debts (nine delinquent debts and one judgment) totaling\n$16,984.00. The debts converted to delinquent status between 2001 and December\n2007. Applicant admitted subparagraphs 1.f., 1.i., and 1.k. She denied the other seven\ndebts. Her denials of the remaining debts resulted from not recognizing the accounts\nafter they were sold to collection agencies with different names. During the hearing, she\nacknowledged the other listed accounts are her responsibility. \nApplicant is 62 years old. Her second marriage ended in divorce in June 1984.\nShe has three sons, 46, 44, and 38 years of age. She seeks a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s financial troubles began in December 1997 when she lost her job\nafter a serious car accident left her with broken arms and legs. Surgery, including the\ninsertion of metal plates and screws, was required to facilitate proper healing.\nApplicant\u2019s orthopedic surgeon advised her to file for disability because arthritis would\neventually demobilize her. Over the next two or three years, she struggled to find a job\nthat would allow her to work in a seated position. She found employment in early 2000\nallowing her to work in a seated position, but was terminated when the business was\nsold in February 2002. Applicant began receiving Social Security Disability payments in\nMarch 2003 (Tr. 95). She was unable to find employment until she was hired at her\npresent job in September 2007. \nBetween February 2002 and September 2007, she lived with different relatives\nuntil she moved into her own apartment some time in 2003. Currently, after subtracting\nall her expenses from her monthly disability check of $1,109.00, she has a negative\nmonthly remainder of approximately $619.00 (Tr. 143). Applicant has received\nassistance from her sons and her sister to help her pay her expenses. \nWhen Applicant discovered she needed additional surgery in early 2008 to\nremove the metal plate and screws from her leg, she stated, \u201cI started looking for a job\nso I could get some additional insurance to help pay for the surgery I needed. I found\nthis job that hires disable[d] senior citizens at [current employer]. This job was\nterminated in April 2008 (AE A).\u201d Applicant asserts that a reasonable accommodation\nbe made under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to permit her to continue her\nemployment with her current employer (AE B). \n\n3\nThe head of human resources, who also serves as facility security officer (FSO)\nfor the employer, explained that 75% of the company\u2019s employees have disability issues\n(Tr. 37). She initiated the background security check on Applicant, and also participated\nin Applicant\u2019s job interview before she was hired in September 2007 to work part-time\n(Tr. 30). The FSO has had no complaints about Applicant\u2019s work (Tr. 31). While the\nFSO testified Applicant has been employed since September 2007, there is no evidence\nin the record indicating where Applicant was employed or what her job duties were\nbetween September 2007 and March 2008. \nApplicant\u2019s second witness supervised Applicant from March to May 2008.\nApplicant had to stop work in May 2008 when her interim security clearance was\nrescinded. She also underwent additional surgery to remove the metal plate and screws\nfrom her leg, recommends her for a position of trust based on the excellent rapport she\nhas developed at her job as a receptionist at the crime lab (Tr. 47). Applicant\u2019s\nexemplary job performance is the primary reason her supervisor provided testimonial\nsupport for her (Tr. 55). \nRegarding the debts listed in the SOR, Applicant presented no evidence of\nrepayment. She provided four receipts of partial payments on medical accounts, but it is\nimpossible to determine whether the payments apply to either of the two listed medical\naccounts (subparagraphs 1.f. and 1.g.) or other unlisted medical debts. She believes\nthe past due account ($10,522.00) in subparagraph 1.h. is a credit card she had at the\ntime of her auto accident in December 1997. The state lien of $726.00 (subparagraph\n1.h.) was imposed in October 2007 (GE 4) because Applicant did not pay taxes on the\nunemployment compensation she received over the years. She did not know she had to\npay taxes on unemployment benefits she received (Tr. 74).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt  concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\n\n4\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nThe credit bureau reports reflect that since 2001 Applicant has accumulated 10\ndelinquent accounts (nine delinquent debts and one judgment) totaling almost\n$17,000.00. FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) apply based on the\nage of the debts, and the fact they have not been paid. \nThe record reflects Applicant was involved in a very serious automobile accident\nin December 1997. As a result of her injuries, she could no longer work standing for any\nlengthy period of time. She encountered periods of unemployment until she found a job\nin early 2000. She lost that job in February 2002, and was unemployed until she found\nemployment with her current employer in September 2007. Since February 2002,\n\n5\nApplicant has been receiving unemployment benefits, financial and shelter help from\nher relatives and Social Security Disability. \nThere are four mitigating conditions (MC) that have potential application to this\ncase. FC mitigating condition (MC) 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment) cannot\nbe applied as Applicant still owes the debts even though the account in subparagraph\n1.h. should probably be removed by the limitations statutes defining the period of time a\ncreditor has to recover on a delinquent credit card debt. Applicant \u2019s debts are likely to\npersist, however, even if the subparagraph 1.h. account were removed for time\nlimitation purposes. \nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control and individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\napplies based on the serious car accident in December 1997, and employment\nproblems Applicant encountered since then because of her disability. \nConversely, neither FC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control) nor FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) apply. There is no indication\nApplicant has her financial problems under control. Though she has made partial\npayments on some medical accounts, she has not addressed any of the SOR accounts,\nnot even the medical account for $10.00. Applicant has not met her burden of\npersuasion under the FC guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s\nlife, and a careful consideration of nine variables that comprise whole person model:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation and recurrence. \u00b6 2, p.18 of\nthe Directive.\nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all facts\nand circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the general factors of the whole\nperson model. It is clear Applicant suffered serious injuries in her car accident in\nDecember 1997 that she has not fully recovered from. Since then, she has encountered\n\n6\nproblems finding a job. While there is testimony she began working at her current\nemployer in September 2007, her supervisor provided the only direct knowledge of her\nemployment. I am not minimizing the financial impact of the car accident and\nsubsequent periods of unemployment. I have concluded however, that the character\naccolades from her supervisor addressing Applicant\u2019s two months of employment from\nMarch to May 2008 do not outweigh her continuing financial problems. Having\nconsidered this case under the general factors of the whole person concept, Applicant\u2019s\naccess for classified information is denied. \nApplicant raises an issue that warrants discussion. First, her contention that a\nreasonable accommodation be made under ADA for her disability so she can continue\nher employment has been addressed by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 99-\n0068 (November 30, 1999). The federal government is excluded from ADA coverage by\n42 USC 1211(5)(B) (Id. at 5). Second, my adverse decision is not based on Applicant\u2019s\ndisability, but on her continuing financial problems and insufficient track record of job\nperformance and financial responsibility. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating security concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on June 24, 2008, Applicant admitted four of the five\nallegations raised concerning five allegedly delinquent debts. She also requested a\nhearing. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s request on July 9, 2008, and I was assigned the\ncase on July 10, 2008. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to an August 13,\n2008, hearing date, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on July 17, 2008, to that effect.\nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n Applicant noted: \u201cMy husband liked to use credit cards.\u201d Tr. 30.\n1\n2\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted six exhibits\n(Ex.), accepted into the record as Exs. 1-6 without objection. Applicant was\naccompanied by a friend and represented by counsel. She gave testimony. No\nwitnesses were called and no exhibits were offered into evidence. Applicant was given\nthrough August 20, 2008, to submit any additional materials. After the hearing, on\nAugust 13, 2008, three additional exhibits were submitted by Applicant through counsel\nvia facsimile transmission. They were accepted into the record as exhibits (Exs.) A-C.\nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on August 19, 2008, and the record was closed on\nAugust 22, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security\nclearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a government contractor. She has a\nbackground in finance and accounting with significant past employment as a Director of\nAccounting and Accounting Manager. Applicant completed one year of college. She is\nseparated from her husband of four years, who lives in a distant state, and she recently\nfiled for divorce. \nIn 1995, Applicant started work as an hourly wage employee for a hotel chain.\nShe worked her way up until she was named Director of Accounting in 2001, earning\napproximately $100,000 per year. By 2003, she was making about $150,000. With\nbonuses, this sum was closer to $200,000 per year. In late 2003, the chain looked like it\nmight be vulnerable to a merger. Managers were assured their positions would be safe.\nOne day in February 2004, however, many upper level employees, including Applicant,\nwere told that they were to be let go effective that day and to leave the building. After a\ndecade of relatively stable employment, Applicant was stunned. She left the building\nthat day with her possessions and was paid $110,000 in severance compensation. \nApplicant states that she was \u201cin shock\u201d for six months following her February\n2004 termination. In July 2004, she married her current husband. A self-employed\nconstruction worker, he was unemployed at the time. She remained unemployed,\nreceiving $350 a month in unemployment compensation. She then found work as an\naccounting manager in December 2004. The job paid approximately $15 per hour. On\nthis salary, she became the couple\u2019s primary provider.\nWhen Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2005, she had approximately\n$67,000 in delinquent debt.  She did not include her mortgages or automobiles in the\n1\nbankruptcy petition. That petition was discharged in September 2005.\nIn 2007, Applicant became delinquent on mortgage payments on a first and a\nsecond mortgage for a house she and her husband had purchased. That same year,\nApplicant and her husband separated in February 2007. By March 2007, she had\nmoved to another state to accept a position paying about $80,000. She accepted the\n\nTr. 20.\n2\n Tr. 36.\n3\n See Interrogatories.\n4\n Tr. 22.\n5\n Tr. 33.\n6\n Id.\n7\n3\nposition and the move in part to get away from her husband, who \u201chas a temper and I\njust wanted to get out of the state.\u201d  She sold her car for a model with less expensive\n2\nmonthly payments.  Since he would remain living in the house, her husband agreed to\n3\nassume payments on the mortgage. In a letter dated January 10, 2008, Applicant was\nsurprised to hear he had stopped paying the mortgages. The bank also informed\nApplicant that the house had been in a foreclosure sale. The sale covered the amount\nof the mortgage, so Applicant was relieved from future obligations on the first mortgage.\nOn January 15, 2008, the holder of a second mortgage informed Applicant she\nwas seriously past due on her payments on a principal of about $17,524 with interest of\n$3.75 accruing each day. The mortgagor demanded payment within 10 days of the\nletter\u2019s date. A subsequent letter, dated March 26, 2008, demanded full payment on the\nmortgage by April 5, 2008, in the amount of $17,550.31. In response to that letter,\nApplicant entered into a repayment plan. Under the plan, she would pay $400 by April\n30, 2008. She timely made the $400 payment.  That initial payment was followed by\n4\nmonthly payments of $200, starting on May 25, 2008. Applicant is currently in timely\nrepayment on this debt. Her last payment was on August 11, 2008. \nSince her move in 2007, Applicant\u2019s salary has risen to $82,000 per year. She\nrented a more expensive apartment for $1,800 because it allowed pets. Her pets have\nsince died. To compensate, she took in a roommate for four months who paid $500 per\nmonth. Her landlady recently reduced the rent to $1,500 per month. She is now looking\nfor a less expensive apartment. Her regular bills include cable television service, a\nphone service, car payments and insurance, and credit card bills. She is current on her\neveryday expenses and monthly bills. Applicant considered financial counseling, but\ndecided against it: \u201cI can make my credit card payments currently, and in my mind as\nlong as I can make above the minimum payment and try to pay [debts] off, that\u2019s what\nI\u2019m trying to do. . . .\u201d   \n5\nApplicant currently has a little over $11,000 in credit card debt and is making\napproximately $500 a month in payments.  Her monthly payments are expected to\n6\nincrease once she has made adjustments for her recently lowered rent. Presently, she\nis current on her six credit cards.  She feels she has made adjustments which make her\n7\ncapable of living within her $80,000 salary.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n8\n Department of the Navy v.

Jan. 27, 1995).\n10\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n8\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n9\n10\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\n\n Id.\n11\n Id.\n12\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n14\n5\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n12\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n13\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n14\nunder this guideline.  \nIn February 2004, Applicant found herself abruptly released from a highly\nlucrative position. She received $110,000 in severance pay and remained unemployed\nfor 10 months. During that time she married an unemployed man. In May 2005, she\nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, having accumulated a little over $67,000 in debt. Since\nthen she has had a home foreclosed upon and a second mortgagor demand payment\nin full of her balance. She also concedes she has over $10,000 in credit card debt not\nnoted in the SOR. Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC\nDC) AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a)\n(\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) apply. With such conditions raised, the\nburden shifts to Appellant to overcome the case against her and mitigate security\nconcerns. \nDespite assurances her job was secure, Applicant was let go from her $200,000\njob without notice in February 2004. Her loss of employment was clearly beyond her\ncontrol. What is less clear is how she went through any cash reserves she might have\n\n See ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006).\n15\n6\nhad as of the time she was terminated, a $110,000 severance check, and built up about\n67,000 in mostly credit card debt in about a year. Applicant failed to explain how this\nmoney was expended while acting in a responsible manner. On its face, however, it\nseems as if her expenditures while unemployed continued on in much the same\nmanner as they had when she was still earning $200,000. Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition (FC MC) 2, AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) does not apply.\nWhen Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection, she utilized a commonly used\nand legally available method for addressing her debts and starting anew. Therefore,\nshe cannot be slighted for that. It was her estranged husband who chose to continue\nliving in their home and assume the mortgages\u2019 payments, but who ultimately\nabandoned that obligation without advanced warning to Applicant. Luckily, no balance\nwas due after the home was sold at auction. The only current issue regarding Applicant\nand overdue debts concerns her second mortgage. \nApplicant became seriously delinquent on her second mortgage. Working with\nthe bank, she entered into a repayment plan under which an initial payment of $400\nwas submitted in April 2008. Since then, monthly payments of $200 have been made\nregularly. To date, she is current on this plan. Although a rate of $200 a month is\nrelatively minimal, it is acceptable to the bank, reduces her obligation by about $1,200,\nand helps represent meaningful debt reduction .  Given her good faith efforts toward\n15\nworking out a repayment plan and five months of timely repayment by the time the\nrecord closed, FC MC 4, AG \u00b6 20(d), (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) applies. Moreover, although she has not\nreceived credit counseling, her efforts to address her second mortgage and live within\nher budget do reflect a financial situation that is under currently under control. FC MC 3,\nAG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d)\napplies to her sole unresolved obligation. No other mitigating conditions apply.\nInasmuch as Applicant has presented mitigating conditions with regard to how her\ndebts have arisen and shown how she has addressed the mortgage her husband\nneglected, she has mitigated financial considerations security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n\n7\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature, self-made woman, who has seen her share of economic\nups and downs over the span of her career. A particularly rocky five year period\nappears to have recently closed. She is once again steadily employed and making a\nrespectable salary given her experience and past employment. She is soon to be\ndivorced from a husband she has supported since their 2004 marriage. She is living\nwithin her means. She understands the dangers of only paying minimum payments on\ncredit cards, just as she has learned the importance of staying timely on her bills. \nAfter Applicant demonstrated that she has an established plan to pay off her\nsecond mortgage and that she has taken significant actions to implement that plan,\nDepartment Counsel noted he was also troubled with the fact Applicant admits she\ncurrently has over $10,000 in credit card debt. His concern is understandable. It was\nprimarily credit card debt that led Applicant from a $110,000 severance package to\nabout $67,000 in debt within a year that led to her bankruptcy. Today, however,\nApplicant is no longer responsible for her husband, who seems to have had a problem\nwith credit card use. As well, she is thus far able to timely pay more than her minimum\npayments due to her creditors. Therefore, although her judgment could appear even\nsounder if she would seek financial counseling, it cannot be said she is presently living\nbeyond her means, not meeting her obligations under her credit cards\u2019 terms,\nexercising poor judgment, or otherwise demonstrating an unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations. Moreover, Applicant knows well what will happen with her\nsecurity clearance should she again let her debts become delinquent. Therefore, with\nsecurity concerns thus mitigated, I conclude it is clearly consistent with national security\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On June 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines H and E\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 19, 2008. He requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on July 11,\n2008. Applicant was available in September for a hearing. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on September 3, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September\n23, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1-4, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and did not submit any exhibits for the\nOctober 21, 2008\n\n2\nrecord. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 30, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, received June 19, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c of the SOR. He denied the allegation in \u00b6 2.a. He also\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1972 and completed college in 1983. He is divorced and has no children.\nHe held a Q security clearance (equivalent to a top secret) from 1993 until 1999 while\nemployed in a federal agency. He has worked in a professional capacity in the software\nengineering field for his entire career. He has been with his current employer since\nAugust 2007 (GE 1).\nApplicant used marijuana when he was in high school and college. He also\nsmoked with his wife and friends either at parties or when camping as an adult. He\nsmoked the illegal drug from approximately 1972 until at least January 1993 on average\nabout 20 times per year (Tr. 30). Applicant maintains that he stopped using marijuana\nwhen he held a Q clearance during his federal employment.\nIn 1993, Applicant decided that he would no longer use marijuana. He believed\nthe use of marijuana was \u201cno big deal\u201d but would stop so that he could obtain a security\nclearance. He felt he had no real need to use marijuana. He admitted that if it were not\na bar to a security clearance, he would use marijuana (Tr. 23).\nApplicant also used cocaine twice in 1984 or 1986. He wanted to experiment with\nthe illegal drug (Tr. 27). Applicant also recalls that someone left marijuana in his car in\n1987 or 1988 when he gave them a ride (Tr. 40-41).\nIn August and September 2000, Applicant again used marijuana for a short\nperiod of time. He smoked marijuana approximately eight times either by himself or with\nhis girlfriend (GE 4). He maintains that he found the marijuana while biking on a trail (Tr.\n31). The marijuana was in a film cannister in the middle of the road according to\nApplicant. He smoked the marijuana when he returned home. He purchased a pipe so\nthat he could smoke the marijuana (Tr. 33). He smoked the marijuana because he was\n\u201crebelling.\u201d He acknowledged that since he did not smoke marijuana while he had a\nsecurity clearance, he would try it again. He did not like the control of the Department of\nDefense (DoD) drug policy (Tr. 34-35). He believes marijuana should be legalized. He\nbelieves it is a personal choice (Tr. 22).    \nApplicant stated he again found marijuana in 2007. He was driving his car on the\nhighway and a backpack fell from a bike that was in front of his car. He pulled his car to\n\n3\nthe side of the road and picked up the pack. He could not catch up with the biker. At that\npoint Applicant took the pack home. When he opened it, he found that a pipe and some\nmarijuana were inside the pack. He decided to smoke the marijuana the next night (Tr.\n38). \nApplicant experienced a racing of his heart when he smoked the \u201cfound\u201d\nmarijuana in 2007. He felt as though he were having a heart attack. He went to the\nemergency room at the hospital. He does not want to use marijuana again because it\nmade him feel really sick (Tr. 41). He also does not want to smoke it again because it\nhas caused him so much \u201cgrief.\u201d\nAt the hearing, Applicant explained he still associates with people who use drugs.\nHe brought a friend to his house in the summer of 2008 because the friend was\nstranded. His friend had marijuana with him and smoked it when he was in Applicant\u2019s\nhome (Tr. 57).\nIn April 2008, Applicant answered written interrogatories concerning use of any\nnarcotics. He answered \u201cyes.\u201d He then listed his 2000 and 2007 use of marijuana, the\nfrequency of use, and the average quantity (GE 3). He declared he had no intention to\nuse marijuana again because he had a bad experience in 2007. He did not list the use\nof marijuana in 1972 until at least 1993.    \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that he denied any intent to deceive the\ngovernment. He stated the government has no evidence that he intentionally omitted\nany information. He assumed that the government had his information concerning the\n1972 to 1993 drug use from earlier forms and investigations. He believed the\ngovernment would have a paper trail and that his answer to the question on the 2008\ninterrogatory was answered correctly. He would answer the question the same way if\nasked again. He explained the earlier information was freely obtainable by the\ngovernment. He believes the government\u2019s question was misleading in its wording. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\n\n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug\n\n5\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is also potentially disqualifying.\nApplicant admitted his use of marijuana from 1972 until at least January 1993. He also\nadmitted to using it again in 2000 and 2007 for a period of time. He used cocaine once\nor twice in 1986. \nUnder AG \u00b6 25(g) \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance\u201d\nis a disqualifying condition. Applicant used marijuana in 2000 and 2007 after he had a\nsecurity clearance from an earlier time. Granted, he did not have a clearance in 2000\nbut he resorted to illegal drug use again after once having an earlier clearance.\nexamination. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\n2007 use of marijuana and his explanations that he found the marijuana on two\nseparate occasions are not credible and casts doubts on his trustworthiness, reliability\nand judgment. I do not find that this mitigating condition applies.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where Aa demonstrated intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d This is not a factor for consideration in this\ncase for the reasons discussed above.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\n\n6\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\nI have considered all the facts and find Applicant deliberately omitted, concealed,\nmisled, and falsified information in his April 8, 2008 interrogatories with respect to his\nmarijuana use from 1972 until 1993. Applicant is not credible in his explanations or\nreasoning about the question. He is not credible in his explanations that he found the\nmarijuana on two different occasions. Nor is he credible in his statement that he does\nnot intend to use any illegal drug in the future. His only expressed reason for not using\nmarijuana any more is because it made him sick in 2007. He also made a commitment\nin 1993 and did not keep that promise. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, I find that none of\nthem apply in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well-educated\nprofessional. He held a Q clearance for years when employed with a federal agency. He\nserved in a professional capacity for his entire career. He has a long history of smoking\nmarijuana. His decision to stop using the illegal drug in 1993 was solely based on\nobtaining a security clearance. His expressed resolve to not use an illegal drug again\nwas broken in 2000 and 2007. His explanation that he found the marijuana is not\ncredible. His recent decision to stop using marijuana because he became ill and that it\nhas caused him problems is not sufficient to mitigate the drug involvement guideline. \nApplicant was not credible in his explanation concerning his omission of the 1972\nto 1993 marijuana use when answering his 2008 interrogatories. His reasoning that the\ngovernment did not have any evidence about his intentional omission and that he knew\nthe government could obtain this information from his previous forms and investigations\ndoes not mitigate the personal conduct guideline.\n\n7\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines H (Drug \nInvolvement) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 6, 2007. On \nMay 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 19, 2008; answered it on \nJune 3, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received \nthe request on June 4, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 12, \n2008, and the case was assigned to me on July 29, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on July 30, 2008, scheduling the hearing for August 25, 2008. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented the testimony of three \nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were admitted \nwithout objection. The record closed upon adjournment of the hearing. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on September 3, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations under Guideline H \nand denied the allegations under Guideline E. His admissions in his answer and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old systems engineer for a federal contractor. He earned a \nbachelor of science degree in physics and chemistry in 2002 (AX B) and a M.B.A. in \nSeptember 2006 (AX C). He has worked for his current employer since October 2007. \nHe has never held a security clearance.  \n \n \nOn his security clearance application (e-QIP), Applicant disclosed that he used \nmarijuana about 25 times between September 1998 and May 2002. He also disclosed \nthat he used cocaine about 63 times between September 1998 and the \u201cpresent\u201d (GX 1 \nat 33). He signed his application on November 6, 2007 (GX 1 at 36 and 37).  \n \n \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories on March 25, 2008, Applicant again \ndisclosed his uses of marijuana and cocaine, and he also disclosed had used ecstasy \nabout four times a year until December 2005, used methamphetamine twice, and taken \npain killers about ten times a year until 2004. He stated he would not use illegal drugs or \nuse prescription drugs unlawfully in the future (GX 2 at 3). \n \n \nIn his response to additional DOHA interrogatories on April 15, 2008, Applicant \ndisclosed using marijuana about 25 times ending in May 2002, using cocaine about 60 \ntimes ending in November 2007, and using ecstasy about 20 times ending in 2006. He \nstated his drug use had been declining over the past three years and it was easy for him \nto stop when he was offered his current job (GX 3 at 3). \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in January 2008, Applicant \nadmitted using marijuana about 25 times while an undergraduate in college. He \nremembered purchasing marijuana twice. On all other occasions, someone gave him \nthe marijuana (GX 4 at 1). He also admitted his cocaine use and admitted purchasing \ncocaine twice while in graduate school and once after he graduated (GX 4 at 2). He \nadmitted using methamphetamine once and ecstasy about 10 times while in college and \n10 more times after graduation, usually paying $20 for one pill (GX 4 at 4). Finally, he \n\n \n3 \n \n \nadmitted traveling to Canada and purchasing 100 or 200 painkiller pills containing \ncodeine without a prescription. The purchase was lawful in Canada, but a prescription \nwas required in the U.S. Sometimes he used the pills for pain relief and sometimes to \nbecome intoxicated. He shared the pills with his friends until they were all consumed \n(GX 4 at 5). \n \n \nAccording to the security investigator\u2019s summary of the interview, Applicant told \nthe security investigator he did not disclose his methamphetamine use on his e-QIP \nbecause methamphetamine is similar to cocaine and he believed his methamphetamine \nuse was covered in his use of cocaine. It also states Applicant told the investigator he \ndid not disclose his use of ecstasy because he did not think the question about illegal \ndrug use covered ecstasy (GX 4 at 4-5), and he told the investigator he did not disclose \nhis illegal use of prescription pain killers because it was an oversight (GX 4 at 5). \n \n \nApplicant testified he did not disclose his methamphetamine use on his e-QIP \nbecause he did not remember it, until his memory was triggered by the interview (Tr. \n46). He said the security investigator\u2019s report of his interview was inaccurate, because \nthe investigator suggested he might have thought that methamphetamine use was \nincluded in cocaine use, and he agreed, even though it was not really what he was \nthinking (Tr. 47). He admitted he did not tell the investigator he had forgotten about his \nmethamphetamine use (Tr. 48).  \n \n \nApplicant testified he did not disclose his ecstasy use on his e-QIP because he \ndid not think of it, and nothing jogged his memory (Tr. 53). He denied telling the security \ninvestigator he did not think the question about drug use covered ecstasy. He testified \nhe told the investigator there was nothing in the application that triggered his memory of \nhis ecstasy use (Tr. 55-56). \n \n \nApplicant testified he last used marijuana in 2005, but his memory was \u201ca little \nfuzzier\u201d because his marijuana use declined gradually (Tr. 40). He also testified he did \nnot disclose any marijuana use after 2002 on his e-QIP because he did not remember \nthe isolated incidents of use after his graduation (Tr. 41-42). \n \n \nApplicant testified he did not disclose his illegal use of prescription pain killers on \nhis e-QIP because he did not remember it. He characterized it as an isolated incident, \nwhich he did not remember until the security investigator started asking him about travel \noutside the country (Tr. 58-59). \n \n \nApplicant testified he completed his e-QIP on line at home. He completed it twice \nbecause the first attempt \u201cgot snagged somewhere\u201d and was not received. It took \nseveral days to complete it (Tr. 38-40). He did not seek help from his security officer or \nanyone else to interpret the questions (Tr. 40). \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant used a line graph (AX A) to depict his cocaine use. \nReferring to the graph, he testified that 80 to 90 percent of his cocaine use occurred \nbetween 2000 and 2004, while he was in college. After graduation, his cocaine use \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndeclined to once or twice a year and then stopped entirely (Tr. 34-35). He presented his \ntranscripts (AX B and C) to demonstrate that his cocaine use did not affect his academic \nperformance, even though he was also working full-time while in his M.B.A. program \n(Tr. 35-36). He testified he last used any illegal drugs was in September 2007, and the \nentry on his e-QIP was reflecting last drug use in November 2007 was incorrect (Tr. 36). \n \n \nAn active duty captain in the U.S. Marine Corps testified for Applicant (Tr. 64-68). \nThe witness and Applicant went to high school and college together and were members \nof the same fraternity. The witness was aware of Applicant\u2019s drug use in college, \nbecause it was common knowledge among their circle of friends. In 1999, when they \nwere sophomores, he voted for Applicant to be the fraternity vice-president of finance. \nApplicant was responsible for fraternity funds of about $170,000. The following year, he \nvoted for Applicant to be president of the fraternity, because of his good performance as \nvice-president of finance and because of his good relations with the alumni and \nuniversity officials.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, who also attended the same college as Applicant and was \na member of the same fraternity, testified for Applicant (Tr. 73-79). He was aware of \nApplicant\u2019s drug use in college, but he voted for Applicant to be the vice-president for \nfinance because he was reliable. He voted for Applicant to be president of the fraternity \nbecause he was respected in the college community and the fraternity. He recruited \nApplicant to come to work for his current employer, knowing that he would need a \nsecurity clearance. \n \n \nAnother of Applicant\u2019s supervisors, who also is the facility security officer, \ntestified they recruited and selected Applicant because of his strong referrals and \nprofessional experience. He was aware of Applicant\u2019s prior drug use, but regarded it as \n\u201cbad choices in the past\u201d and not indicative of his current or future performance (Tr. 81-\n82). When Applicant started filling out his e-QIP, the witness advised him to not \nembellish but to not cover up anything (Tr. 85). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n\n \n5 \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe SOR alleges multiple instances of illegal drug use between September 1998 \nand November 2007, as well as purchases of cocaine, marijuana, and ecstasy. The \nconcern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a \nprescription \ndrug \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability \nand \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \n\n \n6 \n \n \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24. This guideline encompasses use or misuse of Adrugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens). AG \n\u00b6 24(a)(1). Drug abuse is Athe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.@ AG \u00b6 24(b). \n \nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include Aany drug abuse,@ and \nAillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, \nor distribution\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c). The evidence raises these two disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of \u00b6 \n26(a) (Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on the recentness of drug involvement. There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. ISCR Case No. \n02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP indicates he was still using cocaine when he signed it. At the \nhearing, he testified the e-QIP was incorrect and that he stopped using illegal drugs in \nSeptember 2007, about 11 months before the hearing. I conclude his drug use was \nrecent. The 11-month period followed ten years of regular and sometimes frequent drug \nuse. During all of those 11 months of abstinence, Applicant has been undergoing \nscrutiny, including an interview by a security investigator in January 2008, and DOHA \ninterrogatories in March and April 2008. He has not carried his burden of persuading me \nthat he will not resume his drug use once he is relieved of pressure of obtaining a \nclearance. Thus, I conclude the first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. The \nremaining prongs of AG \u00b6 26(a) are likewise not established. His drug use was frequent, \ndid not occur under unusual circumstances, and casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by \nevidence of Aa demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.@ AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(1)-(4).  \n \n \nApplicant admitted at the hearing he still associates with some of his drug-using \nfriends and a friend offered him cocaine in March 2008. For the reasons noted above, \nhe has not had \u201can appropriate period of abstinence.\u201d I conclude AG \u00b6 26(b) is not \nestablished.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished because Applicant has not received any drug treatment.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified his e-QIP by disclosing his marijuana and \ncocaine use but not disclosing his use of methamphetamine, ecstasy, and prescription \ndrugs. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). When a \nfalsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind \nwhen the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case \nNo. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug use covered ten years, and it is understandable that he might \nnot accurately recall the specific dates, frequency, and quantities of the drugs he \npurchased and used. It is somewhat plausible that he might even have forgotten \nisolated incidents, such as his one-time purchase of pain killers in Canada or one-time \nexperimentation with methamphetamine. It is less plausible that he would forget his use \nof ecstasy ten times while in college and ten more times after graduation. It also is less \n\n \n8 \n \n \nplausible that he would not remember his continued use of marijuana after graduation. \nAfter considering all the evidence of record, I am satisfied Applicant knew his drug use \nwas an issue, knew his employers were aware of his drug use in college, knew that \nthere was no evidence of his drug use other than his own admissions, and decided to \nunderstate his drug use on his e-QIP. Based on the above considerations, I conclude \nthe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting the burden to Applicant to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant made no effort to correct his omissions until he was \ninterviewed by a security investigator in January 2008. I conclude this mitigating \ncondition is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct also may be mitigated by showing \n\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nFalsification of an e-QIP is a felony, not a minor offense. The falsification was recent \nand did not occur under unique circumstances. Applicant\u2019s lack of candor casts doubt \non his reliability and trustworthiness. I conclude this mitigating condition is not \nestablished. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. My comments \nabove concerning Guidelines H and E are incorporated in my whole person analysis. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant is well-educated, intelligent, and a natural leader, as evidenced by the \ntestimony of his college classmates and fraternity brothers. He decision to stop his drug \nuse was motivated by an opportunity for employment and the need for a clearance. His \ncurrent employment may well be a turning point in his life, but he needs more time to \ndemonstrate his desire to be drug free.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nSeptember 15, 2011\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn February 28, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn April 21, 2011, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nMay 18, 2011. DOHA issued notices of hearing on June 20, 2011, and June 22, 2011,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 13, 2011. The Government offered\nExhibits 1 through 10, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf and submitted Exhibits A through H, at the time of hearing, which were also\nadmitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s wife also testified on his behalf. DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr) on July 26, 2011. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep\n\n2\nthe record open until July 27, 2011, to submit additional documents, and additional\ndocuments that were received have been identified and entered into evidence without\nobjection as Exhibit I. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and the testimony\nof Applicant and the additional witnesses, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and his wife,\nand upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 39 years old. He is married, and he and his wife have three children.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance\nin connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR lists eight allegations (1.a., 1.c. through 1.i.) regarding overdue debts\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F. No allegation of overdue debt was cited for 1.b. in the\nSOR in my file or that of the Department Counsel. The allegations will be discussed\nbelow in the same order as they were listed on the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a judgement in the amount of\n$1,660. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he had paid this debt on December 7,\n2009. (Tr at 33-34.)  Exhibit D included an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Full\nJudgement showing that this judgement has been satisfied. I find that this debt has\nbeen resolved.     \n1.b. There is no allegation 1.b.\n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a judgement in the amount of\n$2,013.  Applicant testified that he had paid this debt on July 9, 2008. (Tr at 40-41.)\nExhibit D included an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Full Judgement showing that\nthis judgement has been satisfied. I find that this debt has been resolved.     \n     \n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $74. Applicant\ntestified that he had paid this debt on October 4, 2010. (Tr at 40-41.) Applicant\nsubmitted a letter from this creditor showing that this debt was paid in full. (Exhibit D.)  I\nfind that this debt has been resolved.          \n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $11,787.  Applicant\ntestified that he settled this debt on March 31, 2011, by paying $6,000. He withdrew\n$8,500 from his Thrifts Savings Plan (TSP) to pay this debt. (Tr at 42-43.) Applicant\nsubmitted a letter from this creditor showing that this debt was paid in full. (Exhibit D.)  I\nfind that this debt has been resolved.          \n   \n\n3\n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,649.  Applicant\ntestified that he settled this debt on March 31, 2011, by paying $1,000. (Tr at 43-44.) \nApplicant submitted a letter from this creditor showing that this debt was satisfied.\n(Exhibit D.)  I find that this debt has been resolved.          \n    \n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $175.  Applicant\ntestified that he settled this debt on March 18, 2011, by paying $100. (Tr at 44-45.)\nApplicant submitted a letter from this creditor showing that this debt was settled in full.\n(Exhibit D.)  I find that this debt has been resolved.          \n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $14,540. Applicant\ntestified that this debt is the same as that listed as 1.e., above, and he settled it for\n$6,000.  (Tr at 43, 45-46.) Applicant submitted a letter from this creditor showing that\nthis debt is the same as 1.e.,and it was settled in full. (Exhibit D.) I find that this debt has\nbeen resolved. \n1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $120. Applicant\ntestified that he settled this debt on October 20, 2009. (Tr at 46.)  Applicant submitted a\nletter from this creditor showing that this debt was paid in full. (Exhibit D.)  I find that this\ndebt has been resolved.          \nApplicant testified that the majority of his financial problems occurred because\nhis wife had an alcohol problem, and since she was \u201ctaking care of the finances,\u201d he\nwas unaware of the credit card debt that she was incurring until it had mushroomed into\na significant amount of overdue debt. Applicant engaged the services of a debt\nconsolidation company, paid them $1,500 in total, and instructed them to contact his\ncreditors to attempt to resolve his debts. However, unbeknownst to him, they did not\ncontact the creditors and several of the debts went to judgment. Ultimately, he resolved\nthe overdue debts himself.  (Tr at 46-50.)\nApplicant testified that his current financial situation is up to date with no overdue\ndebts. He subscribes to a credit reporting agency, which gives him access to his credit\nreports on a daily basis. He reviews his reports every other day, and his credit score\nhas gone from 492 to 635, a significant increase. He\u2019s lived with his family in his current\nhome for approximately one year, and he has never been late with his monthly rental\npayment. (Tr at 55-68.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has engaged in criminal acts.\n2.a.  The SOR alleges that in August 2008 Applicant was arrested and charged\nwith two counts of Inflicting Corporal Injury on a Spouse/Cohabitant- a felony. Applicant\npled guilty to the lesser charge of False Imprisonment. As a result, he was placed on\nthree years probation, which was due to expire on April 8, 2012, and to pay a fine. \n\n4\nApplicant testified that his wife developed a problem with alcohol. One day she\ncame home with a cut on her face from what he believed to be her climbing among the\ntrees, which she had done previously when she was intoxicated. Several days later he\nwas concerned about her safety because of her erratic behavior, and he phoned the\npolice. Ultimately, the police charged Applicant with battery on his wife, based on what\nshe told them.\n \nApplicant averred that he had not struck his wife, and she recanted her story,\ntelling the police he had not struck her. However, the charges were not dropped, and\nsince he was informed it was going to cost him $15,000 to continue with the case in\ncourt, and his wife was developing hives because of the stress, he chose to plead the\ncase down to the charge of False Imprisonment, pay a $150 fine, attend a class, and he\nwas placed on three years probation. Applicant testified that his wife no longer\nconsumes alcohol, they have gone to family counseling, and their relationship has\nsignificantly improved. (70-80.)\nExhibit F includes the court documents regarding allegation 2.b. The last\ndocument is a minute order stating that on April 19, 2011, Applicant\u2019s conviction was set\naside and a plea of Not Guilty was ordered and the case was dismissed. Itt also stated\nthat Applicant\u2019s wife was present and agreed with the dismissal. \nMitigation\nAs stated above, Applicant\u2019s wife testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. She confirmed\nthat she took out a number of credit cards in Applicant\u2019s name and purchased items, all\nwithout Applicant\u2019s knowledge. By the time he became aware of the situation , their bills\nwere severely overdue. She has now been sober for three years, but her alcoholism\ncontributed to the financial difficulties, and also to their marital problems. She now\nattends counseling sessions every other week, and she attends Alcoholics Anonymous\non a regular basis. \nMost significantly, she confirmed that her husband had never stuck her, but she\nreceived the cut that was the subject of the arrest from falling in the bushes when she\nwas intoxicated. She also confirmed she no longer consumes alcohol, and their\nrelationship has greatly improved. (Tr at 87-94.)  \nApplicant submitted 16 extremely positive character letters from family, friends\nand those who know Applicant in the work environment. One co-worker described his\n\u201csignificant integrity and ethical behavior\u201d in his actions and his words. He was also\ndescribed as someone having \u201ca high degree of integrity, responsibility and ambition.\u201d\n(Exhibit B.) He also submitted a packet of awards received by his family and other\ninformation about his family. (Exhibit C.)   \nExhibit H is Applicant\u2019s current credit report establishing that his current credit\nscore is 635 for Experian, 635 for Equifax and 645 for TransUnion. Finally, Applicant\nalso forwarded his Performance Plan and Review from his employer on January 19,\n2011. (Exhibit I.) His overall performance was rated \u201cFully Effective.\u201d  \n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns and\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19 (c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. I find that both of these\ndisqualifying conditions apply to Applicant in this case. The evidence has established\nthat Applicant has accumulated significant delinquent debt. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties: Under AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted\nabove, Applicant testified that his financial problems resulted from his wife obtaining\ncredit cards and not paying the bills on the items that she purchased, all without\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge.  I find that he acted responsibly, once he became aware of the\noverdue debts. Applicant first engaged the services of a debt consolidation company,\npaying them $1,500, and then when they did not fulfill their contract, he paid off his\ndebts himself.  He has now resolved all of his overdue debts. Therefore, I find that this\nmitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nFinally, AG \u00b6  20(d) is applicable since Applicant has \u201cinitiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d I find that this mitigating\ncondition is also a factor for consideration in this case.\nI conclude that Applicant has resolved all of his overdue debt, and he has shown\nthat he and his wife can maintain more financial stability. Therefore, he has mitigated\nthe financial concerns of the Government.\n\n7\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe Government established that Applicant was arrested, charged, and\npled guilty to criminal conduct, as alleged in subparagraph 2.a. However, based on the\nvery credible testimony of Applicant and his wife, I am convinced that the underlying\nconduct that is the basis for the criminal charges, namely Applicant striking his wife, did\nnot occur.  \nI find that no Disqualifying Condition under \u00b6 31 is applicable to this case.\nParagraph 2, Guideline J is found for Applicant\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n  \nI considered the potentially Disqualifying and Mitigating conditions in light\nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons\ncited above as to why the Mitigating Conditions apply under Guideline F, and the reason\nthat no Disqualifying Conditions are present under Guideline J, considered together with\nthe positive character letters on behalf of Applicant, I find that the record evidence\nleaves me with no significant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance under the whole-person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nFebruary 26, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 12, 2008, and waived his \nright to a hearing before an administrative judge. On October 17, 2008, the Government \nfiled a request for hearing pursuant Paragraph E3.1.7 of the Additional Procedural \nGuidance at Enclosure 3 of DoD Directive 5220.6. On December 8, 2008, DOHA \nassigned the case to me and issued a Notice of Hearing on January 7, 2009. The case \nwas heard on January 29, 2009, as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. \nThe record remained open until February 13, 2009, in order to give Applicant an \nopportunity to submit pertinent information. On February 11, 2009, he submitted exhibits \n(AE) A through I that were admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on February 9, 2009.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c of the SOR, and denied the allegation contained in \u00b6 2.a. Those \nadmissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old and twice married. He married his first wife in 1987 and \nhad two children with her, ages 18 and 20. One of these children is in college and the \nother lives with Applicant\u2019s former wife. Applicant married his current wife in 1998 with \nwhom he has two children. His wife has a child by a former marriage. The three \nchildren, ages 7, 10 and 13, all reside with them. His wife is a licensed professional \ncounselor.  \n \n  \nApplicant enlisted in the Air Force in 1986 and retired with an honorable \ndischarge in September 2006 as a Technical Sergeant (E-6). While in the Air Force, he \nhad a Top Secret clearance. He worked in the Command Control Division and had \naccess to classified information. He was assigned to Special Operations for two years, \nduring which he was deployed overseas most of the time. He comes from a family with \na history of military service. Both of his grandfathers served in the Army. His father was \nin the U.S. Marines and Army, and his brother is a Technical Sergeant in the Air Force. \nHe has held a security clearance since 1986 with no discrepancies in security policies. \nHe earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science while in the service. \n \n \nApplicant earned several awards and decorations during his military career, \nincluding four achievement medals, and a Joint Service Achievement Medal. (AE I)  His \nformer commander, a Senior Master Sergeant, submitted a character letter. He found \nApplicant to be very reliable, competent, dependable and hardworking. (AE H)                                      \n \n \nAfter being discharged from the Air Force in 2006, Applicant worked for two \ndefense contractors until April 2008, when he obtained his current position with another \nfederal contractor as an information systems security analyst. He has had access to \nclassified information while working for these contractors.   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nIn September 2003, Applicant was arrested for Child Neglect by the military \npolice on the base where he lived. Immediately prior to the arrest, he had returned \nhome from work in the morning and was responsible for the care of his two children, \nages 2 and 5, as his wife had left for work. He was tired that morning, having worked \nthe night shift. He admitted that he mistakenly fell asleep and his children left the house, \nand went to the park behind their house unsupervised. His neighbor called the police, \nwho then came to his house and woke him up. His wife came home and his supervisor \ncame over. He was handcuffed and taken to the station where he wrote a statement \nand was then released. He subsequently received a Letter of Reprimand. He did not \nreceive any other disciplinary action. (Tr. 28) \n \n \nIn March 2006, Applicant was arrested for shoplifting a computer disk from the \nbase store. He had paid for other items before leaving the store. On April 1, 2006, at a \nhearing conducted under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice, he admitted the \nshoplifting charge and received a reduction in pay grade (suspended) and forfeited \n$438. After being disciplined, he voluntarily decided to seek professional help because \nof the shame he felt. (Tr. 31-32) He attended weekly counseling for about six months. \nAlthough he does not have a clear explanation for the impulsive act, he learned a great \ndeal about himself through the counseling sessions. He is a better husband and father, \nhaving participated in it. (Tr. 34) He remains very embarrassed by the incident, which \nwas out of character for him. He repaid the base store $200 two weeks after the arrest. \n(GE 2)  \n \n \nIn July 2005, Applicant completed his SF 86. Section 26 on the SF 86 inquired \nabout his Police Record \u2013 Other Offenses: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you ever been \ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25?\u201d  \nIn response to that question, he answered \u201cNo\u201d and did not disclose the September \n2003 child neglect arrest at the base. However, he did disclose that he had consulted a \nmental health professional in the past.1 \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose the 2003 charge because he did not understand that \nhe was arrested on that date.2 (Tr. 22) He was taken to the police station after the police \narrived at his home, but he never went to court or received notice of anything about it \nother than a letter of reprimand. He did, however, mention the incident to a government \ninvestigator when he was discussing more fully his answers on his SF-86. (Tr. 30) He \nwas then told he should have disclosed it. He did not deliberately fail to disclose it and \nhad no intention to defraud or withhold information from the Government. (Tr. 23; 33) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor requested a salary increase for him as a result \nof his outstanding work during his first year with his present employer. In the first annual \nperformance evaluation, the supervisor referred to Applicant as \u201ca model employee.\u201d \n(AE E) In a character letter, the supervisor noted that he is aware of Applicant\u2019s security \n                                            \n1Applicant sought mental health services in June 2001 for counseling about his children from his \nfirst marriage. (GE 2) \n2 Applicant completed his SF 86 in July 2005, which was before the March 2006 arrest. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nclearance issues, as Applicant\u2019s has been very \u201cforthcoming and open about the \ncircumstances surround this issue and quick to answer questions and provide details \nwhen asked.\u201d (AE F) He has no reservations about recommending him for a clearance. \n(Id.)  \n \n \nWhile testifying, Applicant expressed remorse over both incidents and indicated \nthat he has not been arrested or charged with any other incident since the March 2006 \ncharge. (Tr. 33) Applicant\u2019s wife, supervisor and co-workers were aware of incidents \nand his counseling at the time they occurred. (GE 2).   \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe Government\u2019s concerns regarding criminal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 30:  \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes six conditions that could raise a security concern, two of which \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nApplicant admitted the two criminal arrests for minor offenses and that he went to \nan Article 15 UCMJ hearing for theft. The Government established both \ndisqualifications.  \n \nAfter the Government raised a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to \nprovide evidence to rebut or to prove mitigation. AG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nThe record evidence supports the application of AG \u00b6 32(d). The last criminal \noffense occurred two years ago and there is no evidence of the recurrence of similar \nmisconduct. Applicant is very remorseful and made restitution on the theft charge two \nweeks after his arrest. He voluntarily entered counseling and completed it after six \nmonths. He had a good work record while in the Air Force and during his first year with \na defense contractor. He spoke candidly of his misconduct and dedication to his current \nemployer.  \n \n \nThe record does not support the application of the other three mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 32. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the Government\u2019s security concern pertaining to personal \nconduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant falsified his answer to \nSection 26. Your Police Record \u2013 Other Offenses, in that he failed to disclose the \nSeptember 2003 Child Neglect arrest. The Government contended that the omission \nmay raise a security concern and be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that he deliberately omitted information about the 2003 incident.  \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the \nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining \nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nApplicant did not realize that the previous 2003 incident was a charge or arrest \nthat he needed to disclose when he completed his SF 86 because he never went to \ncourt or received any type of punishment for the incident, other than a letter of \nreprimand. He subsequently disclosed it during an interview with a government \ninvestigator while discussing more fully his answers to the SF 86. At that time, he \nlearned it should have been disclosed. Given his truthful disclosure of his 2001 \ncounseling for issues related to one of his children and his candid testimony during this \nhearing, I find his explanation plausible and credible. The omission of the information \nwas not intentional; hence, the evidence does not establish deliberate falsification or a \nviolation of federal law. This Guideline is found in his favor. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the many positive aspects in \nApplicant\u2019s life. He is a 41-year-old man, who honorably served his country for twenty \nyears in the U.S. Air Force, during which time he held a Top-Secret clearance. After \nleaving military service, he began employment with a defense contractor and continues \nto successfully support the Government in his new position, while maintaining a Top \nSecret security clearance.  He is intelligent, honest and hardworking. His background \ncontains two minor negative incidents, for which Applicant feels great embarrassment \nand remorse. After the 2006 shoplifting arrest, he voluntarily sought counseling and \ncontinued it for several months. As a result, he learned a great deal about himself and \nimproved his relationship with his family. His previous and current supervisors, as well \nas his family, are aware of his background, decreasing the potential for coercion or \nexploitation over the incidents. He recognizes his mistakes and has taken steps to \naddress them.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Criminal Conduct and Personal \nConduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n   Subparagraphs 1.a -1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On May 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him (GE 14), pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security \n \n1On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \nSeptember 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nconcerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal Conduct). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn May 28, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (GE 15). Department \nCounsel exercised his right to a hearing. On August 6, 2008, Department Counsel \nstated he was ready to proceed and on August 8, 2008, the case was assigned to me. \nOn August 8, 2008, notice was issued for the hearing, which was held on August 26, \n2008 (GE 13). Department Counsel offered twelve exhibits into evidence (Tr. 21-22). \nApplicant did not object to my consideration of these documents and I admitted them \ninto evidence (Tr. 22-23; GE 1-12). On September 4, 2008, Applicant provided \nadditional documentation (AE F). Department Counsel did not object to my \nconsideration of AE F, and I admitted AE F into evidence. I held the record open until \nSeptember 7, 2008, to permit Applicant to provide additional documentation (Tr. 36, 64-\n65). I received the transcript (Tr.) on September 8, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations with explanations (GE 15). His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 24 years old (Tr. 5).2 He was born in September 1983. He married in \n2003 and divorced in 2006. He does not have any children. He graduated from high \nschool in 2001, and attended college from August 2006 to May 2007 (Tr. 6). His college \neducation focused on information technology (Tr. 6). He served on active duty in the \nU.S. Marines from January 2002 until January 2006. His DD Form 214 (AE A) listed the \nfollowing awards: Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, Navy \nand Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Global \nWar on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon and National \nDefense Service Medal. His military specialty was as a Data Network Systems \nTechnician (AE A). He does not currently hold a security clearance (Tr. 6). He had an \ninterim clearance when he was on active duty (Tr. 7). \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nIn June 2001, Applicant was charged in Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court \nwith two counts of Arson (Burn Building), a felony offense (GE 15). He pleaded nolo \n \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n2GE 3 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ncontendere to an amended charge of Destruction of Private Property (GE 15). On or \nabout September 30, 2002, the court ordered Applicant to pay $1,000 restitution (GE \n15). On November 18, 2003, the court agreed Applicant completed the court ordered \nrequirement and the matter was \u201cclosed\u201d (GE 11). \n \n \nOn April 29, 2002, the police arrested Applicant, and officials charged him with \n\u201cEmbezzlement and Grand Larceny,\u201d both felonies (GE 15). A court document \ndescribes the criminal complaint for the embezzlement [GE 5 at 2] as follows: \n \nOn 1-1-02 [Applicant], while on duty as an employee of [a store], removed \nfrom the stock of that business a . . . wardrobe valued at $999.00, a \nMetropolitan leather chair valued at $1,229.00, and a Manhattan sofa \nvalued at $2,499.00. He took those items to the rear loading dock of the \nstore. . . . He called [B], who came to the loading dock in a truck and took \npossession of the items and took them to [B\u2019s] residence. [B] maintained \npossession of the items and took them to his own residence until [the \npolice] seized them on 1-29-02 and returned them to the business. . . \nApplicant admitted to [the police] that he stole from the [store].      \n \nThe criminal complaint for the grand larceny indicated on October 31, 2001, Applicant \nand B entered a truck and took three laptop computers valued at $8,754.00 (GE 6 at 1, \n3). It also indicates \u201cboth subjects were adults on the date of this larceny . . . [Applicant] \nand [B] have admitted at least three other incidents of larcenies from vehicles under \nsimilar circumstances. These cases will be held for direct indictment at a later time\u201d (GE \n6 at 3). Applicant had turned 18 one month before the break-in and theft of the \ncomputers.  \n \nOn October 1, 2004, Applicant pleaded nolo contendere to the charges in Circuit \nCourt, and the court ordered him to pay $9,504 in restitution, court costs of $706, and \ntwo years of unsupervised probation (GE 8, 10, 15). His pretrial agreement stipulated to \ndeferred adjudication of the findings (GE 8 at 2). Applicant complied with the terms of \nthe agreement, and on December 6, 2004, the charges were dismissed (GE 11).     \n \n \nApplicant explained that when he committed the offenses he was 17 years old \n(Tr. 26). He was charged with the second felony after he turned 18 years of age (Tr. \n27). He thought his criminal record was expunged (Tr. 27-29). He did not have any \nexpungement orders (Tr. 28). He thought his lawyer said after he served three years \u201cit \ngoes away\u201d (Tr. 29). He believes when the charge is dismissed it meant expunged (Tr. \n29).   \n \nFalsification of Security Clearance Applications \n \nApplicant signed SF 86s on July 9, 2002 (GE 1), and June 20, 2007 (GE 3), and \nincorrectly responded, \u201cNo\u201d to questions pertaining to previous criminal offenses. \nQuestions 21, 23 and 26 of his SF 86, dated July 9, 2002, (GE 1) asked: \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n21. Your Police Record \u2013 Felony Offenses For this item, report \ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \n\u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the court record. The single exception \nto this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under \nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. Have you ever been \ncharged with or convicted of any felony offense?  \n \n23. Your Police Record \u2013 Pending Charges Are there currently any \ncharges pending against you for any criminal offense? \n \n26. Your Police Record \u2013 Other Offenses For this item, report \ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \n\u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the court record. The single exception \nto this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under \nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. In the last 7 years, have \nyou been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not \nlisted in modules 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25? (Leave out traffic offenses of less \nthan $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)   \n \nSection 23 of his SF 86, dated June 20, 2007, (GE 3) asked: \n \nSection 23: Your Police Record \u2013 Felony Offenses for this item, report \ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \n\u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the court record. The single exception \nto this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under \nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. a. Have you ever been \ncharged with or convicted of any felony offense? (Include those under the \nUniform Code of Military Justice.); and Section 23: Your Police Record \nIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted \nof any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave \nout traffic offenses of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or \ndrug related.)    \n \nDuring a July 31, 2007, interview with an investigator for the Department of \nDefense (DoD), Applicant said he had never been arrested for, charged with, or \nconvicted of any offense within the last seven years (GE 11). At his hearing, he \nconfirmed that he provided false information about not being charged to the investigator \n(Tr. 32).  \n \nOn April 2, 2008, Applicant explained why he answered, \u201cNo\u201d to these questions. \nFirst, he was never \u201carrested\u201d because he went to the police station without being taken \ninto custody (GE 11). He explained, \u201cI was never arrested, nor convicted for these \nincidents. I was however charged with these Felonies but failed to mention them due to \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nmisunderstanding. These charges were juvenile and I was under the impression that \nthey all went away after the d[e]ferred finding case and dismissal of all charges.\u201d And \nlater he said, \u201cI was under the impression, after being told by my attorney, that they all \nwent away after the d[e]ferred finding case and dismissal of all charges.\u201d  He concluded \nhis statement (GE 11): \n \nSince these charges, I have served my country in the United States \nMarine Corps for 6 years, have been decorated for two overseas combat \ntours, have received three Navy and Marine Corps Achievement medals, \nreceived a good conduct medal, and have been consistent with exemplary \nbehavior and stature far beyond an immature teen could ever imagine. I \nhave dealt with Secret and at times TS sensitive data and documents that \nhave saved peoples lives in war.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement at his hearing was consistent with his April 2, 2008, \nstatement (Tr. 29). He believed he disclosed the criminal offenses to his recruiter, but \nwas not sure whether he placed that information on his enlistment documents (Tr. 46-\n48). He did not have copies of his enlistment documents (Tr. 46). He was charged with \nthe second felony after boot camp, and did not believe he was charged with the second \nfelony at the time he completed his 2002 security clearance application (Tr. 30).3 He \nwas never charged with fraudulent enlistment in the Marines (Tr. 31). He did not receive \nany letters of reprimand or nonjudicial punishment (Tr. 31). He did not provide \ninformation on his security clearance applications and to the DoD investigator because \nhe thought he had an expungement order (Tr. 33). He thought \u201cexpunge\u201d meant the \ncharges did not exist (Tr. 42). He described the failure to disclose the criminal \ninformation as a problem with being uneducated and confused (Tr. 41, 42). He \ncontended his lawyer who handled the criminal cases was not clear about the meaning \nof expungement (Tr. 42). Back in 2001 or 2002 he was told the charges \u201cwent away\u201d \nand he did not have to put them on employment records (Tr. 43-44). He was not sure he \nwas actually told not to put the information on employment documents (Tr. 50). He was \nsure he was told after successful probation the charges would be \u201call gone. It\u2019s - - killed. \nYou\u2019re free and clear, no charges.\u201d (Tr. 50). His assumptions about the charges led to \nuneducated answers (Tr. 51). Applicant said once he became aware that the \nconvictions had to be disclosed, he disclosed them (Tr. 33). After he received DOHA\u2019s \ninterrogatories, he went back to the attorney who handled the criminal litigation, and \nconfronted his attorney about the expungement issue (Tr. 49). His attorney told \nApplicant he should have put the offenses on his security clearance documents, and \nshould never put false information on such a form (Tr. 44, 49).    \n \n \n3Applicant\u2019s indictments for embezzlement and theft of the laptop computers were filed on April \n24, 2002 (GE 5 at 1, GE 6 at 1), which was before Applicant executed his 2002 security clearance \napplication on July 11, 2002. The date of service of the embezzlement indictment is not indicated on the \nindictment (GE 5). The indictment for theft of the laptop computers was served on Applicant\u2019s attorney on \nApril 29, 2002 (GE 6 at 1). There is no evidence that Applicant was aware of these two indictments before \nhe executed his 2002 security clearance application.   \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant said when he was in high school he lacked direction (Tr. 33). He made \nvery poor decisions when he was 17 (Tr. 37). He said, \u201cI was just pretty much on a \ndeteriorated path\u201d (Tr. 33). He joined the Marines to straighten out his life (Tr. 34). His \nlife is now going a completely different direction (Tr. 37). He wanted to be part of an elite \nforce (Tr. 34). He finished first in his class of 320 Marines and was designated \nCompany Honor Graduate (Tr. 34; AE F at 9-10). He was promoted within two months \n(Tr. 34). He completed two combat tours in Fallujah, Iraq (Tr. 34). His Marine Corps \nduties were as a Data Network Systems Technician (Tr. 38). He was very conscientious \nabout the information in his care (Tr. 38). He was entrusted with highly classified \ninformation in Iraq that was used to save lives in the war (Tr. 37). He provided \ndocumentation describing his duties in combat (AE F at 5, 6, 7, 13). After leaving active \nduty in 2006, he worked with information technology and computer networks, and his \nresponsibilities included safeguarding sensitive information (Tr. 38-40). He emphasized \nhis hard work and dedication to his duties as well as his regret and remorse about his \nmisconduct before he joined the Marines (Tr. 40). \n \nRecommendations \n \n \n \nApplicant provided letters of support from a major (AE F at 5), a master gunnery \nsergeant (AE F at 6), and a gunnery sergeant (AE F at 7), describing his duty \nperformance in the Marines in garrison and in Iraq. He also provided a fitness report \n(AE F at 8), and two certificates for the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (AE \nF at 12, 13). Applicant \u201cexemplified a combat leader.\u201d He participated in \u201ccountless \ncombat convoys\u201d (AE F at 13). The documentation emphasized his expertise, superb \nprofessionalism, total dedication, conscientious attention to his duties, initiative, \nperseverance and sterling character.     \n \nApplicant\u2019s co-worker at the government contractor for 18 months, and his \nsupervisor the last six months (Tr. 57; AE B) lauded Applicant\u2019s professionalism, \ntrustworthiness, solid character and technical expertise.4 Applicant told him the offenses \nwere the product of his youth and stupidity, and now he is mature and responsible (Tr. \n54-57). He has made positive changes in his character (Tr. 57). Applicant\u2019s \nperformance is outstanding. He recommended Applicant receive \u201ca position of National \nSecurity.\u201d \n \n \nAnother co-worker with Applicant for six months in 2006 averred Applicant has a \npositive attitude, and produced quality work quickly. Applicant is proactive, innovative, \ncreative, and efficient. Applicant is helpful to others and shows leadership. He \nrecommends Applicant receive a secret clearance. \n \n \nA manager, who has worked with Applicant since June 2007, described Applicant \nas a \u201ckey part of our technical team.\u201d Applicant is a model employee with \u201coutstanding \n \n4The sources for the facts and opinions in this paragraph and the next three paragraphs are AE \nB-E, respectively. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ntechnical and management[] skills.\u201d He shows efficiency and solid character. She \nrecommends Applicant for \u201ca position of National Security.\u201d \n \n \nA close friend and co-worker at Applicant\u2019s current employer explained that \nApplicant has grown and matured in his discipline and responsibility. He believes \nApplicant is genuine and honest. Applicant is helpful to others and takes his \nresponsibilities seriously. Applicant does not have any character flaws.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n5 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guidelines E (Personal \nConduct) and J (Criminal Conduct).  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n \n6 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose his criminal offenses in 2001 and 2002 on his 2002 \nSF 86 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), his 2007 SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and his 2007 Defense Department \ninterview (SOR \u00b6 1.c). AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG 17(b) partially applies because Applicant received inadequate legal advice \nconcerning the legal status of his dismissed offenses. His subsequent omissions and/or \nconcealment resulted from this inadequate advice. However, this mitigating condition \ndoes not fully apply because such advice was not provided \u201cspecifically concerning the \nsecurity clearance process.\u201d Upon being made aware of the requirement to provide the \ninformation about his offenses, Applicant did disclose the information sought fully and \ntruthfully. \n \nThe mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 17(f) fully applies. Although he admitted \npreparing his 2002 and 2007 SF 86, and answering incorrectly, on these clearance \ndocuments and to a DoD investigator in 2007, he did not fully understood the \nrequirement to provide the information the government sought. He was confused by the \ninstructions from his lawyer. He believed that once the charges were dismissed, they \nwere \u201cgone\u201d for reporting purposes.7 I found his statement at the hearing and in his \nSOR response to be credible. He honestly thought the charges were gone and not \nreportable. His statements show confusion about the requirement to disclose criminal \ninformation. His confrontation of his attorney shows he had a bona fide belief that his \nattorney in 2002 said the charges would be dismissed and \u201cgone\u201d provided he \nsuccessfully completed the two-year probation period. At the time he provided the false \ninformation to security officials, he thought that the answers he provided were permitted. \nHe did not intend to violate the rules, and did not have the necessary intent to establish \nthe disqualifying conduct. See Department Counsel\u2019s closing argument at Tr. 61. \nApplicant has provided sufficient information to unsubstantiate the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c.   \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \n \n7The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d The allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.b are established. Applicant \ncommitted criminal destruction of private property in 2001 as a juvenile, and felony \nembezzlement and grand larceny. He committed the grand larceny as an adult. SOR \u00b6 \n2.a alleges that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by falsifying his security clearance \napplications in 2002 and 2007, and by failing to provide information about his criminal \nrecord to the DoD investigator in 2007. Applicant provided false information under the \nmistaken belief that he did not have to report such information.   \n \nFor a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to occur, the falsification must be material. \nThe Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 \n(1995): as a statement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of \ninfluencing, the decision making body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States \nv. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004). \n \n  \nIf Applicant had provided accurate answers on his security clearance \napplications, his accurate answers are capable of influencing the government to deny \nhis security clearance. His criminal offenses are sufficiently recent and serious8 to \njeopardize approval of his security clearance in 2002, and possibly in 2007. Making a \nfalse statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the maximum \npotential sentence includes confinement for five years and a $10,000 fine). Accordingly, \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply because there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d Applicant violated \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.   \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \n8 In Applicant\u2019s case, this includes aspects such as, the seriousness of the misconduct, and the \nnumber of violations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction. \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 31(d) apply to the criminal offenses in 2001 and 2002. Applicant \ncommitted the offenses while he was 17 and 18 years old. He admitted his misconduct \nand pleaded nolo contendere. He subsequently joined the Marines in 2002 and served \nhonorably, including two tours in combat in Iraq. He completed his probation, paid \nrestitution and fines, and his charges were dismissed. He does not have any \nconvictions. He has demonstrated remorse and been reformed. He received job training \nand has a good employment record.  There is a strong evidentiary record in this case \nshowing his full rehabilitation.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 32(c) applies to the falsification allegations. Applicant denied the 2001 and \n2002 charges on his 2002 and 2007 SF 86s and to a Defense investigator in 2007. \nHowever, I am convinced that he simply misunderstood about the requirement to \nprovide this information. He is not knowledgeable about judicial or security clearance \nmatters. Taking into consideration his lack of sophistication and limited education,9 his \nmistake is reasonable. He admitted providing incorrect information, and the reason he \ndid so. For a falsification to be a criminal offense, there must be an intent to provide \nfalse information. He did not believe he was required to disclose the criminal charges \nbecause of their ultimate disposition, and the ambiguous advice of his attorney. He \nhonestly believed he did not have to provide information about his 2001 and 2002 \ncriminal record. See Department Counsel\u2019s closing argument at Tr. 60-61. The criminal \noffenses of false statements outlined in SOR \u00b6 2.a are unsubstantiated, and AG \u00b6 32(c) \nfully applies.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n \n9 Although Applicant graduated from high school, it is evident from his statement at the hearing \nthat he is not well educated. He conduct was delinquent in high school and likely he was also a below \naverage student.  \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the \nWhole Person Concept. Applicant committed offenses in 2001 and 2002, and pleaded \nnolo contendere. He believed he received deferred adjudication for all offenses. The \ncourt order indicated the 2001 offenses were \u201cclosed\u201d and the 2002 offenses were \ndismissed. He paid all restitution and fines. Most importantly after committing the \noffenses, he joined the U.S. Marines and served two combat tours in Iraq.10 After \nleaving active duty he worked for defense contractors, and aside from the SOR \nallegations no other disciplinary or security related problems surfaced. He erroneously \nmisunderstood that the offenses were not reportable because of their ultimate status. \nHe failed to disclose them on two SF 86s and to a Defense Department investigator. His \nrecord of good employment weighs in his favor. His military service especially shows \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.   \n \n  \nI do not have any questions about his current ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules and regulations. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, \nand all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he \nhas mitigated the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct and criminal \nconduct.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n10 In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) the Appeal Board explicitly limited \nthe applicability of such service to foreign influence cases, but noted: \n \nwhere the applicant has established by credible, independent evidence that his \ncompliance with security procedures and regulations occurred in the context of \ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had made a significant \ncontribution to the national security. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an applicant\u2019s \nassertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report a foreign power\u2019s \nattempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s loyal, dedicated and conscientious combat service in Iraq weighs towards approval of his \nclearance. Combat service can mature an individual. One can learn the value of freedom, living in law-\nabiding society, and the importance of national security through service in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s combat \nservice has facilitated the rehabilitation process, and makes him a much better candidate for access to \nclassified information.    \n \n11See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 14, 2008, and elected to have the case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s written case on January 13, 2009. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nMarch 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant received the FORM on January 26, 2009. He responded with a letter dated \nFebruary 23, 2009, and six attachments. Department Counsel did not object to his \nresponse. The attachments are marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) AA through FF using \nthe lettering provided by Applicant. The case was assigned to me on March 9, 2009. I \nasked Department Counsel to contact Applicant to provide him the opportunity to submit \nadditional documentation. Applicant submitted a fax cover sheet with four attached \ndocuments. The four attached documents are marked AE A through D. The fax cover \nsheet is marked AE E. AE A through E and AA through FF are admitted. Department \nCounsel\u2019s memorandum is marked File Exhibit (FE) I.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

They \njuggled payments for several months but then permitted other debts to go unpaid in an \neffort to catch up on their mortgage payments. Their finances eventually stabilized. \nApplicant borrowed $15,500 from his 401(k) in May 2008, in order to repay his \ndelinquent debts.2 Individual debts are addressed below. \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing a delinquent debt of $2,440 to a collection company \ncollecting on behalf of a bank, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He stated in his response to the \nSOR that he reached a settlement with another collection company that obtained the \ndebt, and that the debt would be reported as paid in full by July 31, 2008. Documents \nfrom the collection company showed the balance of the debt at exactly $2,440.25. \nApplicant reported in his response to the FORM that the debt was paid in full. The debt \nwas removed from his credit reports. He submitted additional documentation showing \nthat $2,440.25 was withdrawn from his checking account on July 30, 2008. Applicant \nhas submitted sufficient documentation to prove that this debt has been paid in full.3 \n \n                                                          \n1 Item 4. \n \n2 Items 3, 5; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM; AE A-E. \n \n3 Items 3, 5; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM; AE A-E, AA, BB. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a debt of $2,713 to a collection company collecting a debt on \nbehalf of a department store. The balance on the debt had risen to $3,172 as of \nFebruary 2009. Applicant settled the debt in full for $1,650 on February 10, 2009.4 \n \n \nApplicant owed $12,603 to a collection company collecting a debt on behalf of a \nfinancial institution, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He stated in his response to the FORM \nthat the debt was settled in full. The debt was removed from his credit reports but the \nresponse did not contain documentation from the creditor that the debt was paid. He \nsubmitted additional documentation showing that $7,545.15 was withdrawn from his \nchecking account on July 30, \n 2008. \nApplicant \nhas \nsubmitted \nsufficient \ndocumentation to prove that this debt has been settled in full.5 \n \n \nThe debt of $2,529 to a collection company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, is a \nduplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.6 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the $50 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, but stated \nthe debt was paid in full. The debt is not listed on the four most recent credit reports in \nevidence. I find this debt has been paid.7 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a debt of $563 to a collection company, on behalf of a \ntelephone services provider. Applicant provided a copy of a letter sent to the telephone \nservices company disputing the amount of the debt. He submitted a letter from the \ntelephone company dated February 16, 2009, adjusting the balance of his account by \n$237. The letter also noted that the company received a payment of $326 from \nApplicant on February 13, 2009, and there was a zero balance on the account.8 \n \n \nApplicant has not received formal financial counseling but he enlisted the aid of \nfamily, friends, and co-workers in working out a new method of handling family finances. \nAbout two years ago, Applicant and his wife sat down and performed a \u201cwhat went \nwrong\u201d analysis and identified the key factors that went into their situation, one being \nthe lack of communication about their finances, and the other being the lack of a \nconcrete budget. They worked out a comprehensive, flexible, long-term family budget \nand he reports that it has worked out very well for them. He has not incurred new \ndelinquent debts in several years. His financial situation is now well in order.9 \n \n \n                                                          \n4 Applicant\u2019s response to FORM; AE CC. \n \n5 Items 3, 5; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM; AE A-E, AA, BB. \n \n6 Items 3, 5-8; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM; AE AA, BB. \n \n7 Items 3, 5-8; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM; AE AA, BB. \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s response to FORM; AE EE, FF. \n \n9 Items 3, 5; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline lists several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of the \nabove potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nThree mitigating conditions under \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) through 20(e) are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has resolved all his financial issues. The debts that were his \nresponsibility have been paid or settled in full. He has not received formal financial \ncounseling but he turned to others for advice in handling his finances. He is now \nfinancially solvent. Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay his overdue \ncreditors. His financial problems have been resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nand 20(d) are applicable.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable to that part of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f that was adjusted in \nApplicant\u2019s favor by the creditor.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n     \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 32 years old. He \nmarried while he was in college and he has two children. He obtained his current job \nshortly after he graduated college. It is clear that he let his finances slip away from him \nfor a period. His wife was mostly handling the finances and neither one of them had a \nfull grasp of their situation. Debts became delinquent. About two years ago, he and his \nwife sat down, talked about what went wrong, and developed a comprehensive plan and \nbudget for correcting the situation. He has resolved all his delinquent debt and has not \naccrued any new delinquent debt in several years. Applicant has clearly matured in the \nlast several years. His finances are now in very good shape.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

MacKinnon, Esquire, Deputy Chief Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n________________ \n \nDecision \n________________ \n \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nconclude that Applicant has mitigated the concerns raised under the guideline for \nFinancial Considerations. Accordingly, her request for a position of public trust is \ngranted. \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) on June \n29, 2007 to apply for a position involving access to sensitive information. After reviewing \nthe results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \n  \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nApril 20, 2009\n\n \nOn August 5, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nspecifying that its decision was based on concerns addressed in the Directive under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 In \nher Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized on August 23, 2008, Applicant requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. She also admitted all SOR allegations except \n1.b., 1.d., 1.l. and 1.m. At the hearing, the government moved that allegation 1.l. be \ndismissed, and I granted that motion.  \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 14, 2008, and the \ncase was assigned to me January 14, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nJanuary 29, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 18, 2009. \nDuring the hearing, the government\u2019s exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6, were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and presented the \ntestimony of one witness. She also offered six exhibits, which were marked as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F and admitted without objection.3 DOHA received \nthe transcript on February 24, 2009. I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional documentation. She timely submitted four documents, which Deputy Chief \nDepartment Counsel forwarded without objection. I admitted them as AE G through J. \nand the record closed on March 4, 2009. Applicant was unable to obtain a document \nfrom a state Department of Revenue by deadline. However, on March 31, 2009, the \nDeputy Chief Department Counsel forwarded the additional document that Applicant had \nbeen unable to obtain earlier. The Deputy Chief Department Counsel had no objection to \nadmission of the document, and I re-opened the record and admitted it as AE K.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of \nReasons, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old Travel and Training Coordinator. She married in 1999, \nand earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001 (GE 1). When she was a college student, \nbetween 1992 and 1998, she responded to the numerous credit card offers that she \nreceived and soon realized that she was unable to pay the debt she had accrued. She \nfiled a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, which was discharged in 1999. Before becoming a \n                                                 \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President \non December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and \nthey apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after \nSeptember 1, 2006. \n3 AE A through F were originally attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR. At hearing, they were \nsevered from the Answer and admitted as exhibits for administrative convenience. \n \n2\n\n \ntravel and training coordinator, Applicant was employed as a driver for a florist and as an \nadministrative assistant for a retail store, and later, for two temporary agencies. She lived \nin five states between 1999 and 2004 (GE 1).4  \n \nIn 2004, Applicant and her husband operated a business, which failed to generate \nincome. They had applied for and received the appropriate state business license, but \nbefore leaving the state, they failed to file their state business tax return. Applicant \naccepts blame for this failure, as she believed that she was not required to file a \nbusiness tax return because the business had not earned a profit. She notified the state \nDepartment of Revenue in 2004 that she had moved and had not filed the return. She \nalso contacted the department in 2006, but did not resolve the issue, and has not been in \ncontact since then. Mail from the department could have been lost because of her \nrelocations to several other states (Tr 40-43). Applicant paid $165 in February 2009 (AE \nH), and the state lien was discharged the following month (AE K). \n \nIn 2004, when Applicant lived in Seattle, her husband was employed, but his \nincome was sufficient to meet only their rent and basic living expenses. Applicant was \nemployed as a temporary worker (GE 1). They used credit cards for medical and other \nexpenses, and eventually could not meet the credit card payments (Tr 23-24). \nApplicant's husband received a job offer in another state and they moved in late 2004. \nApplicant was unable to find employment for seven months. At least four of the alleged \ndebts became delinquent in this period (allegations 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g.) Applicant \nand her husband realized that, without two incomes, they would not be able to pay their \ndebts. They contacted a financial counseling service and started a monthly payment plan \nof $350 per month. Applicant found work the following month, when she was hired as a \ntravel and training coordinator in July 2005 (GE 1). According to the counseling service, \nApplicant and her husband \u201c\u2026made considerable progress demonstrating the intent to \npay the unsecured debt.\u201d (AE B). Over a period of almost two years, from June 2005 to \nApril 2007, they paid into the plan a total of approximately $8,300 (GE 4; AE B). \n \n \nWhile they were both employed, from July 2005 to Fall 2006, they tried to keep up \ntheir car payments to avoid repossession. However, in November 2006, Applicant's \nhusband was laid off. They could no longer make the car payments and they allowed \ntheir cars to be voluntarily repossessed. They were able to obtain high-interest \u201cbad \ncredit\u201d loan, and purchased a car. They share the one car and use public transportation \n(Tr 27-28). They continued making payments to the counseling service for several \nmonths after Applicant's husband became unemployed. However, they could not meet \nboth their daily living expenses and the monthly payments on a single income (Tr 22). \nThey discontinued the payment plan in April 2007. The credit bureau reports show that at \nleast four debts (allegations 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., and 1.m.) became delinquent in 2007 when \n                                                 \n4 These dates are listed in Applicant's security clearance application. She testified to slightly different \ndates, but admitted she was uncertain of the exact years (Tr 60-62). \n \n3\n\n \nApplicant's husband was unemployed (GE 2). Applicant's husband remained \nunemployed for approximately nine months. \n \n \nIn July 2007, Applicant's husband found a position,5 but was underemployed (Tr \n63). Their joint incomes were insufficient to cover their expenses, and they had a \nnegative cash flow (GE 3; Tr 30). Applicant made changes to their lifestyle to reduce \nexpenses, including shopping at less expensive grocery stores, limiting and then ending \ntheir entertainment expenses, and having one take-out pizza per month instead of eating \nout. Since May 2008, they also cut their miscellaneous expenses in half, from $200 per \nmonth to $100 per month, and reduced their car expense from $800 to $565 per month \n(GE 3; Tr 64-65). They used the utility company\u2019s budget plan that offers a set utility \npayment each month, but they were unable to pay the excess amounts that occasionally \nwere required (Tr 31-32). They cancelled their credit accounts, and currently have no \ncredit cards (Tr 67). \n \n \nApplicant's husband again became unemployed in June 2008 (Tr 28). However, \nhe had started his own private investigation business the previous December. He could \nnot accept clients until in June 2008, when he received his license (Tr 21; 35). The \nincome sheet for her husband\u2019s business shows his net income between December \n2008 and February 2009 was $12,332 (AE I). He is also seeking any possible outside \nemployment, but because of the poor job market, his health, and his high education \nlevel, he has not been successful (Tr 36-37). \n \nApplicant's husband has chronic medical problems including diabetes, high blood \npressure, and heart disease. His job from July 2007 to June 2008 required standing for \nlong hours on concrete floors. His current business requires less physical effort and \nplaces less strain on his heart (Tr 63). Applicant was approved for an employer-\nsponsored program that provides reimbursement of the cost of her husband\u2019s \nprescriptions, which cost $300 per month.  \n \nThe 14 debts alleged in the SOR include four judgments, the state tax lien, \nseveral credit card debts, the balance on a car loan, and past-due rent. Applicant admits \nthe debts, except for allegations 1.b., 1.d., 1.l., and 1.m. Allegation 1.b., involves a \njudgment of $171 owed to an animal hospital. She stated that she paid this debt but, \nbecause of its age, she no longer has supporting documentation. The judgment was \nentered in 1998, and does not appear on her 2008 credit bureau report (GE 2). Applicant \nalso denies allegation 1.d., the state tax lien, and has provided proof that it has been \n                                                 \n5 The record is ambiguous on when Applicant's husband returned to work. On page 23 of the transcript, \nand in GE 3, Applicant states her husband found employment in July 2007; on page 28-29 she states he \nreturned to work in November 2007. As GE 3 is dated May 2008, which is closer in time to the event in \nquestion, I find that the date provided there, July 2007, is most likely accurate. \n \n \n4\n\n \n \n5\ndischarged (AE K). She denies allegation 1.l., and the government has withdrawn this \nallegation (Tr. 7). Finally, she denies the judgment at allegation 1.m., which involves \nunpaid rent. Applicant paid the judgment, and subsequently, in July 2008, her lease was \nrenewed by the same lessor who filed the judgment (AE D). She also provided proof that \nas of February 17, 2009, she owed only the current month\u2019s rent (AE A).  \n \n \nApplicant has made efforts to deal with her debts. She has tried to work out plans \nwith individual creditors directly by telephone, but most demanded full payment and were \nunwilling to agree to payment plans. She can no longer use the credit counseling service \nbecause the service will not consider her husband\u2019s self-employment income, and her \nincome alone is insufficient to cover a payment plan (Tr 34-35). She has also \napproached her supervisor for assistance. When she and her husband were facing \neviction proceedings, she turned to her coworkers. According to her supervisor, they first \nconsidered a car wash, but decided to ask for donations from Applicant's team of 12 \ncoworkers. They responded, and the eviction was avoided. (Tr 73-74). Applicant also \nsought to convert her unused vacation hours to a cash payment, but this request was \nrefused because it was against company policy. Applicant and her husband have \nconsidered bankruptcy, but hope to avoid it by resolving their debts once her husband\u2019s \nbusiness generates more income (Tr 22).  \n \n \nApplicant's supervisor testified that her job performance has consistently earned \nexcellent reviews. Her supervisors received an unsolicited letter from a military officer \nattesting to Applicant's \u201cflawless\u201d work and her \u201coutstanding, sustained high quality \nperformance.\u201d (AE F). She was graded \u201cexceeds our expectation\u201d in numerous \ncategories of her 2007 through 2009 evaluations (AE E). Her supervisor noted that \nApplicant is open about her financial problems, logical in her approach, and is working \nhard to bring her debts under control. She is extremely trustworthy, strict about following \nrules, and seeks to maintain confidentiality. For instance, Applicant requested a privacy \nscreen over her computer monitor so that people in the immediate area would not be \nable to see clients\u2019 confidential information on her computer screen (Tr 51). \n \n \nApplicant's wage statement for December 1 through December 15, 2008, showed \ngross wages of $2,624. After deductions, her net income was $1,814. At the hearing, she \nestimated her monthly income at approximately $3,600. Her net income for the year, as \nof December 15, 2008, was $41,885 (AE J). In May 2008, she and her husband had a \nnegative monthly net remainder of $22 (GE 3). She estimates that they are now \u201cstarting \nto break even\u201d (Tr 66). Periodically, they receive help from the family of about $200 per \nmonth (Tr 66). \n \nPolicies \n \nEach trustworthiness decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \n\n \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).6 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition under any \nguideline does not determine a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against \nthem, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to \nsensitive information. \n \nA trustworthiness decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest7 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to sensitive information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke an Applicant\u2019s access to sensitive information. Additionally, the \ngovernment must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the \ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or \nmitigate the government\u2019s case. \n                                                \n \nA person who has access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as \nhers or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of \nthe government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \n \n6 Directive. 6.3. \n7 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).  \n \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00a72(b). \n \n6\n\n \n \n7\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may \nlead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe facts presented support application of two disqualifying conditions: AG \n\u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). Applicant started with a clean financial slate after her \nbankruptcy in 1999. However, a series of circumstances occurred over the past ten \nyears that resulted in mounting delinquencies. Applicant's inability to satisfy these \ndebts stemmed from unemployment/underemployment, and her husband\u2019s serious \nmedical problems. The record shows no evidence that her debts resulted from frivolous \nspending, drug or alcohol abuse, gambling, or other such factors. \n \n \nThe financial considerations guideline includes factors that can mitigate \ndisqualifying conditions. Three mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b620(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation], and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b620(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b620(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts. \n \nWhen an Applicant's indebtedness results primarily from events that she could \nnot control, mitigating condition AG \u00b620(b) might apply. Here, Applicant\u2019s indebtedness \ndid not stem from negligence toward her debts, but from repeated periods of \nunemployment, and her husband\u2019s medical problems. Between 2004 and 2008, either \nApplicant or her husband was unemployed or underemployed during five separate \nperiods. In 2004, Applicant's husband was underemployed and Applicant had a \ntemporary job. They were only able to meet their basic living expenses. Later that year, \nher husband found employment in another state, but after they moved, Applicant was \nunemployed for seven months. In November 2006, Applicant's husband was laid off, \nand remained unemployed for nine months. Although he found a position at that time, \n\n \n \n8\nhe was underemployed and they had a negative cash flow. Again, in June 2008, \nApplicant's husband lost his job. Finally, Applicant's husband\u2019s medical expenses for \nthree major chronic diseases added medical bills, prescription costs, and limitations on \nthe types of work he could perform. Despite these situations, Applicant and her \nhusband acted responsibly by reducing their living expenses wherever possible, and \nestablishing a payment plan during the time when they had sufficient income to meet it. \nMitigating condition AG \u00b620(b) applies. \n \n \nMitigating Conditions 20(c) and 20(d) also apply. Although Applicant's debts are \nnot paid, she made good-faith efforts to resolve them. In 2005, when both she and her \nhusband were employed, they realized that they could not solve their financial \nproblems on their own, and contacted a counseling service. They established a plan to \npay their creditors. The fact that they consistently met the large monthly payment for \nalmost two years shows their desire to meet their obligations, and demonstrates a \nprolonged good-faith effort. Based on Applicant's reasonable efforts in the face of \npersistent difficulties, I find for the Applicant on Guideline F.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant access to \nsensitive information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the appropriate \nguideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nThe record shows that Applicant accrued significant debt over the past ten \nyears, which raises security concerns about irresponsibility and the possibility for \ncoercion. However, Applicant's efforts to meet her obligations, in the face of the \ncontinual challenges of unemployment and her husband\u2019s serious medical problems, \ndemonstrate her reliability and mature response to a difficult situation. She made \n\n \n \n9\nconsistent payments toward her debts for almost two years, when she was financially \nable, showing that she is concerned about meeting her obligations. She cut the family\u2019s \nexpenses as much as possible. She testified candidly about her debts and her efforts \nto resolve them, and her co-workers are aware of her situation, relieving concerns \nabout susceptibility to coercion. Applicant credibly testified that she is conscientious \nabout protecting her clients\u2019 personal information. Applicant's supervisor confirmed that \nshe follows company rules, and despite her financial problems, is an outstanding and \nvalued employee. Her trustworthiness and good judgment are not at issue.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access to sensitive information. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.k: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n(withdrawn by the government) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m - 1.o. \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to sensitive \ninformation.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 1, 2006. On June \n12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines G and E. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nFebruary 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on June 26, 2009; answered it on July 15, 2009; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on July \n17, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 9, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on October 20, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October \n27, 2009, scheduling the hearing for November 19, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 12 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, which \nwere admitted without objection. I kept the record open until December 4, 2009 to \nenable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX E \nthrough G, which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to \nAX E through G is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I.1 DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on December 4, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.j \nand 2.a. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old mainframe technician employed by a federal \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since June 2008. He is a high \nschool graduate. He received a security clearance in June 2000 and retained it as of the \ndate of the hearing (GX at 28; Tr. 6). \n \nApplicant was married in March 1984 and divorced in August 2002. No children \nwere born during the marriage. He described the break-up of his marriage as \u201cnasty,\u201d \n\u201cmessy,\u201d accompanied by financial problems, and involving a dispute over the \ndisposition of the family home (Tr. 33, 74, 82-83). He has been in a \u201ccommitted \nrelationship\u201d with a registered pharmacist since April 2007. They have lived together \nsince June 2008 (AX C-1). \n \nApplicant previously worked for federal contactors from June 1999 to June 2008. \nAn annual performance appraisal for the period ending in June 2001 rated him as \n\u201cexemplary,\u201d the highest rating (AX A-1). A probationary performance review from his \ncurrent employer, dated October 1, 2008, rated him as very knowledgeable, self-\nmotivated, detail-oriented, creative, dedicated, and a team player (AX A-2).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s agency received a Department of Defense Joint Meritorious Unit \nAward in October 2002 (AX A-3). He was personally commended on several occasions \nfor his work with a previous employer (AX A-4 and A-5). In his current job, he has \ncontinued to gather frequent commendations for his expertise, dedication, and attention \nto detail (AX A-5 through A-8). \n \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit I referred to the three post-hearing submissions as AX D through F. I have corrected the \nlettering to reflect that AX D was admitted during the hearing and that AX E through G were submitted \nafter the hearing.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn May 1999, Applicant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while \nintoxicated (OWI), after he struck another vehicle that was stopped for a red light. He \nfailed several field sobriety tests and declined to take a breathalyzer test because he \nbelieved it would be used against him in the processing of his security clearance \napplication (GX 7 at 2; GX 12 at 2). In July 1999, he was sentenced to 120 days in jail, \nwith all but two days suspended. He was placed on unsupervised probation for one year \nand fined $1,000 (GX 4 at 2). He was required to pay $225 for court-appointed attorney \nfees, pay restitution of $250 for damage to the victim\u2019s vehicle, submit to a substance \nabuse evaluation at his own expense, and submit to treatment if the evaluation \nindicated it was needed (GX 11). He was evaluated and diagnosed with alcohol abuse. \nHe testified that the counseling consisted of one session lasting one or two hours and \nwas not very effective (Tr. 51).  \n \n \nIn September 1999, Applicant submitted an affidavit to a security investigator. In \nhis affidavit, he stated he began consuming alcohol in 1976, while he was in high \nschool. From 1976 to 1979, he consumed about three beers a day during the week and \nabout 20 beers on the weekend. He abstained from alcohol from 1979 to 1990 or 1991, \nand then began drinking about five beers a week. From October 1998 to June 1999, he \nwas unemployed and depressed, and he drank 60 to 70 beers a week. He then reduced \nhis consumption to about five beers a week plus five or six beers on his bowling night \n(GX 12 at 2). \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant recanted parts of his September 1999 affidavit. He \ntestified that he did not begin consuming alcohol until 1995, and that he did not recall \ntelling the investigator that he began drinking in 1976 (Tr. 57).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s OWI arrest in May 1999 was not his first instance of driving while \nintoxicated. He testified that his drinking and driving occurred when he went bowling, \nand that he drove while under the influence of alcohol at least once a week before his \narrest (Tr. 52-53). \n \n \nIn April 2003, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) (GX 4 at \n2). He was stopped for erratic driving and found to have a blood-alcohol level of .18%. \nHe pleaded guilty to careless and imprudent driving and was ordered to attend group \ncounseling sessions three times per week for three weeks. He entered a clinical \nintervention program in June 2003 and completed it in July 2003 (GX 3 at 11-12). \n \n \nApplicant was again arrested for DWI in March 2004 (GX 4 at 2). He fell asleep \nat a traffic light after leaving a bowling alley. His car rolled forward and struck another \ncar. He drove away from the scene but was arrested. His blood-alcohol was .20%. He \npleaded guilty to careless and imprudent driving and was ordered to attend weekend \ntreatment (GX 2 at 3). He completed the program in June 2004 (GX at 14). \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in March 2005 for driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI). He was convicted and placed on probation for two years and ordered to seek \ncounseling (GX 1 at 25; GX 2 at 3). He attended counseling three times a week from \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAugust 2005 to January 2006 (GX 3 at 5). He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent and \nsuffering from severe depression that resulted from the death of his parents and his \nestrangement from his sister for fifteen years (GX 2 at 5; AX B-1 at 4). The counseling \nwas provided by a \u201ccertified reciprocal alcohol and other drug abuse counselor\u201d \n(CRADC)2, with a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work, who was licensed to provide \nintervention and treatment for adult outpatient DUI evaluation and DUI risk education \n(AX E, F, and G). Applicant testified that the CRADC was the first to \u201cget through [his] \nhead\u201d and convince him to make drastic changes in his lifestyle (Tr. 43). He also \ntestified he is very afraid of going back to his old lifestyle (Tr. 46). Applicant completed \nthe required counseling in January 2006. The prognosis from the CRADC was \nfavorable, but it was contingent on Applicant following his aftercare plan, which included \nparticipation in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) (AX B-1 at 3).  \n \nApplicant began his aftercare treatment and began participating in AA in August \n2009, more than three years after completing the counseling. He described the \naftercare program as a \u201cfour hour ordeal\u201d each week. He qualified this description by \nexplaining that the meetings lasted for an hour and a half but that it took an hour to drive \neach way to and from the meeting (Tr. 69-70). He completed the aftercare program \nabout three weeks before the hearing (Tr. 44). When asked why he waited so long to \ninitiate his aftercare plan, he testified he was focused on remodeling his house and \ntrying to sell it (Tr. 66-67).  \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in May 2007, he stated he had \nreduced his alcohol consumption to less than six beers a month and that he was no \nlonger drinking to intoxication (GX 2 at 6). In August 2008, he responded to DOHA \ninterrogatories, stating that he last consumed alcohol when he drank one beer with \ndinner on his birthday in August 2007 (GX 3 at 3). In response to the same \ninterrogatories, Applicant submitted an evaluation from a licensed clinical social worker, \nwho opined that he did not have an alcohol-related problem when he was evaluated on \nAugust 8, 2008 (GX 3 at 9; AX B-2). \n \n \nAs of mid-October 2009, Applicant had been attending AA meetings once a week \nfor three months (AX B-6). He has an AA sponsor. He informed the CRADC that he \nintended to join an additional AA group and attend its meetings once a week (AX B-3). \nThe CRADC believed he was motivated to change his lifestyle and avoid future alcohol-\nrelated problems. On October 19, 2009, the CRADC changed his diagnosis from \nalcohol dependence to alcohol abuse (AX B-4 at 5-6).   \n \n \nApplicant testified that all his alcohol-related driving offenses occurred while \nbowling in a highly competitive league. Since his DUI conviction in 2005, he has given \nup competitive bowling, and he has surrounded himself with a different group of friends \n(Tr. 42). At the hearing, he submitted an affidavit stating that he has not consumed any \nalcohol since August 2007, that he will not consume any alcohol in the future, that he is \nwilling to submit to any testing or evaluation deemed appropriate, and that if he is \n                                                          \n2  This acronym does not incorporate the entire description of his credentials, but it is the official acronym \non his professional license. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nallowed to keep his security clearance, he agrees that any future alcohol-related \nincident will cause his clearance to be revoked without any challenge from him (AX B-\n7). \n \n \nApplicant submitted a previous security clearance application in July 1999, in \nwhich he disclosed the OWI arrest in May 1999 (AX D at 5). When he submitted his \nsecurity clearance application in June 2006, he disclosed the alcohol-related arrests in \n2003, 2004, and 2005, but he did not disclose the 1999 OWI arrest. He told a security \ninvestigator his failure to disclose the 1999 arrest was intentional (GX 2 at 4). He \ntestified he was going through major stresses at the time his submitted his 1999 \napplication, and he was afraid of losing his job if he disclosed the 1999 OWI arrest (Tr. \n49). \n \n \nApplicant also did not disclose the 1999 arrest to the CRADC who treated him in \n2005 (AX B-1). He testified he did not recall why he failed to disclose it to the CRADC \n(Tr. 64-65). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s companion describes him as a \u201cgreat man\u201d who takes great pride in \nhis work (AX C-1). His companion\u2019s brother has never suspected that Applicant was still \ndrinking. He considers Applicant very dedicated and generous (AX C-5). His \ncompanion\u2019s sister-in-law also describes him as warm, caring, and conscientious (AX C-\n6). Two social friends who have known Applicant for three years consider him to be \nhonest, reliable, hard working, conscientious, and courteous (AX C-2; AX C-7). Two \ncolleagues describe him as knowledgeable, dedicated, and caring (AX C-3; AX C-8). \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor regards him as very personable, diligent, honest, reliable, \nand stable (AX C-4). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the \npoint of intoxication, from at least May 1999 to at least August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It \nalleges he was charged with OWI in May 1999, received alcohol counseling in May \n1999, and was diagnosed with alcohol abuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c). It alleges that he was \ncharged with DWI in April 2003, pleaded guilty to a lesser offense, and received alcohol \ncounseling in June and July 2003, and was diagnosed with alcohol dependence (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1,d-1.e). It alleges that he was charged with DWI in March 2004, pleaded guilty to a \nlesser offense, and completed two days of alcohol counseling in June 2004 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.f-1.g). It alleges that he was arrested for DUI in July 2005, pleaded guilty to DUI, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nreceived court-ordered alcohol counseling from September 2005 to January 2006, and \nwas diagnosed with alcohol dependence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.i). Finally, it alleges that \nApplicant continued to consume alcohol after completing the court-ordered counseling \nin January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.j. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nbut I conclude it is supported by his arrest record and his admission at the hearing that \nhe consumed alcohol in August 2007. \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d The following potentially disqualifying conditions are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence. . . , regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \nAG \u00b6 22(e): evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program; and  \nAG \u00b6 22(f): relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and \ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. \n \nAll four disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. Although the \nevidence reflects that Applicant consumed only a single beer after completing his \nalcohol rehabilitation program in January 2007, the single drink is sufficient to constitute \na \u201crelapse\u201d within the meaning of AG \u00b6 22(f).  \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), (c), (e), and (f), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). The first prong of this \nmitigating condition focuses on whether the conduct was recent. There are no Abright \nline@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based \non a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last instance of excessive drinking was in July 2005, more than four \nyears ago. He consumed one beer in August 2007, and he has abstained from alcohol \nsince then. He has found new friends, responded favorably to the court-ordered \ncounseling he completed in January 2006, and found a new romantic relationship. He \nhas changed jobs and earned the respect of his current supervisor. Applicant\u2019s belated \ncompletion of the aftercare program and participation in AA appear to have been \nmotivated in large part by his pending hearing and the realization that his security \nclearance was at risk. Nevertheless, he appears to have changed his lifestyle and is \ndetermined to remain abstinent from alcohol. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(a) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). For the reasons set \nout above concerning AG \u00b6 23(a), I conclude AG \u00b6 23(b) is established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated under AG \u00b6 \n23(d) if \u2014 \n \n[T]he individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nFor the reasons set out above, I conclude that this mitigating condition also is \nestablished. Although the favorable prognosis in this case was provided by a CRADC \nrather than a medical doctor or licensed clinical social worker, his certification, license to \npractice, and educational qualifications are sufficiently similar to those of a licensed \nclinical social worker to warrant application of this mitigating condition. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of intent, willingness to undergo testing, and agreement \nthat any alcohol-related incidents will result in revocation of his clearance does not fall \nunder any of the enumerated mitigating conditions under this Guideline. Nevertheless, it \nis patterned on the statement of intent specifically enumerated in AG \u00b6 26(b)(4) under \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement), and it is relevant in determining the strength and \nsincerity of Applicant\u2019s intent to abstain from using alcohol.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified material facts on his security clearance \napplication by intentionally failing to disclose his OWI arrest in March 1999 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nHe admitted this allegation in his response to the SOR and at the hearing. The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). Applicant admitted the intentional falsification in his answer \nto the SOR and at the hearing, thereby raising AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted \nwith the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant submitted his security clearance in June 2006, but \nhe made no effort to correct the intentional omission until he was interviewed by a \nsecurity investigator in May 2007. Even during this interview, he did not disclose the \nMay 1999 arrest until he was specifically asked if he had been arrested in the town \nwhere the arrest occurred. He then admitted being arrested for OWI in May 1999. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense \nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was not minor. It was \nintended to undermine the integrity of the security clearance process. It was a repeat of \nhis deception during the court-ordered counseling in 2005. He initially repeated the \ndeception during a security interview in May 2007, but he finally told the truth after \nfurther questioning. At the hearing he recanted his September 1999 affidavit, in which \nhe admitted a history of alcohol abuse beginning in 1976. His recantation means that \neither his affidavit or his hearing testimony was false. In light of this track record, I am \nnot satisfied that further attempts to deceive will not recur. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). For the reasons set out above in my \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6 17(c), I conclude this mitigating condition is not established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). Applicant receives some credit under this \nmitigating condition because he has finally disclosed the full extent of his alcohol abuse \nto his companion, friends, colleagues, and his supervisor. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who is technically proficient and very devoted to his \nwork. He has held a clearance for many years. He appears to have changed his lifestyle \nafter completing the court-ordered counseling, and alcohol abuse is no longer part of his \nlife. However, he has not overcome his tendency to minimize or conceal his past. He \ndeceived the CRADC, falsified his security clearance application, tried to deceive a \nsecurity investigator, and admitted the 1999 OWI arrest only after the investigator \nindicated he already knew about it. He recanted his September 1999 affidavit at the \nhearing. Considering these events and all the evidence together, I have doubts about \nhis reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nThe SOR does not allege Applicant\u2019s concealment of his May 1999 arrest from \nthe CRADC or his initial attempt to deceive the security investigator in May 2007. I have \nconsidered this conduct for the limited purpose of deciding which adjudicative guidelines \n\n \n11 \n \n \nare applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; \nto \nconsider \nwhether \nApplicant \nhas \ndemonstrated \nsuccessful \nrehabilitation; and as part of my whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on alcohol consumption, but he \nhas not mitigated the security concerns based on personal conduct. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Decision at 3.\n2\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 21, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant contends that\nthe Judge based his decision on his erroneous  belief that Applicant still uses illegal drugs.  Applicant\nalso argues that the Judge did not give adequate weight to the character references she submitted.\nFinding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\n  The Judge made the following relevant factual findings: Applicant is 53 years old.\nApplicant bought and used an illegal substance with varying frequency from approximately 1990\nuntil 2003 or 2004.  From 1990 until 2001, her usage was approximately two days per month.\nApplicant sought counseling in 2001 and underwent treatment for approximately a year.  Then in\n2003 or 2004, Applicant bought and used the illegal substance once and became sick.  In response\nto a question on her Security Clearance Application, Applicant falsely denied her drug use.\nApplicant is incorrect in stating that the Judge based his decision on a belief that Applicant\ncontinues to use illegal drugs.  In fact, the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to the Guideline H\nallegations in the SOR, concluding that Applicant\u2019s abstinence since 2003 or 2004 was sufficient\nto mitigate the government\u2019s concerns as to her drug involvement.   Decision at 5.\n1\nApplicant argues that the Judge did not give adequate weight to the character references she\nsubmitted.  The Judge stated that he considered Applicant\u2019s five letters of reference.   However, the\n2\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security\nclearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2007). \nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant under Guidelines H and E and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and factors.   The Judge found sufficient evidence of mitigation to rule in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor as to Guideline H, but reasonably explained why the evidence Applicant had presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline E.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient\n\n3\nto demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 08-01105 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 15,  2008).

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on March 16, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nApril 30, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 11, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing on August  11, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Government offered Exhibits 1\nthrough 4, which were received and entered into evidence without objection. Applicant\ntestified on her own behalf, and she submitted no exhibits. At the request of Applicant,\nthe record remained open until August 25, 2009, to allow Applicant to offer post hearing\ncharacter letters. Five letters were submitted, and have been entered into evidence\n\n2\nwithout objection collectively as Exhibit A. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr) on August 19, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations; 1.a., under Guideline\nE, and 2.a. through 2.c., under Guideline H. The admitted allegations are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 53 years old. She is not married, and she has one daughter.\nApplicant works for a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with her employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she exhibited conduct involving questionable judgement, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\n1.a. Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), on August 10,\n2006 (Exhibit 1).  Question #24 of the SCA asked since the age of 16 or in the previous\nseven years, whichever is shorter, had Applicant illegally used any controlled\nsubstance? Applicant answered \"No\" to this question, and she listed no illegal\nsubstances. The Government alleges, and the evidence is clear, that Applicant should\nhave included her regular methamphetamine usage which continued until 2001, and\nwas within seven years of her completion of the SCA, and her one time usage in 2003\nor 2004, as included and discussed in subparagraph 2.a., below. \nAt the hearing Applicant testified that she did not list her methamphetamine\nusage up until 2001, because she thought it had been more than seven years since her\nlast regular usage of methamphetamine. After some testimony in which she\nequivocated about her memory of her usage in 2003, she conceded that she knew of\nher one time usage in 2003 or 2004, but she testified, \u201cAnd the reason I didn\u2019t put that\none time \u2018cause, hey, it was one time, it was a bad experience.\u201d (Tr at 40-42).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists three allegations regarding illegal drug involvement under\nAdjudicative Guideline H. As stated above, all of these allegations were admitted by\nApplicant in the RSOR. They will be discussed in the same order as they were listed in\nthe SOR:\n\n3\n2.a. The SOR alleges that Applicant used methamphetamine, with varying\nfrequency, from approximately 1990 to at least 2003 or 2004. At the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that she used methamphetamine from 1990 to approximately 2001, and her\nusage was about two days a month. She used the methamphetamine to give her energy\nand to help her with weight loss (Tr at 24-27). After her treatment, discussed in 2.c.,\nbelow, she testified that she bought a \u201cbaggie\u201d in 2003 or 2004, and she only used\nmethamphetamine one additional time, but she became sick as a result of her use. She\naverred that she has not used it since then (Tr at 31-32).\n2.b. The SOR alleges that Applicant purchased methamphetamine.  She testified\nthat she purchased the methamphetamine that she used in the form of $20 \u201cbaggies,\u201d or\nat times $40 worth of drugs, from people she would see on the street corner, whom she\ndid not know personally (Tr at 28-29).\n  \n2.c.  The SOR alleges that Applicant sought counseling in approximately 2001,\nfor her methamphetamine use, because she believed she was having a problem with\nthe methamphetamine usage. After meeting with her counselor on two occasions, she\nwas referred to a psychiatrist for further treatment. She was treated by the psychiatrist\nfor one year. In Exhibit 3, Applicant stated that she received counseling \u201cfor about 1\nyear, once a month in 2001.\u201d\nMitigation\nAs reviewed above, Applicant submitted five character letters from individuals\nwho have known her in different capacities (Exhibit A). All of the letters were very\npositive in describing Applicant in such terms as \u201ctrustworthy, enthusiastic and\noptimistic.\u201d However, none of individuals who wrote the letters, addressed Applicant\u2019s\nhistory of methamphetamine usage. Since it is not clear if any of them were aware of\nApplicant\u2019s drug usage, I find their recommendations to be of limited value. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to\nthe Government incomplete, untruthful answers regarding the extent of her drug\ninvolvement on an SCA that she executed on August 10, 2006. The record is clear that\nshe was aware of her methamphetamine usage in 2003 or 2004, and that she\nknowingly failed to furnish that information to the Government. Regarding her regular\nusage that continued to at least 2001, I do not find it credible that she could not\nremember that her usage was within the seven years before she completed her SCA,\nparticularly since she was receiving treatment every month for one year in 2001,\nbecause of her problems with the drug. \nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely\ndifficult to conclude that she nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty\n\n5\nnecessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, I conclude that Applicant\nknowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers regarding her drug\nusage to the Government.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, I conclude that\nDC 16. (a) applies because of Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, and\nfalsification of relevant facts from a personnel security questionnaire, which was used to\ndetermine security clearance eligibility.\u201d I can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC)\napplies in this paragraph.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, exhibits questionable judgement,\nunreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Paragraph 1, Guideline E, against Applicant.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the possession, and use for many\nyears of methamphetamine is of great concern, especially in light of her desire to have\naccess to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her illegal\nsubstance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) 25.\n(a) \u201cany drug abuse\u201d and (c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution.\u201d\nBased on the Applicant\u2019s many years and frequency of  use of illegal substances,\nand her lack of candor concerning information about her drug involvement that she\nfurnished to the Government, her drug usage continues to be of concern. However, I do\nfind that Applicant\u2019s conduct of not using methamphetamine since 2003 or 2004, comes\nwithin MC 26. (b) \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\u201d such as\n(3) \u201can appropriate period of abstinence.\u201d \nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden under Guideline H of\nproving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs for many years.\nApplicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against\nher.  Accordingly, Paragraph 2 Guideline H of the SOR is concluded for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\n\n6\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines H and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s long history of using\nmethamphetamine, and her lack of honesty and candor with the information she\nfurnished to the Government, I find that the record evidence leaves me with serious\nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:   \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. -1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on June 12, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in\nthis case fall under Guideline H based on Applicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement (cocaine)\nand Guideline E for personal conduct. For the reasons discussed below, this case is\ndecided against Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nDecember 17, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received July 16, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me October 7, 2008. The hearing took place\nNovember 18, 2008, as scheduled pursuant to written notice. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived November 26, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement, the SOR alleges the following: (1) that\nApplicant used cocaine in 1986, 2006, June 2007, July 2007, and September 2007; (2)\nthat in June 2007 he was arrested and charged with the offenses of possession of a\ncontrolled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and driving while ability was\nimpaired (DWAI); (3) that he tested positive for cocaine in July 2007 during an alcohol\nevaluation before his court date; (4) that he tested positive for cocaine in September\n2007 while on probation; (5) that he cannot state that he would never use cocaine\nagain; and (6) that he used cocaine while holding a security clearance. Under Guideline\nE for personal conduct, the SOR alleges the following: (1) that he used cocaine while\nholding a security clearance; and (2) that he intentionally did not report the June 2007\ndrug charges to his employer.\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations under both\nguidelines. He also provided a one-page memorandum wherein he explained the\nsurrounding facts and circumstances and clarified some of his admissions. Based on\nthe record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial\nevidence.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has lived in the\nsame community since 1982. He has worked for the same employer since 1977. His\ncurrent position or job title is senior financial analyst and he works as a program\naccountant. He has held a security clearance, which he is seeking to retain, since about\n1998.  \nApplicant married in 1977 and divorced in 2006. The end of his marriage and the\ndivorce were devastating events for him and these events preceded his drug\ninvolvement and the criminal charges. Some but not all of his cocaine use occurred\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\n3\nwith a woman he met after his divorce. He has not associated with her for about a year\nand has no plans to associate with her further.            \nHis cocaine use came to light in June 2007 when he was arrested and charged\nwith the three criminal offenses. He reported the DWAI offense to his employer but not\nthe drug offenses because he was unsure what he was charged with until he made his\ninitial appearance in court. On advice of counsel, he sought treatment in July 2007,  was\nsubject to drug testing, and tested positive for cocaine. The court record indicates that\nthe offenses were disposed of and the sentence was imposed on July 23, 2007 (Exhibit\n3). The two drug offenses were dismissed (Applicant maintains the items found in the\ncar belonged to the woman) and he pleaded guilty to the DWAI offense. The court\nsentenced him to serve probation for 6 to 18 months. The court also imposed the\nfollowing conditions on the sentence: (1) to submit to an alcohol evaluation and\ntreatment; (2) to abstain from alcohol and drugs; (3) to submit to substance abuse\nmonitoring; (4) to serve 24 hours of community service; and (5) to pay a fine, costs, and\nfees. Applicant is still on probation, which he expects to end in January 2009.\nAbout two months after pleading guilty, he used cocaine in September 2007\nwhile on a camping trip. Subsequently, he tested positive for cocaine. Although this use\nviolated his probation, he was not prosecuted for it, but the probation office increased\nthe substance abuse monitoring.         \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator in October 2007 to discuss his\narrest (Exhibit 2). He described the circumstances surrounding his arrest, to include that\nhe used both alcohol and cocaine before his arrest. He also confirmed and provided\nadditional details about his cocaine use. \nHis most recent cocaine use took place in July 2008. He used it at a party to\ncelebrate his birthday. Subsequently, he tested positive for cocaine. Again, he was not\nprosecuted for this violation of his probation. \nConcerning his previous statement that he could not definitely state that he would\nnever use cocaine again, Applicant explained that he made this statement while\nundergoing treatment, was concerned about a relapse, and was being honest (Tr. 27).\nHe does not intend to return to his post-divorce lifestyle and he has taken steps to avoid\nfuture cocaine use. For example, his adult daughter recently moved into his home and\nhe believes her presence will be a stabilizing factor in his life.\n \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\n\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n5\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 17\u201318 (setting forth the security concern as well as the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n15\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n16\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n17\n5\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\n1.\nThe Drug Involvement Security Concern\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement,  the security concern is that \u201cuse of an\n14\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d  The definition of drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\n15\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d16\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following disqualifying conditions\napply to Applicant\u2019s case:\n\u2022\nAny drug abuse (see above definition); \n\u2022\nTesting positive for illegal drug use; and   \n\u2022\nAny illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.17\nApplicant\u2019s history of cocaine use raises security concerns because it calls into\nquestion his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to obey the law. His\ncocaine use on several occasions during the period 2006\u20132008 is relatively recent and\ntook place while holding a security clearance. Moreover, some of his cocaine use took\nplace while on probation. These circumstances show that Applicant used grossly poor\njudgment on multiple occasions.     \nThe four mitigating conditions under Guideline H have been considered and none\napply in Applicant\u2019s favor. The evidence in his favor is minimal, as his cocaine use is too\nrecent to be mitigated. And it is too soon to determine how he will progress and if his\nefforts will result in a permanent change in his behavior. What is missing here is a\nproven record of reform and rehabilitation that demonstrates his intent not to abuse\ndrugs in the future. Accordingly, Guideline H is decided against Applicant.    \n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n18\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n19\n6\n2.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n18\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n19\nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleged the circumstance that Applicant used cocaine  while holding a\nsecurity clearance. This allegation is redundant with and repetitive of SOR \u00b6 1.f. This\ncircumstance was adequately covered under Guideline H\u2014indeed, a specific DC\napplies to this circumstance\u2014and I gave this circumstance substantial weight.\nAdditional discussion under Guideline E would add little to the analysis, and it will make\nno difference in the ultimate outcome of the case. Accordingly, on this basis, this\nallegation is decided for Applicant.  \nIn SOR \u00b6 2.b the government asserts Applicant intentionally did not report the\npossession of paraphernalia offense to his employer. The government did not allege or\npresent any authority that Applicant was required to report this matter.  Accordingly, on\nthis basis, this allegation is decided for Applicant. \n3.\nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder the Directive, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant facts and circumstances. This analysis includes nine\nadjudicative factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n20\n7\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n20\nI considered these nine factors, as well as Applicant\u2019s longtime employment and\nthe circumstance that Applicant voluntarily reported his cocaine use when he was\ninterviewed in October 2007. I also considered the circumstance that some of his\ncocaine use was likely tied to the end of his marriage, which had a significant effect on\nhim. In short, an analysis under the whole-person concept is insufficient to overcome\nthe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s cocaine use. \nA core value or principle of the industrial security clearance program is that the\ngovernment must have confidence that those people with access to classified\ninformation can be relied on to exercise good judgment. Based on the record evidence,\nApplicant remains under a cloud of doubt due to his history of cocaine use during the\nperiod 2006\u20132008. Without a proven record of reform and rehabilitation, the record\nevidence is not sufficient to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the drug involvement security\nconcerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.b:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has one unpaid judgment and 12 unpaid accounts, which have been \ncharged off or have been placed for collection and total in excess of $16,000. Applicant \nrebutted the personal conduct security concerns related to her answers on her \nQuestionnaire for Public Trust Positions. However, she has failed to rebut or mitigate \nthe government\u2019s security concerns about her finances. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto sensitive information and eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \n1 \nJuly 13, 2009\n\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated \nJan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nOn August 25, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On \nMarch 10, 2009, I was assigned the case. On March 26, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing which was held on April 21, 2009. The government \noffered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified \nand submitted Exhibits A through F, which were admitted into evidence.  \n \nThe record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On \nApril 28, 2009 and May 14, 2009, additional documents were received. There being no \nobjection, the material was admitted into evidence as Ex. G and Ex. H. On April 29, \n2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, she denied the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.h, \n1.i, 1.l, and 1.p. She also denied falsifying her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. She admitted the remaining debts. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the \nSOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year old beneficiary service representative who has worked for \na health care provider since April 2007, and is seeking to obtain a public trust position. \nA coworker and friend states that Applicant is efficient, competent, and maintains \nexcellent rapport with people. Applicant\u2019s communication and customer service skills \nare excellent. (Ex. A) Applicant\u2019s December 2008 appraisal review states she is an \noutstanding employee and an asset to the company. (Ex. E) \n \n \nApplicant is married and has two children, ages 13 and 18, and additionally is \nraising her sister\u2019s children, twins age four. (Tr. 34, 36) Day care for the four-year olds is \n$360 per month. (Tr. 46) Prior to 1999, the jobs held by Applicant were temporary \npositions. (Tr. 27) In May 1999, she started what she described as a \u201csolid\u201d job. In \nDecember 1999, she, then age 23, and her husband purchased a home. (Tr. 32) She \ndescribes the purchase as \u201cthe worst thing I could have ever did because I wasn\u2019t really \nprepared for all what goes in it. I was young, dumb, basically, so we made a lot of \nmistakes.\u201d (Tr. 27, 32) They purchased the home for $63,000 with $624 monthly \npayments. In 2006, they sold the home.  \n \nIn 2006, her husband joined the U.S. Army. From October 2006 until April 2007, \nApplicant was unemployed due to her relocation when her husband was transferred to \nhis current duty assignment. (Tr. 35) In April 2007, she obtained her current job.  \n \n2 \n\n \nIn September 2005, an $11,554 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1a) was entered against \nApplicant for payment of a water treatment program. In October 2006, when the home \nwas sold, the water treatment judgment was paid and the judgment satisfied. (Ex. B, Ex. \nC) At the time of sale, the mortgage payments were delinquent. Applicant had been \nunaware of any judgments or liens on the house until settlement. (Tr. 37)  \n \n \nIn April 2007, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF \n85P). Question 22(a) asked if she or a company over which she exercised some control \nhad filed for bankruptcy, been subject to a tax lien, or had a judgment rendered against \nher. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d because she did not own or have control over a company. \n(Tr. 33)  \n \n \nQuestion 22(b) asked if she was 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial \nobligation at the time she completed her questionnaire. She thought question 22(b) was \nconnected to question 22(a) and did not see them as separate questions. (Tr. 33) She \nagain marked \u201cno\u201d because she did not own or control a company. She asserted she \nmarked the question wrong. At the hearing, Applicant admitted she had debts more than \n180 days delinquent when her SF 85P was completed. (Answer to SOR) \n \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant answered written interrogatories concerning her \njudgments and delinquent accounts. (Ex. 2) She asserted the judgment listed in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a ($11,554) was paid when she sold her home. She stated she had made no \npayments on the following accounts: $2,849 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $15,057 \nrepossession (SOR \u00b6 1.c); $304 telephone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $368 bank account placed \nfor collection (SOR \u00b6 1.f); three medical bills placed for collection in the amounts of \n$265 (SOR \u00b6 1.i), $141 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), $50 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); $78 water bill placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m); $212 returned check placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.n); $60 returned \ncheck placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.o); and $264 telephone service account placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.p). (Ex. 2)  \n \n \nIn her May 2008 answer to interrogatories, Applicant stated she had two \ninterviews concerning her debts. She has worked in the same field for nine years and \nher prior employer was another government medical program. (Ex. 2)  \n \n \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant attempted to contact a number of her creditors \nto verify her obligations, but has been unable to verify the debts. (Ex. G). She contacted \nthe following creditors: the collection agency collecting for a past due water bill (SOR \u00b6 \n1.m, $78); charged off bank account (SOR \u00b6 1.d, $1,049); collection agency collecting \nfor account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.g, $203); telephone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.e, $304); \nbank account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.f, $368); and a vacuum cleaner judgment \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b, $2,849). (Ex. G) Of these creditors, the only payment made was $85 to the \ncollection agency collecting a past due water bill (SOR \u00b6 1.m, $78). (Ex. H) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s salary is $900 every two weeks. (Tr. 42) Her husband\u2019s monthly take \nhome pay is $1,200. (Tr. 42) Their combined monthly gross income is $3,000. Applicant \nwould like to pay her creditors. (Tr. 32) She acknowledges some of the debts are not \n3 \n\nlarge. She has attended some financial classes. (Tr. 33) She now checks her credit \nreport annually. Lately, she has not had any checks returned for insufficient funds. (Tr. \n48) She is current on all of her debts except those listed in the SOR and is not being \ncontacted by creditors about her debts. (Tr. 34) She is working on establishing a \nmonthly budget. She has $85 automatically deducted from per pay check which goes to \nher 401(k) retirement fund. (Tr. 47) She has no savings.  \n \n \nA current summary of her debts follows: \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount Current Status \na Judgment for water \ntreatment.  \n$11,554\nPaid. (Ex. B, Ex.

The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \n \n5 \n\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness \nconcerns relating to financial problems: \n \n6 \n\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a public trust position. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant has one unpaid judgment and 12 unpaid accounts which were \ncharged-off or placed for collection, which total in excess of $16,000. Ten of the debts \nare under $400 each, which together total less than $2,000. Disqualifying Conditions \nAG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n7 \n\n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nIn 2006, when Applicant sold her home, the judgment listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a \n($11,554) and the past due amount owed on this account (SOR \u00b6 1.l, $974) were paid. \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant paid the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.m, ($78). The remaining \njudgment and 12 accounts, which have been charged off or placed for collection, remain \nunpaid. She had not contacted a number of these creditors for years. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. The debts are numerous and remain unpaid. The \ndebts do not appear to have been incurred under unusual circumstances or \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur.  \n \nAG & 20(b) partially applies. Applicant experienced periods of unemployment. \nShe was unemployed for six months before obtaining her current job in April 2007. \nApplicant has been employed full-time for more than two years. Her husband has been \nemployed full-time since 2006. She has been aware of the government\u2019s concern over \nher finances since May 2008 when she received the written interrogatories. In the past \nyear, she has been able to pay one $78 debt. She has not acted reasonably under the \ncircumstances.  \n \nAG & 20(c) does not apply. Applicant has received counseling and is current on \nher debts other than those listed in the SOR. However, she has more than $16,000 in \nunpaid obligations. There are no clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control.  \n \nAG & 20(d) applies to the two debts paid with the sale of her home in 2006 and \nthe small debt paid following the hearing. The payment of these three debts represents \na good-faith effort to repay these overdue creditors or otherwise resolve these debts.  \n \nApplicant disputes the amount of debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.p ($264), but \nacknowledges she owes the creditor some amount. Applicant stated she had last \ncontacted this creditor in 2005. For AG & 20(e) to apply there must be a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the debt and there must be documented proof to substantiate the basis \nof the dispute. There is no documentation showing Applicant has disputed the debt with \nthe creditor. AG & 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe Government has shown Applicant's answers to questions 22(a) and 22(b) on \nher SF 85P were incorrect, but this does not prove Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose information about her finances. Applicant denied any intentional falsification. \nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \n8 \n\ndocument or oral statement to the Government, when applying for a public trust \nposition, is a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A \nfalsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and \nwillfully.  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant impressed me as somewhat unsophisticated in financial \nmatters. She testified she thought the questions related to her as exercising control over \na company and so she answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions. Having observed Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor and listened to her testimony, Applicant=s explanation of her negative \nanswers on her SF 85P is plausible and credible. Her answers were not deliberate \nomissions, concealments, or falsifications. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant has been able to keep up with her current debts, but has been unable \nto address past due debts totaling in excess of $16,000. Applicant and her husband \nappear to be living paycheck to paycheck, with limited reserve funds for emergencies or \ntemporary periods of unemployment.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a public trust position. The awarding of eligibility for a public trust position is not a \nonce in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying \nand mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances \na position of public trust is not clearly consistent with national security, but should the \nApplicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a public trust position in the future, \nhaving paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance with a repayment plan, \n9 \n\n10 \nor otherwise addressed the obligations, she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence \nof her eligibility for a public trust position. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust \nposition. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from her financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l and 1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n \u2013 1.p:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information and eligibility for a \npublic trust position is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns raised\nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. Eligibility to occupy an automatic data\nprocessing position (ADP) is denied.\nOn October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing Financial Considerations\nconcerns related to her eligibility to occupy an ADP position. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 12, 2008, admitting the allegations,\nand requesting an administrative determination. On December 31, 2008, department\nApril 28, 2009\n\n2\ncounsel prepared a File of Relevant Materials (FORM). Applicant received it on January\n13, 2009. She did not respond. The case was assigned to me on March 24, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 32-year-old single woman with two children, ages 10 and five. She\nhas a high school diploma, and has earned some college credits (Item 4 at 4). For the\npast five years, she has worked for a health insurance company as a Medicare\nadvantage tester (Item 4 at 5). Her job duties are unknown from the record. She earns\napproximately $23,000 per year (Item 5 at 8).\nApplicant owes seven creditors approximately $28,000 of debt in various stages\nof delinquency (Items 5-7). The debts include two credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f) a bank\ndebt, (SOR \u00b6 1.b), auto loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.i), and a check cashing company\ndefault (SOR \u00b6 1.h). SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.e are duplicates (Item 6 at 2).\nThe SOR alleges an additional delinquency owed to a check cashing company\n(SOR \u00b6 1.g). This debt resulted in litigation between Applicant and the creditor. The\ncourt dismissed it (Item 5 at 3). I find in her favor as to SOR \u00b6 1.g.\nIn approximately June 2008, the government propounded interrogatories to\nApplicant regarding her delinquencies (Item 5). In her response, dated July 2, 2008, she\nstated that she \u201creally [did not] have the ability to pay off these old debts\u201d (Id. at 7). She\nreiterated her inability to pay these debts in her SOR answer (Item 3). She attributed her\nfinancial problems to difficulties raising two children as a single parent. She expressed\nan interest in working with a financial counselor. She has not retained one, yet.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability to have access to sensitive information,\nthe administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \n\n3\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, [and] trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s delinquencies\ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and\n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply.\nApplicant has $28,000 of delinquent debt, has no plans to repay it, and has not sought\nhelp. I empathize with her difficulty raising two children on one income. However, she\nmust, at minimum, demonstrate an effort to organize her finances and develop a\npayment plan. Instead, she has merely reiterated throughout the investigative process\nher inability to pay her delinquencies. Applicant has not mitigated the Financial\nConsiderations concern related to her eligibility to occupy an ADP position. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies exceed her annual salary. Any mitigation generated by\nher difficulty in making ends meet is outweighed by her failure to seek financial\ncounseling and to organize her finances. Upon considering this case in the context of\nthe Whole Person concept, I conclude that her eligibility to occupy an ADP position\nmust be denied.\n\n4\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.i\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility to occupy an\nADP position. Eligibility to occupy a position of public trust is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on \nMay 4, 2009 (Item 3).  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 21, 2009. He admitted four and \ndenied four of the eight allegations under Guideline F. He noted that four of the debts \nhad been settled and paid and he was saving funds to pay the remaining four debts. He \nelected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). \nDepartment counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on June 23, 2009. \n1 \n \nOctober 20, 2009\n\n2 \n \nApplicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on July 1, 2009, and was \nprovided the opportunity to file objections, and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the disqualifying conditions. Applicant has not provided additional information in \nresponse to the FORM within the 30 day time limit. The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 8, 2009. Based on a review of the case file and pleadings, eligibility for access \nto sensitive information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, to \n1.c, and 1.h. He denied the debts at SOR \u00b6 1.d to 1.g, and provided documentation that \nthe debts had been settled and paid (Item 4, Response to SOR, dated May 21, 2009). \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old and has been a computer systems operator for a \ndefense contractor for over three years. He attends college as a part-time student \nworking towards a degree in computer information systems. He is married with no \nchildren (Item 5). His net monthly income is $3,849.70, with monthly expenses of \n$2,878.24. He has a monthly remainder of $366.54 (Item 6, at 6). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR (Item 2), his answers to interrogatories (Item 5), \nand credit reports (Items 7, 8, 9) establish that Applicant has delinquent debts, totaling \napproximately $15,175. The documents support a debt in collection for a bank credit \ncard of $5,326 (SOR 1.a); a credit card debt in collection for a savings and loan of \n$5,035 (SOR 1.b); a store account in collection for $1,951 (SOR 1.c); a medical debt for \n$111 (SOR 1.d); a telephone bill in collection for $207 (SOR 1.e); a medical account for \n$308 (SOR 1.f); another medical account for $85 (SOR 1.g); and another medical \naccount for $2,152 (SOR 1.h). The accounts became delinquent between 2005 and \n2008. Applicant presented no information concerning the reasons he has delinquent \ndebts. He acknowledged he accumulated debts but noted he is attempting to fulfill his \nfinancial obligations. \n \n \nIn answer to the SOR, Applicant noted that the delinquent debts in SOR 1. d to \n1.g were settled and paid. He provided documentation to verify the agreed settlement \nand payment of the debts in the February and March 2009 timeframe (Item 4 with \nattachments). Applicant also acknowledged that he owes the debts at SOR 1. a, 1. b,   \n1. c, and 1.g. He noted he is saving to pay these debts. There is no documentation to \nestablish any payments made on these debts (See, Item 4, and Response to FORM).  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \n\n3 \n \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThere is a security concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect sensitive \n\n4 \n \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts from credit cards and medical debts, as \nestablished by credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions, are a security concern raising \nFinancial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). Applicant has significant delinquent debts that he has not resolved.   \n \n \nI have considered a number of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \n(FC MC). FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nWhile the debts may have been incurred in the past, some are still unpaid and thus \ncurrent. There are a number of different accounts and debts, so the debts were not \nincurred infrequently. Applicant has not established that the delinquent debts will not \nrecur. His continued debts and financial situation cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separations) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances); and FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the person \nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). Applicant has not \npresented any information to establish circumstances beyond his control that caused his \ndelinquent debts. He has not presented any information to indicate he has received or is \nreceiving financial counseling. He still has four significant debts that he has not taken \nany action to settle or resolve. His financial problems are not under control.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Applicant presented \ndocumentation that four of his delinquent debts have been settled and paid. However, \nthese are the smallest of his delinquent debts and the total settled and paid is only \n$711. This still leaves Applicant with $14,464 in delinquent debts. For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded. Good-faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \n\n5 \n \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not \nmitigated by payment of debt only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. \nApplicant presented information to show he paid four of the eight delinquent debts. \nApplicant did not present a concrete plan as to how he was to pay his remaining \ndelinquent debts. His only statement was that he was currently working to obtain money \nto settle the remaining debts. He did not provide information about how he was trying to \nraise funds to pay the debts. A promise to pay debts in the future is not evidence of a \ngood-faith intention to resolve debts. Applicant did not present sufficient information to \nestablish a good-faith effort to pay creditors or resolve debts. His finances are not under \ncontrol and he has not acted responsibly towards his finances. He has not mitigated \nsecurity concerns for financial considerations. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not presented \ninformation to show he has taken sufficient action to resolve his financial issues. \nApplicant must establish that he has a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, \nincluding evidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. He is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he paid off each and every debt listed in \nthe SOR. All that is required is that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems and \ntakes significant action to implement that plan. The entirety of his financial situation and \nhis actions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which his plan to \nreduce his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable \ninformation about the person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.  \n \nApplicant has not established a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment by \npresenting information to show he is taking sufficient, consistent, reasonable, and \n\n6 \n \nresponsible action to resolve his financial issues. He did settle and resolve the four \nsmallest of his delinquent debts. But this is only a small part of his delinquent debts. He \ndid not present any plans on how he intends to resolve and pay his remaining \ndelinquent debts. Applicant has not demonstrated that he is managing his finances \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He has not presented a consistent record of \nactions to resolve financial issues. He has not established that he has taken and will \ntake reasonable steps to address his remaining delinquent debts and resolve his \nfinancial problems.  The record shows that he has been irresponsible towards his \nfinancial obligations. The lack of responsible management of present finances and past \nobligations indicates he will not be concerned or responsible, but will be careless, in \nregard to sensitive information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He has not \nestablished that he is suitable for access to sensitive information. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Appellant has not mitigated the public trust concerns arising from his \nfinancial situation. Access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.
