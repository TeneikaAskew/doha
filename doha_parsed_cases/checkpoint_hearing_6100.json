He has shown\npayment of $327.  The record evidence is insufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security\nimplications stemming from Applicant\u2019s unpaid debts. Clearance is denied.\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\n1\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\n1\nclearance for Applicant, due to Financial Considerations security concerns. On May 4, 2007,\nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing. On July 16, 2007, I was\nassigned the case. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concern for Financial Considerations. Applicant admits owing the\nIRS $4,542 and alleges he has entered into a repayment plan whereby he pays $250 per month.  He\nadmits owing six other debts and alleges he has entered into a repayment arrangement.  He asserts\nhe is making payments on department store account. Applicant asserts the debt of $4,511 listed in\nSOR 1.d and the $4,511 debt listed in SOR 1.f. are the same debt. The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of\nfact.\nApplicant is a 61-year-old designer who has worked for a defense contractor since January\n2004, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant is regarded by his supervisor, co-\nworkers, and those who know him as responsible, works well with others, has a warm and bright\npersonality, and is a very valued employee. He sets examples for others to follow. He was\ncongratulated on the team effort to complete a phase of work. (Applicant\u2019s response to FORM)\nApplicant owed the IRS $4,552 for delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2000 and 2002.\n(SOR 1.a)  As of February 2007, Applicant owed $4,542. From the IRS statement (Item 5) it is\nunclear if the $2,811reported as penalties and interest is in addition to or included in the current\nbalance listed at $4,542.\nIn January 2007, Applicant completed interrogatories about his debts. (Item 5) Applicant\nowed $1,386 on a charged off credit card account (SOR 1.b), $671 on a charged off department store\naccount (SOR 1.c), $4,511 on a charged off store account (SOR 1.d), $824 on a charged off store\naccount (SOR 1. e), $4,511 to a collection agency (SOR 1.f), $663 on a charged off department store\naccount (SOR 1. g), and $1,421 on a charged off credit card account (SOR 1.h).  As of mid- May\n2007, the $663 department store charged off account had been reduced to $336, after he made a\n$100 payment on the account in early May 2007. \nIn February 2007, Applicant completed a monthly financial statement which showed his net\nremainder was a negative $229 per month. (Item 5)  As of February 2007, Applicant's gross pay,\nwith over time, was $3,199 per two weeks and his net pay was $1,919. (Item 5) \nIn January 2007, Applicant contacted a law firm to resolve his financial problems. (Item 3)\nThe agreement required Applicant to pay the law firm $515 each month.  The law firm sent letters\n\n3\nto ten collection agencies stating the Applicant was disputing the debt and requested verification of\nthe debt. (Item 5)  Applicant's March 2007-credit report (Item 6) lists two account numbers for SOR\ndebts listed as SOR 1.b and SOR 1.d, which have similar account numbers to the accounts on two\nof the letters sent by the law firm. \nThere is no evidence showing which debts are included in the repayment agreement.  There\nis no evidence Applicant has made any payments to the law firm.  There is no evidence the law firm\nhas ever made payment to a creditor. The lack of payment documentation was set forth in the\nFORM.  Applicant failed to show any documented payment in his response to the FORM. \nFrom May 1983 until February 2002, Applicant was a senior analyst for a power and light\ncompany. (Item 4) Applicant asserts his financial troubles began when he was placed in early\nretirement at age 55 and attempted a small business venture, a convenience store.  The store operated\nfrom August 2002 until July 2003. (Item 4) A highway bypass caused a reduction in patrons and\nApplicant sold the store for \u201cwhat I had invested and broke about even at that point.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to FORM)  Applicant was unemployed from July 2003 to January 2004.  He obtained his\ncurrent job in January 2004. \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F, Financial Considerations.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n4\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his\nfinances so as to meet his financial obligations.\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nThe Applicant admits owing seven delinquent debts totaling $13,691. Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) 19 a, \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and 19 c, \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d apply. \nIn January 2007, Applicant was asked about his past due debts. Since that time, he has\ndocumented payment showing he reduced one department store debt (SOR 1.g) from $663 to $336.\nThere is no evidence of any additional payments.  Applicant asserts the $4,511 debt listed in SOR\n1.d is the same $4,511 debt listed in SOR 1.f, and I find these to be the same debt. \nApplicant entered into an agreement with a law firm whereby he was to pay $515 each\nmonth.  There is no evidence he has made any payments in compliance with the agreement.  The\nFORM pointed out a lack of documented payment in compliance with the agreement.  Applicant\u2019s\nanswer to the FORM failed to provide any payment documentation. Entering into an initial\nagreement establishes nothing.  Applicants often make one, two, or three payments before they stop\nsending money in compliance with the repayment agreement. Frequently, no payments are ever\n\n5\nmade after an applicant initially talks with the financial consulting firm. There is no evidence of\npayment.\nThe law firm sent letters to ten creditors stating the Applicant disputed the debts and asking\nfor verification of the debts. This is immaterial since Applicant admitted he owes all of the debts.\nMitigating Condition (MC) 20 e, \u201dthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d does not apply.  There\nis no showing which debts were included in the repayment agreement.  Debts are often transferred\nfrom one collection agency to another.  In viewing Applicant\u2019s March 2007-credit report (Item 6)\nand the account numbers listed in the law firm\u2019s letters to the creditors only two account numbers\n(SOR 1.b and SOR 1.d) are similar. \nThe burden is on Applicant to show which debts are in the repayment agreement.  This he\nhas failed to do.  For Mitigating Condition (MC) 20 d, \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d to apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay\nthe debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete\nmethod of handling his debts is needed, which is not present here. Applicant\u2019s February 2007\nmonthly financial statement (item 5) shows a negative net monthly remainder of $229.  He does not\nhave the ability to repay.  There is no showing of any payment to a creditor in compliance with a\nrepayment schedule.  Applicant asserts he is paying the IRS $250 per month, but has failed to\ndocument payment.  MC 20 d does not apply.\nNone of the other mitigating conditions apply. Since the debts are yet owed, the behavior is\nrecent, there are seven debts so the behavior is not infrequent, and did not occur under circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur. MC 20 a, \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant was the owner of a convenience store which he operated for about a year.  He sold\nit and broke even.  He was unemployed for six months from July 2003 until January 2004. These\nare factors beyond his control. But he has been employed for three and a half years and the only\ndocumented payment is the $327 made on a department store account. I find MC 20 b, \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d does not excuse\nApplicant\u2019s lack of payment.\nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling or that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control.  Seeking the assistance of a law firm to resolve his debts is not the same\nas receiving counseling. MC 20 c, \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d does\nnot apply.  Affluence was not at issue, therefore MC 20 f, \u201cthe affluence resulted from a legal source\nof income\u201d does not apply. \nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\n\n6\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future. \nApplicant asserts he is addressing his past due debts.  He has shown payment of only $327\non his delinquent debts. A clearance at this time is not warranted. This decision should not be\nconstrued as a determination that Applicant can not or will not attain the state of reform and\nrehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security clearance. The awarding of a security\nclearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both\ndisqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Should the Applicant be afforded an\nopportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, having paid his debts or established\ncompliance with a repayment plan, he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security\nworthiness.  However, because the disqualifying conditions apply and no mitigating conditions\napply, I find against Applicant as to Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nSame debt as 1.d. \nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_____________________________\nClaude R.

He was born in Taiwan,\nand came to the United States in 1981 to further his education.  He and his wife became United\nStates citizens in 1992, and they have two sons who are United States citizens.  He owns property\nin the United States but not in Taiwan.  His parents, five siblings, parents-in-law, and brothers-in-law\nare citizens and residents of Taiwan.  He has a childhood friend that he sees on his visits to Taiwan.\nHe has established that his relatives and friend in Taiwan are not in a position to cause him to be\nvulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  The new\nadjudicative guidelines (AG), promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nin the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006, will be used to adjudicate this case.  Applicant\nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 9, 2007.  The SOR alleges security concerns under\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 16, 2007.  He admitted all of the allegations\nunder Guideline B with detailed explanations.  He requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge, and the request was received by DOHA on April 17, 2007.  Department Counsel was prepared\nto proceed with the case on May 9, 2007, and the case was assigned to another Administrative Judge\non May 14, 2007.  The case was reassigned to another Administrative Judge on June 12, 2007, and\nreassigned to me on August 3, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 28, 2007, for a hearing\non August 15, 2007.  Applicant was unavailable for a hearing from July 10 to August 3, 2007.  The\nhearing was convened as scheduled on August 15, 2007.  Four government exhibits, marked\nGovernment Exhibits 1-4, were admitted without objection.  Six Applicant exhibits, marked\nApplicant Exhibits A-F, were admitted without objection.  The testimony of the Applicant and two\nApplicant witnesses were received during the hearing.  The transcript (Tr.) was received by DOHA\non August 28, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nApplicant moved to supplement and amend his answer to the SOR .  Applicant\u2019s\n1\nsupplemental answer does not make any substantial changes to the original answer to the SOR, but\nincludes additional details and fact for the whole person analysis.  Department Counsel did not\nobject to consideration of the Supplemental Answer to the SOR except for any portion of the\n\nTr. 9-14.\n2\nCourt Exhibit I.\n3\nCourt Exhibits II-XI.\n4\nCourt Exhibit XII.\n5\nCourt Exhibit XIII and XXV.\n6\nTr. 15-46.\n7\nTr. 118-119.\n8\nTr. 120-128.\n9\n3\nsupplemental information that is considered argument rather than facts.  The motion to supplement\nand amend the answer to the SOR is granted, and is admitted.2\nDepartment Counsel and Applicant requested that administrative notice be taken of facts\npertaining to Taiwan.   Department Counsel presented ten documents to support the facts requested\n3\nto be accepted for administrative notice.   Applicant requested different or additional facts to be\n4\nconsidered by administrative notice,  and presented 13 documents in support of the request.\n5\n6\nAdministrative notice was taken of material and relevant facts concerning Taiwan as noted in the\nFindings of Facts section of this decision.7\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of the allegations under Guideline B.  After a thorough review of the\npleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old computer software engineer.  He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in\neconomics from a university in Taiwan, and a master\u2019s degree in computer engineering from a\nuniversity in the United States.  He completed the course work for a doctorate in computer\nengineering from an United States university, but has not completed his dissertation.  He is married\nwith two sons.  His wife was born in Taiwan but is a United States citizen.  His two sons were born\nin the United States and are United States citizens.8\nApplicant was born in Taiwan in 1955.  He attended schools in Taiwan ending with the\naward of a bachelor\u2019s degree.  He took the competitive examination and started working for a\ncommercial bank in Taiwan in 1977.  He worked at the bank until 1981, when he emigrated to the\nUnited States to pursue graduate work in computer software engineering.  He received a master\u2019s\ndegree from a United States university and started working for companies in the United States.\nApplicant became a United States citizen in 1992.  After receiving his master\u2019s degree, he worked\nfor various companies in the computer programming field, leaving each for better positions and\nadvancement in other companies.  In 2002, he commenced working for a defense contractor in\npositions not requiring a security clearance.   He submitted his security clearance application in\n9\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigative Processing, (E-QIP), dated October 26,\n10\n2005).\nTr. 109-114; 175-17; Government Exhibit 2 (Response to Interrogatories, dated February 22, 2007), at 6-28.\n11\nThis exhibit included a copy of the Taiwan passport and the FSO\u2019s statement of destruction.  See, Applicant Exhibit F\n(Applicant\u2019s Resume, undated).\nTr. 127-136.\n12\nTr. 159-169.\n13\n4\n2005.10\nApplicant had a Taiwanese passport when he emigrated to the United States.  He renewed\nhis Taiwanese passport in 1996, after becoming a United States citizen.  He went to a Taiwan interest\noffice in the United States for a visa to enter Taiwan for a periodic visit.  The Taiwan officials asked\nto see his Taiwanese passport to be able to spell his Chinese name using Chinese characters.\nBecause the passport was about to expire, the official asked Applicant if he wished to renew the\npassport.  Applicant renewed the passport.  He never used it and it expired in 2002.  He turned this\npassport over to his facilities security officer (FSO) who destroyed it.  The only passport he has, and\nthe only passport he has used since he became a United States citizen, is his United States passport.\nApplicant believes he is a dual citizen of both Taiwan and the United States because of Taiwan\u2019s\ncitizenship laws.  He is willing to take the necessary steps to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship.\nHe requested instructions to do so but has not taken any steps to renounce the citizenship.  He never\nvoted in Taiwan or performed or undertaken any other citizenship activity. He did the two-year\ncompulsory military service required of all healthy Taiwanese men.  Applicant has no business or\nfinancial interests in Taiwan.  All of his financial, property, and business interests are in the United\nStates.   \n11\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  Applicant\u2019s father is an 80-year-old\nretired civil engineer for the local town, and in poor health.  He is partially paralyzed from a stroke,\nis totally unable to care for himself, and must relying on a live-in care giver to provide the essentials\nof daily living.  His mother has always been a housewife working at home.  His parents stay at home,\nand his mother assists with his father\u2019s care.  His father received a lump sum pension payment when\nhe retired.  As is the practice in Taiwan, the lump sum payment went to a bank and draws a high\ninterest.  His parents are able to live within the interest resources except for the funding required for\nhis father\u2019s medical care.  His father receives no other payments from the government.  Applicant\nand his other siblings assist his parents in paying the live-in health care provider.  Applicant\u2019s sends\nhis parents about $4,500 annually to help defray the cost.  When his father dies and no longer needs\nthe health care, Applicant will not be required to send money to his parents.   He feels a sense of\n12\nfilial piety or sacred duty to assist with the care of his parents.  Since he is not the oldest son, he does\nnot have primary responsibility for their care but he does have a duty to assist with their care.  He\ndoes not discuss his work with his parents.  They only know he is involved in computer work.  \n13\nApplicant has two older and two younger brothers and a younger sister who are citizens and\nresidents of Taiwan.  One of his younger brothers received a masters degree in architecture from a\nUnited States university and returned to Taiwan to open his own architecture firm.  His other\nyounger brother has visited the United States on a tour.  All of his other siblings have never been to\n\nTr. 136-142, 169-178.\n14\nTr. 168-171.\n15\nTr. 143-146, 163-165.\n16\nRe, 83-89; Applicant Exhibit D (Taiwan Passport, dated June 12, 1996, expired June 19, 2002).\n17\n5\nthe United States.  They have no plans to move to the United States.  His oldest brother works in\nconstruction as a civil engineer for a private company doing school construction.  His second oldest\nbrother is a retired teacher, who receives some form of pension from the government.  His youngest\nbrother runs an architectural firm, and his other younger brother works for him as his office manager.\nHis sister is an administrative assistant for a business.  None of his relatives work for the Taiwan\ngovernment.   Most of Appellant\u2019s contacts with his siblings are with his second oldest brother, the\n14\nretired teacher.  He talks to him about every two or three months discussing family matters and his\nsons and their education.  His only other sibling communication is basically when he visits Taiwan.\nHe usually visits his family in Taiwan every two or three years.  Sometimes it is more frequent\ndepending on the health of his parents.  He goes with his family but sometimes he has to go by\nhimself.  His last visit to Taiwan was three weeks during the summer of 2007.  His entire family,\nwife and sons, visited his parents, his siblings, and his wife\u2019s family.  He does not discuss his work\nwith his siblings, even the retired teacher that he communicates with the most.   He has never been\n15\napproached by any individual, family member, friend, or official on his trips to Taiwan to discuss\nhis work.  He has never been asked to provide any information on any projects he has or was\nworking.  No one has ever requested information from him about his work.\nApplicant contacts and sees a childhood friend when he visits Taiwan.  The friend is the lead\naccountant for a department of the central bank of Taiwan.  He communicates with his friend by\ntelephone only occasionally becasue they are both busy with their families and work.  He does\ncommunicate with the friend by e-mail for special occasions like birthdays.  He contacts the friend\nand other school acquaintances when he visits Taiwan, and they meet for dinner.  They talk about\ncurrent Taiwan events and their families.  They do not talk about his job or occupation, except telling\nthem he is in computers.  He does not feel any loyalty or obligation to his friend.  However, he feels\nthe relationship is more than a casual because they have maintained a long friendship.16\nApplicant met his wife when they were in college in Taiwan and they were married in 1984.\nShe followed her husband to the United States in January 1985 to further her education.  She became\na United States citizen in 1992, and resides with Applicant and her family in the United States.  Her\nTaiwan passport was renewed in 1996 after she became a United States citizen, but has expired and\nis not current.  She does not remember why she applied for and received the new Taiwan passport.\nShe never used her Taiwan passport since becoming a United States citizen.  She only has a current\nUnited States passport.  She has never voted in Taiwan or performed any other citizenship activity\nin Taiwan.  However, she believes she is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States.  She has\nnot taken any steps to renounce her Taiwan citizenship.  She is also a computer program engineer\nworking as a business systems analyst for a major United States internet service provider.  She held\na security clearance for two years while working on a classified project for a defense contractor.  She\ndoes not work on classified projects in her present position.17\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents and two brothers are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Her parents\n\nTr. 90-103.\n18\nTr. 140-143.\n19\nTr. 60-80.\n20\nApplicant Exhibit C (Letter, dated August 8, 2007).\n21\n6\nowned a small shop but are retired.  Her brothers now run the shop.  None of her relatives worked\nfor the Taiwan government.  She talks to her mother a few times a month by telephone.  She will\noccasionally talk to her father if he is available when she calls.  Applicant rarely talks to her family\nexcept on holidays or as a courtesy.  She mainly talks about her parents\u2019 health and her children.\nThey never discuss Applicant\u2019s work.  She does not send money to her family except at New Year\u2019s\nas part of custom and tradition.  She does not own any property in Taiwan or expect to inherit\nanything from her parents.  Since becoming a United States citizen, she usually travels to Taiwan\nabout every three years to visit family and friends.  Since coming to the United States, she has\nreturned to Taiwan about four or five times.  Her last trip was in the summer of 2007.  She and\nApplicant usually visit her family a few times when they are in Taiwan.  They always stay with his\nfamily and not with her family.   Applicant knows of no reasons for them to be subject to\n18\nexploitation.  His only obligation to them is to care for their daughter, his wife.  As a son-in-law, he\nhas no obligation to care for them.  He never communicates with his brothers-in-law and only sees\nthem when he visits his wife\u2019s family.  They never discuss his work.19\nApplicant is well regarded at work by his supervisors and co-workers.  A group leader for\nApplicant\u2019s employer testified that he has known Applicant for over two years.  He does not have\ndirect supervision over Applicant, but does supervise Applicant on some of his work projects.  He\nsees Applicant frequently, a few hours a week.  He travels with him to present material to\ngovernment clients.  As a project lead, he does provide performance information on Applicant to\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor.  His reports on Applicant are always very positive.  The clients are also very\npositive about Applicant\u2019s work.  He has never observed Applicant doing anything that would raise\nany security concerns.20\nApplicant presented a letter of recommendation from his employer\u2019s associate department\nhead.  The individual has known Applicant for over two years, and is responsible for monitoring his\nperformance and development.  Applicant is a dedicated, honest, and responsible individual.  He is\nprofessional and highly ethical.  He is convinced Applicant will clearly have the interest of national\nsecurity if granted access to classified information.21\nDuring World War II and after, a civil war was fought on the mainland of China between the\nChinese Communist Party and the Nationalist Chinese.  In 1949, the Chinese Communis Party was\nvictorious and established a government on the mainland.  The Nationalist Chinese fled to Taiwan\nand established a government.  Taiwan has developed steadily since then and is now the world\u2019s 17th\nlargest economy.  Taiwan became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2002, further\nexpanding its trade opportunities and further strengthening its standing in the global economy.  This\nprosperity established economic and social stability.  \nUntil 1986, Taiwan's political system was effectively controlled by one party, the\nKuomintang.  Since ending martial law in 1987, Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve respect\n\nSee, United States,. Department of State's Background Note: Taiwan, dated April 2007.\n22\nSee, Congressional Research Service Report to Congress: Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy\n23\nChoices, dated October 9, 2006.\nSee, Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage.  While the report\n24\nis undated, the government\u2019s request for administrative notice refers to the document as a 2000 report.  There are a\nnumber of examples in this report of espionage on U.S. economic and industrial activities by Taiwanese officials or\ncompanies. Also of note is a Private Industry Survey by officials of the National Counterintelligence Center listing\nTaiwan as one of the most active collectors of economic and industrial espionage. The list of most active collectors was\ndeveloped by contacting nearly a dozen selected Fortune 500 companies for their view of the problem of foreign\neconomic collection and industrial espionage. Only a small sampling, 12 of 500, of companies were contacted. The\ncompanies and individuals contacted are not identified.  The report was given minimal weight.\nSee, United States State Department Background Notes, Taiwan, dated April 2007; United States Department\n25\nof State, Country Report on Human Rights Practices-2006, China (Taiwan Only) dated March 6, 2007).\nPublic Law 96-8.\n26\n7\nfor human rights and create a democratic political system. The United States has been committed\nto maintaining cultural, commercial, and other nonofficial relations with Taiwan since January 1979,\nwhen it formally recognized the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the sole\nlegal government of China. By formal act of Congress (Taiwan Relations Act of 1979), the United\nStates is committed to provide Taiwan with military defensive arms in support of Taiwan's security\nand stability in the region.  The United States also stated it would maintain cultural, commercial, and\nother unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.  Despite the United States clear and consistent\nposition that Taiwan and the mainland are part of one China, United States commercial ties have\nexpanded with Taiwan and the United States is supportive of Taiwan's membership in international\norganizations, such as the World Trade Organization and the Asian Development Bank.   While still\n22\npursuing a closer relationship with Taiwan, the official United States position on Taiwan and\nmainland China seems to be a criticism of mainland China\u2019s buildup opposite Taiwan with periodic\ncautions and warnings to the effect that United States support for Taiwan is not unconditional, but\nhas limits.  Smooth United States and PRC relations are an important tool in cooperating against\nterrorism and maintaining stability in Pacific region.  Faced with competing pressures and the\ncontinuing transformation on both the PRC and Taiwan systems, the United States government may\nbe facing new and more difficult policy choices concerning Taiwan in the next few years.23\nThe parties disagree on the character of Taiwan. The government claims Taiwan poses a\nthreat to national security because, in the past, it was one of the countries most actively engaged in\nindustrial espionage and the collection of foreign economic information.   It presented information\n24\nconcerning individual\u2019s in the United States convicted of engaging in espionage practices with\nTaiwan companies or officials.  It also notes Taiwan\u2019s proximity to mainland China and the national\nsecurity threat from PRC.  On the other hand, Applicant established that Taiwan has a democratic\npolitical system, has made dramatic steps toward improving its respect for human rights, has ended\nrestrictions on freedom of the press and the formation of new political parties, and has relaxed\nrestrictions on personal freedoms.   The relationship between the United States and Taiwan is\n25\ndefined in the Taiwan Relations Act which was a recognition of Taiwan by the United States.26\nTaiwan has a long history of friendly relations with the United States, including substantial levels\nof foreign trade. The claims of the parties are not irreconcilable. Taiwan can still be an ally and\nfriend but pose a security threat because of efforts to obtain national security information.\n\nSee, Consular Information Sheet-China, dated March 19, 2007; United States Department of State, Country\n27\nReport on Human Rights Practices-2006: China (including Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau), dated March 6, 2007.\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n28\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n29\nAG 2(a).\n30\n8\nThe government contends that the PRC must be considered when discussing security threats\nfrom Taiwan because of its proximity to Taiwan.  It is noted that China is hostile to the United States\nand has interests inimical to those of the U.S.  China is ruled by a totalitarian government that\ndepends on the suppression of its people for continuation in power. The PRC government has a poor\nrecord of human rights that features, among other things, repression of political and religious\ndissenters.  China is known to engage in espionage against the United States, both economically,\nmilitarily, and technically.  Chinese security personnel place foreign visitors under surveillance and\nsubject them to search without their knowledge or consent.  \n27\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n28\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.29\nThe Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.\nEnclosure 2, amended by the new Administrative Guidelines, of the Directive sets forth the standards\nfor determining eligibility for access to classified information, listing the disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions to be considered for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be fair,\nimpartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances,\nthe whole person concept.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of\nrecurrence.30\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.

It is merely\n31\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.32\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n33\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n34\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n35\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n36\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d 37\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nUnder Guideline B, foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in United States interest, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United State citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associate with a risk of terrorism.\nApplicant admits his parents and siblings are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  He admits he\nhas a close friend since childhood who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan.  He admits his parents-in-\nlaw and two brothers-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  Appellant\u2019s admitted relatives and\nfriends who are citizens and residents of Taiwan raise Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI\n\n10\nDC) \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion).  Each individual contact by\nitself may not create a heightened risk of foreign influence, but the totality of the contacts does indicate\nthere may be a heightened risk of foreign influence.\nIn determining if Applicant\u2019s family and friend in Taiwan cause security concerns, I considered\nthat Taiwan is an ally of the United States, has a defense agreement with the United States, and is one\nof the United States\u2019 substantial trading partners.  I considered that Taiwan improved its human rights\nposition and its people enjoy basic freedoms.  While the United States has a one-China policy, the\nUnited States does maintain cultural, commercial, and other ties with Taiwan.  I considered that\nTaiwan does engage in economic and other types of espionage, and there are instances of Taiwan\nofficials and companies engaging in such espionage with individuals in the United States.  There are\nno indications that in these instances Taiwan was targeting United States citizens to provide economic\nor other sensitive information.  I also considered that faced with new and competing national interest,\nthe United States policy toward Taiwan could change.  While Taiwan is a country that is friendly to\nthe United Stares, even as a friendly country, it could engage in espionage against United States\ninterests.  Friendly countries may have profound disagreements with the United States or have engaged\nin espionage against United States economic, scientific, or technical interest.  A friendly relationship\nis not determinative, but it makes it less likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a\nUnited States citizen through relatives or associates in that country.  Taiwan is not a hostile country,\nnor are its interests inimical to the United States.  The United States and Taiwan are large democracies,\nenjoy good relations, and are trading partners.  It is reasonable to considered that Taiwan would not\ntake any action to jeopardize their friendly position with the United States because of their need for\ntrade and defense assistance from the United States.  It would be consider an act unfriendly to the\ninterest of the United States to coerce its citizens with relatives in the United States to pressure their\nUnited States relatives to provide economic or other espionage information against the interest of the\nUnited States.  While none of the considerations by themselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors\nto be considered in determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion from his family\nmembers in Taiwan.\nI considered the proximity of PRC to Taiwan and that the PRC is very actively engaged in\neconomic and other espionage against the United States.  I considered that PRC\u2019s interests are against\nUnited States interests.  However, I also note that none of Applicant\u2019s relatives are in PRC and there\nis no connection of his family with PRC.  So, the consideration of PRC is not a significant factor in\nconsidering Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion.\nWhile Applicant and his wife share living quarters, his wife is a United States citizen residing\nin the United States, and does not create by herself a security concern for Applicant.  The security\nconcern raised by Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family are a direct security concern for Applicant, so FI DC \u00b6 7(d)\n(sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) need not be\nconsidered as a separate disqualifying condition.\nDepartment counsel argues that FI DC \u00b6 7(h) (indications that representatives or nationals from\na foreign country are acting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion) is raised by the information presented.\n\n11\nThe only information presented concerned general indications of past actions of Taiwanese officials\nengaging in espionage activities.  The disqualifying condition specifically pertains to indication that\nrepresentatives of the country are increasing the vulnerability of the individual (Applicant) for possible\nfuture exploitation.  There are no indications of any targeting of Applicant for future exploitation.  The\ndisqualifying condition has not been raised.\nApplicant has raised Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the\nrelationship with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or\nactivities of those persons in that country are such that is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interest of the United States).  Applicant presented information that his father is\na retired civil engineer from a local government.  He received a lump-sum payment as a pension and\nuses the interest for living expenses.  As such, he is not dependent on any government entity for his\npension.  His father is also very ill requiring continuous medical care.  His mother was a housewife\nwho appears to be healthy, and the interest from the father\u2019s retirement fund will sustain her in her\nremaining years.  Applicant\u2019s siblings are professional working for private businesses in Taiwan.  They\nare engineers, architects, retired teachers, and office managers.  His wife\u2019s parents are retired shop\nkeepers.  His brothers-in-law have taken over their parents\u2019 shop.  His friend works for the central\nbank in Taiwan but he is not a high officer or official in the bank.  He is a lead accountant for one of\nthe department within the bank.  He sees the friend for dinner on his trips to Taiwan.  Applicant\u2019s\ninformation concerning his family members\u2019 living conditions, life style, and professions, and the\nnature and extent of his relationship with his friend show it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a\nposition to choose between the interests of his family and friend and the interests of the United States.\nApplicant has established that his family and friend in Taiwan do not present a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  They are ordinary citizens\nleading normal lives which also does not indicating a heightened risk of exploitation, pressure, or\ncoercion.  The positions and activities of his family and friend and the fact they are in Taiwan show\nthat it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of being coerced or pressured to choose\nbetween these people and his interests in protecting the national security of the United States.  FI MC\n\u00b6 8(a) applies.\nApplicant has raised FI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest).\nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to duress is also important.  Applicant and his wife have been in the United\nStates for over 23 years, and have been citizens of the United States for over 15 years.  They have two\nsons, born and educated in the United States and are citizens of the United States.  Applicant and his\nwife have substantial financial interest in the United States and have no financial interest in Taiwan.\nThe couple are gainfully employed by businesses in the United States.  The wife at one time was\ngranted a security clearance when performing defense contracting work.  Applicant is considered a\nhighly valuable employee.  While Applicant and his family have made numerous and repeated trips\nto Taiwan, they were solely for the purpose of visiting family.  Applicant has demonstrated that he is\nnot unusually vulnerable to duress. Applicant has a sense of loyalty or obligation to his family and\nfriend in Taiwan.  But he also has long standing relationship and connections in the United States.  He\nhas demonstrated that these relationships will lead him to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe United States.  FI MC \u00b6 8(b) applies.\n\nAG \u00b6 2 (8).\n38\nAG \u00b6 2 (4).\n39\n12\nApplicant has raised  FI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual\nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation).  The vulnerability to duress of Applicant\u2019s relatives and friend in Taiwan is important.\nApplicant has the burden of presenting information to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security\nconcerns raised by the government.  Applicant\u2019s contacts with his relatives and friend in Taiwan are\nnot casual.  Applicant is in contact with his mother every few months.  His father is ill so his contacts\nwith him are minimal.  He has minimal contacts with his siblings, except for a brother who he talks\nto every few months.  He rarely talks to his friend, but occasionally exchanges e-mails and sees him\non every visit to Taiwan.  He does not consider his friendship as casual since it has continued since\nchildhood.  He rarely if ever talks to his in-laws, but his wife talks to her mother a few times a month.\nWhile these contacts are infrequent, they are with  family members and a friend, so they are not casual.\nThey are maintained because the relationships are deeply held.  When considering the contacts either\nindividually or collectively, they are not casual.  Accordingly, FI MC 8(c) does not apply. \nAs noted above, FI DC 7(h) has not been raised.  However, if it was raised, Applicant has\npresented information to refute and mitigate the security concern.  Applicant has never been\napproached or questioned about is work by any family member, friend, or Taiwan official.  When in\nTaiwan, no one asked about his employer or his work projects.  No one has indicated to him that his\nfamily or friends are under pressure or duress by the Taiwan government because of him.  He has\nshown that there are no indications that representative or individuals in Taiwan are acting to increase\nhis vulnerability to exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. \nI carefully considered all of the circumstances discussed above in regard to disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions as well as the following factors in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept requires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a\nsingle item in isolation, to reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness.  Applicant\u2019s family and friends in Taiwan both individually and collectively are in\npositions and circumstances that make it unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position to choose\nbetween the interests of  his family and friend and the interest of the United States, or can be exploited,\npressured, or coerced because of them.   Applicant has been in the United States for over 23 years and\n38\na citizen of the United States for over 15 years.   His wife and sons are with him in the United States\n39\nand they are United States citizens.  He has accumulated significant assets in the United States.  His\nco-worker and his supervisor consider him to be security conscious.  He does not discuss his work with\nhis family, friends, or in-laws in Taiwan.  He does travel to Taiwan periodically for the purpose of\nvisiting family.  Applicant and his wife have no property or income in Taiwan.  Their assets are solely\nin the United States.  Applicant\u2019s life story is an example of the success of many immigrants to the\nUnited States.  He came to the United States early in his life to better himself through education.  He\nremained here and has been a citizen for over 15 years.  His wife came to the United States for the\nsame reason and is a successful professional.  Their children were born in the United States and are\ncitizens.  The family enjoys a typical United States life style with small vestiges of their Chinese\nculture.  Applicant is a trusted employee.  As a good son, he takes care of his parents and visits them\nperiodically.  All of his visits to Taiwan were for family purposes rather than any connection to the\n\nAG \u00b6 2 (7).\n40\n13\nTaiwanese government.   He has established that his motivation for his contacts and activities with\n40\nhis family and friend in Taiwan do not indicate a security risk.  He has presented sufficient information\nto mitigate any security concerns under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.

Watson, Personal Representative \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 1,\n2006. On June 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines J and H\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 11, 2007. He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 24, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 13, 2007. I received\nthe case assignment on October 4, 2007, after it was transferred from another judge\nwho had received it on August 21, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November\n7, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 29, 2007. The\nFebruary 15, 2008\n\n2\ngovernment offered three exhibits (Exh.) which were received without objection.\nApplicant and three witnesses testified on his behalf. He submitted 23 exhibits (Exh.\nA-MM) which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on December 7, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, testimony, and the applicable statutory provision relating to an applicant\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend Answer to SOR\nAt the hearing it became apparent that Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was\nconfusing and inconsistent with the pleadings. His answers lettered K-S were repetitive\nof answers B-J and two paragraphs were transposed in answers C and D. Applicant\nmoved  to amend the answer to which the government agreed. The amended answer is\nreflected in the file as an appendage to the answer. \nEvidence Rulings\nOn motion of the government two sets of documents offered by Applicant were\nexcluded. These were Exhibits AA and HH both of which related to criminal conduct of\nApplicant\u2019s former wife after their divorce and were not relevant to the allegations\nrelating to Applicant. One other document, Exhibit G 2, relating to a police report in\n2002 about Applicant\u2019s former wife in relation to the allegation against Applicant in SOR\n\u00b6 1.g. was admitted over the objection of the government (Tr. 21, 22).\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR\nof criminal conduct and drug involvement, with explanations.\nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor who tests vehicles\nfor the Army. During an eight year period between 1996 and 2004 he was the subject of\neight criminal conduct arrests and investigations. Between 1994 and 2003 he used\nmarijuana approximately 30 times and methamphetamine approximately 15 times\nduring periods of probation for the criminal conduct. He has had no law enforcement\nproblems since 2004 but was released from probation in June 2007. \nApplicant was married in May 2002 and separated in February 2004. When they\nwere married, his wife had one child from a previous relationship and was pregnant with\nApplicant\u2019s child. They were legally separated in May, 2002, and he was married again\nin 2006. He has one child less than a year old and a step child from the second\nmarriage union. \n\n3\nMany of the incidents that are the subjects of the allegations of criminal conduct\nagainst Applicant occurred during the period immediately before and during his first\nmarriage as a result of a difficult relationship and marriage. \nA summary of the allegations of criminal conduct follows:  \n1. Applicant was arrested in 1996 and charged with burglary and larceny. He was found\nguilty of larceny and sentenced to three years probation. He was asleep in the back of\nvehicle traveling with three other men when they stopped to steal a stereo from a car.\nAll were charged and convicted. \n2. He was arrested in 1998 for speeding and stop sign violation. He was found guilty\nand fined $238. \n3. In February 2000, he was charged with criminal trespass and criminal damage\n(deface). The case arose from being stuck in the mud in a farm field. He paid for\ndamages to the property and charges were dropped. \n4. On June 26, 2002, he was arrested and charged with possession of drug\nparaphernalia and sentenced to six months in jail, suspended, and three years\nprobation. The paraphernalia belonged to his wife but he said it was his to prevent her\nfrom having jail time since she was pregnant at the time. \n5. He was arrested and charged with speeding one month later in 2002, found guilty\nand fined $123. \n6. He was arrested and charged with reckless driving in June, 2003. He was found\nguilty and sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended, and fined $185 with two years\nprobation.\n7. Two months later in 2003, he was arrested and charged with two counts of domestic\nviolence. He was convicted and sentenced to fine of $280 suspended with $50\nrestitution, two years probation added to his prior probation and ordered to attend\ndomestic violence counseling. \n8. Three months later in 2003, he was arrested again on the same charges as the last\ncase and sentenced to six months in jail, suspended, a fine of $550, three years of\nprobation ending on June 22, 2007 and again ordered into domestic violence\ncounseling. This incident arose during a dispute with his wife and resulted in damage to\ntheir automobile. \n9. In April 2004, he was charged with consuming liquor in public and paid a $100 bond\nwhich was returned to him at the conclusion of the case. \n10. Three months later in 2004, he was investigated by the police concerning an\nallegation of child abuse which was concluded in his favor. \n\n4\nA summary of the allegations of drug use follows:  \n1. Between 1994 and 2003, he used marijuana approximately 30 times. \n2. During a period of 22 months in 2002 and 2003, he used methamphetamine\napproximately 15 times. \n3. These uses of illegal drugs occurred while serving periods of probation as set forth in\nthe criminal conduct summary. \nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisor who finds him to be dedicated and\nprofessional in his work and among the top 12 in a field of 110 employees (Tr. 46). He is\nadmired by family friends and colleagues for his work ethic and his ability to turn his life\naround in the last three years (Tr. 25-50 and Exhs. KK, LL, and MM). A large part of this\nchange is attributed to his second wife. He has received several awards from his\nemployer for his work (Exh. NN). \nSeveral of his family members and family friends who testified for him have\nserved as mentors for him. He shows strong indication of an intent to maintain the good\nconduct that he had the past three years. His personal representative in this matter who\nis retired military also has provided counseling.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.\nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline J Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG\u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns for an\napplicant. One of them that may be a disqualifying condition (DC) is a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses (AG \u00b6 31.a).\nPossible mitigating factors under the guideline that could be applicable are that\nso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened that it does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment (AG \u00b6 32.a), or\nthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation including but not limited to passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse, and a good employment record (AG \u00b6\n32.d). \nI conclude that the first mitigating factor relating to the passage of time is\napplicable to the first three allegations in the above enumeration. The first allegation in\n1996 was when he was 18 years old (SOR \u00b6 1.j); the second in 1998 was for speeding\nand was relatively insignificant for which he paid a fine (SOR \u00b6 1.i); and the third was\ndismissed after he made restitution to the aggrieved farmer (SOR \u00b6 1.h). \n\n6\nThe other allegations in the SOR are too recent and provide too much of a\npattern of bad conduct to warrant a finding of mitigation. This is particularly so since\nseveral occurred while he was on probation for earlier offenses. \nThe second mitigating factor raises the issue of rehabilitation. While Applicant\u2019s\nconduct during the past three years has been without fault, this is a relatively brief\nperiod of time considering the stretch of time during which the alleged criminal conduct\noccurred so I conclude that it is premature to apply the mitigating factor at this time. \nGuideline H Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to guideline for Drug Involvement is set forth in AG\n\u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the\nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), \nAG \u00b6 26 provides several conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\nWhile a period of over three years has elapsed since his use of illegal drugs and\nhe has apparently removed himself from contact with drug users, in view of the\nextensive time of the use of drugs and the fact that they were used while he was on\nprobation, it is premature to conclude that the security concern for drug use has been\nmitigated.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nWhile Applicant has shown evidence of rehabilitation and changes in his life style\nthrough the effect of his second marriage, his help from friends and family, and his\nactions in removing himself from contact with drugs and users of drugs, the period of\ntime has not been sufficient to warrant a whole person finding in his favor. The fact that\nhe fell under the influence of others after he had reached maturity, and continued to use\ndrugs even while on probation for two of the criminal matters raises questions about his\njudgment and rehabilitation that preclude the grant of a security clearance at this time.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, I conclude that Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and drug use and it is\npremature to grant him a security clearance.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b : Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: For Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:  Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b : Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.: Against Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance at this time.

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant\u2019s SF-86 omissions of his DuI and felony fraud charges/convictions In September 1996, Applicant was asked to complete an SF-86. Question 23d of the SF-86 asked if he had been charged or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs. In responding to the question, Applicant checked no (see ex. 1 and official notice 1). While not denying any intent to materially falsify the SF-86, he attributes his denial to his impression at the time that his 1978 DuI arrest and conviction had since been expunged, and, as such, he was not required to list it (R.T., at 35). In the same SF-86, Applicant answered no to question 21, which asked whether he had ever been charged and convicted of fraud. While Applicant does not deny any intent to materially falsify his SF-86, he attributes his denial of any felony fraud charge and conviction to his belief at the time that his fraud charge and conviction while attending college in 1974 had been resolved by expungement.

Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of alcohol-related arrests/convictions (two in all between 1978 and\n2002) and grand theft felony arrest/conviction in 1974 that he failed to list in his separate security\nclearance applications between 1996 and 2004. These omissions are imputed to have been made\ndeliberately out of concern his employer would find out and impact on his employment relationship.\nHis arrests/convictions were not disclosed until confronted in a second DSS interview and are not\nmitigated.  Besides these omissions, Applicant falsely induced and falsified a court filing in 2001\nabout his work and compensation status.  Allegations that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose\nhis wage garnishment between 1998 and were unsubstantiated.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 5, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on August 14, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on September 12, 2007.  A\nhearing was held on September 12, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of 13 exhibits and a revised blank\nQuestionnaire for national Security Positions (SF-86) which was received pursuant to the official\nnotice provisions of the Rule 201(a) of the F.R.Evi.  Applicant, in turn, relied on one witness\n(himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on September 20, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nPrior to the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR\nto add a falsification allegation under Guideline E.  Specifically, Department Counsel moved to add\nsubparagraph 1.f to allege as follows:\n \u201cOn or about October 19, 2007, you deliberately falsified material facts to an\nauthorized investigator for the Department of Defense when you denied that you had\never been charged with or convicted of any offense related to alcohol, when in truth\nyou had been charged with and convicted of Driving Under the Influence in 1978 and\nalso While Ability Impaired in 2002.\u201d  \nThere being no objection from Applicant, and good cause being demonstrated,  Department\u2019s motion\nto amend was granted.  In responding to the amended subparagraph 1.f, Applicant denied the new\nallegation.\n\n3\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified (a) his security clearance\napplications (SF-86) of June 2004, February 1998, and September 1996, by omitting his 2002 and\n1978 alcohol-related offenses, his 1974 theft conviction, and his wage garnishments between 1998\nand 2001 and (b) his filing a false statement in a local court about his claimed inactive work status\nand lack of compensation.  For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations,\nbut with qualifications.  He claimed to be under the false assumption that his records covering his\n2002 DuI charge and conviction were expunged and to be consistent he answered in the negative as\nto his earlier 1978 DuI charge/conviction, as well as his 1974 fraud charge/conviction.  He provides\nno explanations of the underlying circumstances with respect to his admitted deliberate omission of\nhis wage garnishment and claims to have had no proof of his employment status in connection with\nhis admitted filing of a false statement about his inactive status and lack of compensation in court\ndocuments.  Applicant affirmatively denied only the allegations in amended subparagraph 1.f that\nhe deliberately denied in an October 2004 DSS interview to being charged and convicted of his 1978\nand 2002.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 54-year-old senior consultant of a defense contractor who has held a security\nclearance since 1977 and seeks to retain his clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 omissions of his DuI and felony fraud charges/convictions\nIn September 1996, Applicant was asked to complete an SF-86.  Question 23d of the SF-86\nasked if he had been charged or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs. In responding\nto the question, Applicant checked no (see ex. 1 and official notice 1).  While not denying any intent\nto materially falsify the SF-86, he attributes his denial to his impression at the time that his 1978 DuI\narrest and conviction had since been expunged, and, as such, he was not required to list it (R.T., at\n35).  In the same SF-86, Applicant answered no to question 21, which asked whether he had ever\nbeen charged and convicted of fraud.  While Applicant does not deny any intent to materially falsify\nhis SF-86, he attributes his denial of any felony fraud charge and conviction to his belief at the time\nthat his fraud charge and conviction while attending college in 1974 had been resolved by\nexpungement.  Applicant claims no memory loss or confusion about the questions and cannot avoid\ndrawn inferences he knowingly and  willingly omitted the alcohol-related and fraud offenses out of\nconcern disclosure could adversely impact his security clearance and employment.\nIn February 1998, Applicant was asked to complete another SF-86.  He responded to the\nquestions inquiring about his alcohol-related and theft offenses in the same way he answered the\nquestions posed in his earlier 1996 SF-86.  He answered no to each question and attributed both\ndenials to his desire to maintain consistency with his previous answers and avoid embarrassment\nwith his employer (R.T., at 48-50).\n\n4\nSix years later (in June 2004), Applicant was asked to complete a third updated security\nclearance.  In this SF-86, he was asked in question 24 whether he had ever been charged with or\nconvicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs.  He answered no to this question.  Asked in\nquestion 21 of the same SF-86 whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony\noffense, he answered no to this question as well.  When queried in question 34 of the same SF-86\nwhether in the last seven years he had ever had his wages garnished for any reason, again, he\nanswered no.  In his signed, sworn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to deliberately omitting\nhis alcohol-related and fraud offenses.  These admissions have not been drawn and stand as official\nadmissions.\nApplicant attributes his negative responses to each of the questions inquiring about his prior\nalcohol and felony offenses to his belief that the underlying 2002 DuI charge/conviction had been\nexpunged.  He attributes his omissions of his 1978 DuI charge/conviction and his 1974 felony theft\nconviction to his desire to maintain consistency with the corresponding answers in each of his\nprevious security clearance applications (see response and ex. 5; R.T., at 52-53).  He claims no\nconfusion or memory loss over any of the underlying offenses. Nor does he provide any\ndocumentation to corroborate his claims that the underlying convictions were expunged or subject\nto expungement.\nLess amenable to reconciliation are Applicant\u2019s consistent omissions of his prior alcohol-\nrelated offenses of 1978 and 2002, respectively, and his 1974 felony fraud conviction.  Each of these\nunderlying offenses resulted in convictions.   He never listed either of the alcohol-related offenses\ndue primarily to his concern it could adversely affect his work relationships (see ex. 5).  He did not\nwant any of his supervisors or colleagues to find out about his fraud conviction either.  Such\nconcerns are attributable as well to his omissions of his 1974 grand theft arrest and conviction (see\nex. 4).  While Applicant insisted in his second DSS interview that he was not aware his 1974 arrest\nwas a felony when he completed each of his SF-86s, the charge itself is serious enough to impute\nsufficient knowledge of the offense\u2019s felony status as to suggest a concerted effort on Applicant\u2019s\npart to employ conscious denial.  Applicant\u2019s employment concerns, while understandable, are not\nenough to avert drawn inferences of knowing and wilful concealment of his alcohol-related and fraud\noffenses.  \nApplicant was first interviewed about his 2004 SF-86 by an DSS agent in October 2004.\nWhen asked about any prior alcohol-related and felony offenses by the agent, Applicant falsely\ndenied ever being charged or convicted of any alcohol-related or felony offenses (see ex. 5). Not\nuntil pressed by the same agent in a follow-up interview a month later (in November 2004) did he\nprovide detailed descriptions of the underlying circumstances and his ensuing alcohol-related arrests\nin December1978 and October 2002, respectively, and his fraud arrest in April 1974.  When pressed,\nhe acknowledged that listing any of the alcohol-related offenses would be embarrassing to him and\ncould impact his job relationship (see ex. 5; R.T., at 49).  Concern about the effect disclosure  might\nhave on his job is a much more plausible motivational reason for his wanting to omit his prior\nalcohol-related and fraud offenses than his claimed understanding about the expungement of the\nconvictions and his corresponding excuse from listing them for this reason.  Inferences warrant that\nApplicant\u2019s omissions of his alcohol and fraud offenses were deliberately made to avert potential\ndisclosure to his employer and  possible adverse effects on his employment relationship.  \nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 wage garnishment omissions\n\n5\nWhen queried in question 34 of the same 2004 SF-86 whether in the last seven years he had\never had his wages garnished for any reason, he answered no.  In his answer he admits to deliberately\nfailing to disclose prior wage garnishments and claims only that financial arrangements with his ex-\nwife are resolved and this type of omission occurred under unique circumstances and will not recur.\nApplicant provided no explanations of whether or not the garnishment writs were actually levied or\nattached to his wages.\nBoth in his response to the SOR and in his signed, sworn statement of November 2004,\nApplicant admitted to having his wages garnished during the period 1998 to 2001.  He attributed the\nissued garnishment writs to ongoing arguments over his former spouse\u2019s achieving court-approved\npermanent maintenance and ordered retroactive payments on any ordered maintenance (see ex. 5).\n Never informed by the court or his former spouse of her obtained judgments and garnishment orders\n(see exs. 8 through 12), he was asked by his company administrator how he wanted to handle the\ngarnishments.  Since the garnishments had not yet attached to any of Applicant\u2019s accounts, he agreed\nin October 2001 to make one lump sum payment of $33,000.00 in full settlement of any and all of\ncurrent and future maintenance obligations to his (see exs. 5 and 6; R.T., at 54-60).  Question 34 asks\nabout wage garnishment in the past tense and clearly references wages actually attached, not subject\nto attachment by dint of a court-approved garnishment writ.  Absent any evidence persuasive to\ncontradict Applicant\u2019s claimed pre-attachment settlement with his ex-wife, Applicant\u2019s settlement\nclaims are entitled to acceptance. \nBased on a fair reading of question 34 and Applicant\u2019s explanation that the court-entered\njudgments and issued garnishments never attached to his wages or bank accounts, Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations of his answers in his signed, sworn statement and at hearing (R.T., at 58-59) are worthy\nof acceptance.  Inferences warrant, accordingly, that Applicant did not deliberately omit his prior\ngarnishments when responding to question 34 of his June 2004 SF-86.\nApplicant\u2019s court filings regarding his work status\nBoth in his signed, sworn answer and in his November 2004 signed, sworn statement,\nApplicant acknowledged that he falsely filed a statement in a state court in 2001 that inaccurately\nstated  he was in an inactive work status and not receiving compensation (see response and ex. 5).\nHe admitted doing so to persuade his ex-wife and attorney to pursue a compromise arrangement with\nhim regarding her maintenance payments.  His answer is consistent with the statement he provided\nthe DSS agent in his November 2004 interview.  In this statement, he confirmed he called a company\nadministrator and asked him \u201cto send me a letter saying I was temporarily laid off in order to\nconvince my former spouse and her attorney that I needed to compromise arrangement regarding the\nmaintenance\u201d (ex. 5). Then he states that \u201che was not really laid-off but was no longer working on\nlong term projects\u201d (ex. 5).  Nowhere in the statement does he suggest he was actually fired or laid\noff, or received no compensation during this supposed lay-off period.  Both by his response and his\ninterview statements his exchange with his administrator represents a clear and consistent  account\nof what transpired.   While Applicant tried initially at hearing to claim he was actually fired by his\nemployer in January 2001 and generated no significant income after that (R.T., at 38-39), he\nultimately acknowledged to be available after that date for short term assignments in which he earned\nsome income (R.T., at 61-66).  Applicant\u2019s attempted corrections are not substantive enough to\nmaterially detract from his earlier acknowledgments. \n\n6\nWhile it is less than clear from Applicant\u2019s acknowledged exchange with his company\nadministrator in 2001 whether the administrator actually wrote such a letter to him, Applicant does\nacknowledge filing a letter to this effect in the court presiding over his ex-wife\u2019s maintenance\npetition.  While he does insist he took a substantial drop in income from his employer in 2001, he\nhas never suggested he had no income at all during this 2001 time frame.  Applicant\u2019s subsequent\nhearing claims that he experienced a substantial loss of income during this pertinent period in 2001\n(R.T., at ) does not alter the inferential effect of his admissions in both his response and November\n2004 DSS statement (see ex. 5). \nThat Applicant was ultimately successful in working out a compromise maintenance\nsettlement with his ex-wife (resulting in an agreed $33,000.00 lump sum settlement payment to her)\ndoes not undue his acknowledged deceptive means he employed to produce such a settlement.\nAccordingly, inferences warrant of Applicant\u2019s filing a false statement in a pending court proceeding\nin 2001 indicating he was in an inactive work status and not receiving compensation. Further,\ninferences warrant that Applicant filed such a letter to attempt to persuade his ex-wife and her\nattorney that he did not have available compensatory funds from his work to satisfy her maintenance\ndemands and cover the entered judgment and issued writs of garnishment and needed a compromise\narrangement with her. \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nBurden of Proof\n\n7\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\nsecurity clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his\nor her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a senior consultant for a defense contractor who has held a security clearance\nfor over 30 years and has raised security concerns over his alleged (a) omissions in the security\nclearance applications he completed between 1996 and 2004,(b) a false statement about his\nemployment status he filed in a pending court that was presiding over his ex-wife\u2019s maintenance\npetition, and \u00a9) false statements he made to a DSS investigator in October 2004 about his alcohol-\nrelated and felony fraud offenses. \nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 and DSS interview omissions\nParticularly serious and difficult  to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for\nholding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s omissions of his two\nprior alcohol-related charges and convictions in 1978 and 2002, respectively, and his felony fraud\ncharge/conviction in 1974, in the security clearance applications he completed in 1996, 1998 and\n2004, and his withholding of information pertaining to these offenses until he was confronted in an\nensuing DSS interview in November 2004.  So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see\nclassified information that candor lapses must be scrupulously evaluated.   \nApplicable disqualifying conditions under the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct\nare as follows: DC 16(a) (the deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation\nof relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\n\n8\nresponsibilities) and 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other\nofficial government representative).  \nApplicant\u2019s manifest reasons for omitting his prior alcohol and fraud offenses (i.e.,\nembarrassment over disclosing any of his alcohol and fraud offenses that he had historically omitted\nin prior SF-86s, for fear of impact on his job) have never been considered sufficient by the Appeal\nBoard to mitigate raised trust concerns associated with the omissions.  Mitigation difficulty is\ncompounded by his failure to promptly correct his SF-86 omissions before being confronted in his\nensuing second DSS interview in November 2004.  In the past, the Appeal Board has denied\napplicants availability of the predecessor mitigating condition of MC 17(a) (the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts) where the applicant has waited many months to timely correct a known\nomission. Compare ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (Appeal Bd. January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-\n1390 (Appeal Bd. January 1995). \nBy omitting his prior alcohol-related and fraud offenses in his security clearance applications\nand ensuing October 2004 DSS interview, Applicant concealed materially important background\ninformation needed for the government to properly process and evaluate his security updates.  His\nattributed reasons for his omissions (fear of adverse impact on his job) are not sustainable grounds\nfor averting inferences of falsification.  Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding his omissions\nof his DuI/felony fraud charges and lack of any prompt, good faith corrections, Applicant\u2019s claims\nlack the necessary probative showing to avert drawn conclusions that he knowingly and deliberately\nwithheld material background information about his prior alcohol-related and felony fraud\nconvictions in both the security clearance applications he completed and the first DSS interview he\nsubmitted to in October 2004. Accordingly, subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c and 1.f are concluded\nunfavorable to Applicant.\nBy contrast, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to SOR allegations that Applicant\ndeliberately omitted the writs of wage garnishment issued against him between 1998 and 2001, but\nnever attached to Applicant\u2019s wages or earnings.  Applicant\u2019s proofs that the garnishment writs were\nnever levied on his wages before he worked out a lump sum settlement with his ex-wife were\naccepted.  Without proofs of actual attachments or levies on Applicant\u2019s wages, Applicant could\ntruthfully claim that his wages were never garnished.  Question 34 of his 2004 SF-86 looks to actual\nwage garnishments in the past tense and manifestly does not cover issued writs that were not served.\nAccordingly, the allegations covered in subparagraph 1.d are unsubstantiated. \nApplicant\u2019s false court statement re: his employment status\nSecurity significant, too, is Applicant\u2019s admitted statement he filed in 2001 with the court\npresiding over his ex-wife\u2019s maintenance claims.  After enlisting his company administrator to send\nhim a letter misstating the status of his employment, he then filed a statement with the court\nindicating he was in inactive work and not receiving compensation.  Neither of these statements were\ntrue, for by his own accounts, Applicant was never actually laid off without pay.  Applicant\u2019s hearing\nclaims that he was never in an inactive work status are belied by his response admissions and the\nanswers he provided the DSS agent in his second interview with Applicant in November 2004. \n\n9\nApplicable to Applicant\u2019s admitted deceptive actions is DC 16(d) (credible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient for an\nadverse determination, but which when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release\nof proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other government\nprotected information; \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources).\nBoth Applicant\u2019s inducement of his company administrator to file a false statement concerning his\nemployment and compensation status and his ensuing filing of a false statement in court regarding\nhis employment status reflect material acts of deceit that are not mitigated under any of the\npotentially available mitigating conditions of the Guidelines for personal conduct.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s deceitful actions with regards to hi ex-wife\u2019s maintenance judgment\nand garnishment writs from the standpoint of both the guidelines and a whole-person assessment,\nApplicant\u2019s cannot be considered isolated, but rather reflect a pattern of dishonest conduct that\nreflect adversely on his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  Consequently, the allegations\ncovered by subparagraph 1.e must be concluded unfavorable to Applicant.  Taking into account all\nof the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the\nE2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraph 1.e of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E2\n2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, I make\nthe following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n10\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 43 years old, unmarried, and has a college degree. She works as a flight test engineer for a defense contractor. She started that job in March 2006. A manager at the company evaluates her work as very competent and thorough. He considers her trustworthy, responsible, and a person of integrity. (Tr. 24-26, 55; Exhibits 1, B) Applicant worked for a previous employer as a materials analyst from September 1994 until being laid off work in January 2003. During that time her income, because of overtime pay, was $90,459 in 1998, $102,023 in 1999, $92,579 in 2000, and $63,182 in 2001. It dropped further in 2002 to $57,955, then to $17,501 in 2003 when she was laid off work. She returned to working for that employer in January 2004, until November 2005, when she was laid off again. Her income in 2004 was $56,083, and in 2005 was $52,995. During her layoff periods, she collected 3 unemployment and union supplemental payments, and sought work continuously. After starting her present job in March 2006, her income rose to $71,400 annually. (Tr. 26-30, 54, 84-86) Applicant purchased a house in 1996, and she still owns it. It is now valued at $208,00",

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCaroline H. Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 43 years old, and works for a defense contractor as a materials analyst.  She\nincurred about $60,000 in credit card debt, which she tried to repay through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nThe bankruptcy was dismissed after 31 months because she was laid off from her job and could not\npay the monthly payments to the trustee.  She has repaid eight of ten delinquent debts listed in the\nSOR.  Applicant made sufficient disclosures on her security clearance application to inform the\nGovernment of her financial difficulties.  Applicant mitigated the financial considerations and\npersonal conduct security concerns.  Clearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On March 30, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on  December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on April 26, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on June 21, 2007.  On September 19,\n2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  \nThe Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  I\nallowed the record to remain open until October 3, 2007, for Applicant to submit additional\ndocuments.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 28, 2007.\nApplicant submitted documents, and then continued to submit additional documents on a\nweekly basis until November 19, 2007, when I closed the record.  I admitted all of her additional\ndocuments in the interest of fairness, and because these documents were relevant and probative\nregarding the SOR allegations.  I marked them Exhibits F to PP.  The Government had no objection\nto the admission of these documents into evidence.  At the hearing the Government withdrew SOR\nallegation subparagraph 1.b because Applicant never filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001, as the\nbankruptcy court records show and the letter from her attorney demonstrates. (Exhibit A). \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to SOR allegations Subparagraph 1.a, 1.f, 1g to 1.j are incorporated\nhere as findings of fact.  Applicant denied all other allegations.  After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following\nadditional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 43 years old, unmarried, and has a college degree.  She works as a flight test\nengineer for a defense contractor.  She started that job in March 2006.  A manager at the company\nevaluates her work as very competent and thorough.  He considers her trustworthy, responsible, and\na person of integrity. (Tr. 24-26, 55; Exhibits 1, B)\nApplicant worked for a previous employer as a materials analyst from September 1994 until\nbeing laid off work in January 2003.  During that time her income, because of overtime pay, was\n$90,459 in 1998, $102,023 in 1999, $92,579 in 2000, and $63,182 in 2001.  It dropped further in\n2002 to $57,955, then to $17,501 in 2003 when she was laid off work.  She returned to working for\nthat employer in January 2004, until November 2005, when she was laid off again.  Her income in\n2004 was $56,083, and in 2005 was $52,995.  During her layoff periods, she collected\n\n3\nunemployment and union supplemental payments, and sought work continuously. After starting her\npresent job in March 2006, her income rose to $71,400 annually. (Tr. 26-30, 54, 84-86)\nApplicant purchased a house in 1996, and she still owns it.  It is now valued at $208,000.\nDuring her layoff periods, and continuously since she bought the house, Applicant paid her mortgage\npayments monthly.  In September 2001, she realized she had too much credit card debt to repay\npromptly, about $60,000 worth, so she consulted with an attorney and filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nShe listed her debts, and was paying $805 monthly.  The plan was for 48 months.  When she was laid\noff in January 2003, she was unable to continue the payments.  The bankruptcy was dismissed in\nApril 2003, as a result of her financial inability to make the regular payments.  Applicant received\nthe dismissal papers, and thought they meant she had been discharged in bankruptcy of her debts.\nDuring the bankruptcy, she paid $24,800 over 31 months on her debts. (Tr. 29-35, 55, 64, 65, 79-83;\nExhibits 1, 2, 4, 6, G, H; Answer)\nApplicant has 10 delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  She has only two unpaid debts\nremaining.  Between September 2006 and November 2007, Applicant paid $10,165.63 on her debts\nlisted in the SOR.  Her monthly payments are $900.

She makes regular payments on each.  She\ncancelled all other credit cards. (Tr. 59,60, 71)\nApplicant had a security clearance from 1990 to 1994 with no violations on her record.  On\nMarch 21, 2006, she completed a security clearance application (SCA).  She answered the financial\nbackground questions in Question 28.a (180 day payment delinquencies in the past 7 years) and 28.b.\n(currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt payment) with negative replies to both questions.\nApplicant thought the questions referred to her current debts, which were being paid, and not the\ndebts she listed in the 2003 Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  She assumed those debts had been discharged,\nnot that the bankruptcy was dismissed because she no longer made payments because of her job\nlayoff.  Applicant did disclose in answering Question 27 (Your Financial Record) that she filed a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy in the past seven years, and had judgments against her in the past seven years\nwhich had not been paid.  She provided additional information about the Chapter 13 bankruptcy,\nthough it was listed as a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Tr. 12, 13, 62; Exhibit 1)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\n\n6\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\n\n7\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations Applicant incurred about $60,000 in credit card debt in the late\n1990s when she earned a lot of overtime pay.  As the overtime lessened, and her income dropped,\nshe found she was unable to repay the debts in a timely manner.  Then, her job layoff in January\n2003, compounded her repayment problems.  Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions\n\u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), \u00b6 19.b. (indebtedness caused by frivolous or\nirresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt), and \u00b619.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply.  Applicant overspent and failed to save money to repay these debts.\nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2001, in an attempt to repay her debts.\nShe faithfully paid the bankruptcy trustee $805 monthly at the rate of $200 weekly, deducted from\nher paycheck.  When she was laid off from work in January 2003, she was unable to continue the\npayments.  The bankruptcy was then dismissed for failure to maintain the payments.  She suffered\ntwo periods of extended layoffs, both adversely affecting her ability to repay her debts.  Since 2006,\nApplicant has been repaying the debts herself.  She has paid over $10,000 on those debts.  She repaid\neight of the ten delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  One remaining debt she cannot recognize.  The\nother debt the creditor will not agree to a $50 monthly repayment plan.  Applicant is about to pay\noff on debt because she has been paying $500 monthly.  Some of that money would then be used to\nrepay other debts in sequence until she could save enough money to pay the remaining two debts\nwith larger monthly payments.  \nThe Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable are \u00b620.b (the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances), \u00b620.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control),\nand \u00b620.d (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts).  The two lengthy layoffs, and the reduction in her income because overtime was not available,\nhurt Applicant\u2019s ability to repay her debts.  As she continued to pay her mortgage, and tried to repay\nher debts through the bankruptcy, she exhibited responsible behavior under the circumstances.  There\nis clear evidence her financial problems are under control and she has repaid over $31,000 in debts\nsince 2003.  As all debts are paid or resolved, she demonstrated the problems are under control as\na result of her good faith efforts to repay the debts.\n\n8\nPersonal Conduct Applicant did not disclose her financial delinquencies on her SCA.  The\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (DC) which might be applicable is \u00b616.a (involving\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, or determine trustworthiness).  However, Applicant disclosed her unpaid\njudgment which is listed in Subparagraph 1.j., and her Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  Both of these\ndisclosures informed the Government that Applicant had delinquent debt problems.  Her\ninterpretation that Question 28 requested information regarding her current debts, which she was\npaying regularly and were not delinquent either for 90 or 180 days, is reasonable and credible.\nHence, I conclude there was no deliberate omission or falsification by Applicant, who had no intent\nto falsify.  The totality of her disclosures shows her intention to inform the Government of her\nfinancial history.  Therefore, no DC apply, and no MC need be considered or applied.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).\nI considered Applicant\u2019s age and work history at the time she incurred $60,000 in credit card\ndebt.  Those were not prudent expenditures, but she expected her high income to continue and she\nwould be able to repay the debt.  When she could not pay, she took the initiative and entered Chapter\n13 bankruptcy to repay her debts.  Absent her subsequent layoff, she would have repaid the debts in\nanother 17 months, according to the plan.  She has not repeated her pattern of expenditures, and has\nengaged in a new course of action resulting in the cancellation of all older credit cards, while\nresponsibly paying the amounts charged on her current cards.  She also has repaid another $10,000\nin debt since 2006.  These are behavioral changes showing she learned a valuable lesson about debt\nand personal finances.  There is no likelihood of recurrence or continuation in her current pattern of\ndebt repayment.  Also, there is no potential for coercion, pressure, exploitation, or duress, because\nApplicant made full disclosures about her finances and is repaying her debts.\nTherefore, I conclude the Financial Considerations security concern for Applicant.  I\nconclude the Personal Conduct security concern for Applicant.  Lastly, I conclude the Whole Person\nconcept for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n9\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDavid P. Price, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a dual citizen of Lebanon and the U.S. since she acquired her U.S. citizenship\nin August 2003. Foreign influence concerns persist because of her close bonds to her parents and\nsisters who are resident citizens of Lebanon, and to her brother, a Lebanese citizen living in the\nUnited Arab Emirates. Foreign preference concerns raised by her possession and use of a Lebanese\npassport are mitigated by her surrender of the foreign passport. Clearance is denied.\n\nSee Consular Information Sheet, Lebanon, dated October 20, 2006 (I); Background Note: Lebanon, dated\n1\nFebruary 2007 (II); Travel Warning, dated June 14, 2007 (III); Country Reports on Terrorism-2006, Chapters 2 (IV),\n3 (V), and 6 (VI),  released April 30, 2007; Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006: Lebanon, dated March\n6, 2007 (VII); and Fact Sheet Foreign Terrorist Organizations, dated October 11, 2005 (VIII).\nSee CRS Report for Congress: Lebanon, dated November 28, 2006 (IX).\n2\nThe three Justice Department press releases, dated March 29, 2006 (X), March 1, 2005 ((XI), and August 9,\n3\n2005 (XII), concern criminal proceedings in U.S. District Court are hearsay and do not involve Applicant. The March\n29, 2006, press release reports the indictment in the District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, of 19 individuals for\noperating a global racketeering conspiracy in support of Hizballah between 1996 and 2004. The March 1, 2005, press\nrelease reports the guilty plea of a U.S. resident in that same district court to conspiracy to provide material support to\nHizballah, a designated foreign terrorist organization. The August 9, 2005, press release reports the guilty plea in the\nEastern District of Arkansas of a Canadian-Lebanese dual citizen to criminal charges: attempting to provide material\nsupport to Hizballah, attempting to export military night vision equipment to Hizballah, conspiracy to export sensitive\nmilitary equipment from the U.S. without a license, and to money laundering.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) on May 7, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (foreign influence) and\nGuideline C (foreign preference) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December\n29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on\nMay 31, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned\nto me on July 25, 2007.\nI convened a hearing on October 17, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Two government exhibits\n(Ex. 1- 2) and nine Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-I) were admitted, and testimony was taken from six\nwitnesses in addition to the Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 25,\n2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn July 20, 2007, the government requested administrative notice be taken of several\nproposed facts concerning Lebanon and the organization Hizballah (Hezbollah). For source\ndocumentation the government relied on publications from the U.S. State Department  and the\n1\nCongressional Research Service,  and on press releases from the U.S. Department of Justice.\n2\n3\nApplicant did not object to my review of the government\u2019s source documents for purposes of\nadministrative notice but expressed a general concern as to the weight and/or relevance of some of\nthe information proposed for notice. After weighing the reliability of the source documentation and\n\nThe criminal support for Hizballah is relevant to the extent it shows Hizballah remains an active terrorist\n4\norganization that continues to garner support from rouge individuals.\n3\nassessing the relevancy and materiality of the facts proposed, I took administrative notice of certain\nfacts as set forth below.4\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s parents (SOR \u00b6 1.a),\nthree sisters (SOR  \u00b6 1.c), one aunt, uncles and several cousins (\u00b6 1.f) are resident citizens of\nLebanon; that one brother is a citizen of Lebanon living in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) (SOR\n\u00b6 1.e); that she sends her parents between $100 and $200 each month (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that she\ntraveled to Lebanon in at least 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d).\nUnder Guideline C, foreign preference, Applicant was alleged to be exercising dual citizenship with\nLebanon and the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and to have used a Lebanese passport instead of her U.S. passport\nto enter and exit Lebanon in at least 2003 and/or 2004 (SOR \u00b6 2.b).\nWhen she answered the SOR, Applicant admitted the Lebanese citizenship and residency of\nher parents, sisters, and extended family members, the Lebanese citizenship and U.A.E. residency\nof her brother, her voluntary monetary support for her parents in Lebanon, and her travels to Lebanon\nto see them. She averred that another brother, who is a U.S. resident citizen, has applied for her\nparents to immigrate to the U.S. Applicant denied any preference for Lebanon despite her dual\ncitizenship and use of her Lebanese passport. She claimed she used the passport to avoid the expense\nof obtaining visas. She indicated that she had surrendered her Lebanese passport and had no intent\nto use a Lebanese passport again.\nAfter a thorough consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, and having agreed\nto take administrative notice, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 33-year-old senior electrical engineer who earned a master\u2019s degree in\nelectrical engineering from a public university in the U.S. in October 2002. She has worked for her\ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since about October 2002, and seeks a secret-level security\nclearance so that she can participate in the systems integration and further optimization of functional\nelements she has designed and bring her expertise to bear in the discussion of conceptual designs as\nthe company pursues new business opportunities. Her continued employment is not contingent on\nthe clearance.\nApplicant was born in Lebanon in April 1974. She is the youngest of eight children (five\ndaughters and three sons) born to Lebanese native citizens who are now in their early 70s. Her father\nwas a street vendor before he retired. Her mother did not work outside the home. \nApplicant graduated as valedictorian with a bachelor of science degree in electrical\nengineering and communications from a Lebanese university in summer 1996. In December 1996,\nApplicant entered into an arranged marriage to a Lebanese native who had immigrated to the U.S.\nApplicant first met him in 1995 when he came to Lebanon for vacation. Applicant came to the U.S.\non a spouse visa after their wedding in Lebanon. The marriage lasted but one year.\n\n4\nIn May 1997, Applicant began working as a microwave design engineer in the U.S. On the\nrecommendation of her supervisor, Applicant began graduate studies toward a master\u2019s degree in\nengineering at a public university in September 1997 while working full-time. Applicant was hard\nworking, an intelligent engineer. In May 2000, Applicant started a new job as an electrical engineer\nfor a micro circuits company. She was laid off in July 2002.\nIn August 2002, Applicant married her current spouse, who is a native of the U.S. They met\nin fall 1998 while taking the same night class in microwave engineering at the university. In mid-\nOctober 2002, Applicant was awarded her master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering.\nThat same month, she was hired as a digital design engineer by her current employer on the\nstrong recommendation of the supervisor with whom she had worked closely from 1997 to 1999. He\nhad moved on to the company three years before, and was happy to recommend Applicant because\nof her diligence when they worked together in the past. Applicant continued to be a conscientious\nemployee, committed to her work, reliable, professional in her dealings with coworkers. She has\nconsistently demonstrated critical key abilities in the field of digital, radio frequency, and analog\nelectronic circuit design and testing. Managing engineers and coworkers familiar with her work over\nthe past five years, but knowing little of her family situation in Lebanon, consider her to be a\nvaluable asset, ethical, and worthy of a security clearance. Her friends have found her to be honest,\nsincere, willing to help, and dedicated to her family.\nOn August 7, 2003, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen, taking an oath to renounce\nall foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms\nor perform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. On August\n15, 2003, Applicant was issued her U.S. passport. In September 2003, Applicant and her spouse\ntraveled to Lebanon to visit her family. She used her Lebanese passport to enter Lebanon so that she\nwould not have to pay a $20 fee required of U.S. citizens. (Tr. 175)\nOn November 2003, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86) that was\nlater reviewed and re-signed on July 19, 2004. Applicant disclosed that she  recently acquired U.S.\ncitizenship and a U.S. passport, but also that she was a dual citizen of Lebanon and held a Lebanese\npassport valid to April 30, 2006. She listed her parents and siblings only by name and date of birth\n(with errors as to her mother\u2019s and eldest sister\u2019s birth dates), providing citizenship information for\nonly the siblings who had been naturalized in the U.S. and were living in the U.S.  As for her parents\nand other siblings, \u201cUNK\u201d was erroneously entered in response to whether the listed family member\nwas deceased. Applicant reported foreign travel to Lebanon in December 1997, December 1998,\nAugust 2000, August 2001, and September 2003, and weekend trips to Canada in June 2000,\nFebruary 2001, March 2002, June 2002, August 2002, and September 2002.\nApplicant and her spouse traveled to Lebanon to visit her parents and siblings in July 2004,\nJuly 2005, and December 2006. They took their daughter with them on the last two trips, and\nregistered with authorities as required on all their trips. They stayed with her parents while in\nLebanon at her parents\u2019 residence outside of Beirut, and had in-person contact with her three sisters\nduring these trips. Applicant used her Lebanese passport to enter Lebanon in July 2004. The record\n\nWhen she answered the SOR, which alleges that she used her Lebanese passport during her trips in at least\n5\n2003 and/or 2004 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), Applicant indicated she used her Lebanese passport once in/out of Lebanon. Yet, at her\nhearing, she testified, \u201cI believe I used it two times before I know I\u2019m not supposed to use it and that was just to enter\nLebanon because it was easier. There was a line for citizens, a line for non citizens, and there is a fee if you are a non,\nif you don\u2019t hold a passport, so it was just a convenience at that point.\u201d (Tr. 159) Applicant now admits that she used\nher foreign passport in lieu of her U.S. passport at least twice, which according to the record would have been in\nSeptember 2003 and July 2004. It is not clear whether the July 2005 trip was before or after her interview with the\ninvestigator. If before, she is likely to have used her Lebanese passport on that trip but it was not clearly established.\nLittle is known about the interview apart from Applicant\u2019s testimony that she acted on the advice of the\n6\ninvestigator with regard to her surrender of the foreign passport.\n5\nis inconclusive as to which passport she used to enter Lebanon in July 2005.  In February 2006,\n5\nApplicant surrendered her Lebanese passport to the Consulate General of Lebanon on the advice of\nthe investigator who had interviewed her for her background investigation,  so she entered Lebanon\n6\nin December 2006 on her U.S. passport. Applicant does not intend to reacquire a Lebanese passport.\nApplicant and her spouse had planned to travel to Lebanon in September 2006 but postponed\nthe trip until December 2006 due to the war between Hizballah and Israel. During their trip in\nDecember 2006, Applicant and her spouse saw no signs of hostile activity in the vicinity of her\nfamily members,  but they were unsuccessful in an attempt to go to downtown Beirut because \u201cthere\nwas stuff going on.\u201d (Tr. 127) They are planning to return to visit her family in December 2007, but\nhave not yet made travel arrangements to avoid having to cancel in the event of an outbreak of\nhostilities in Lebanon. None of her relatives living in Lebanon has visited her in the U.S. Her parents\ndo not speak English and it is too difficult to get a visa for them. A sister had been twice denied a\nvisa to travel to the U.S.\nIf she could keep only one citizenship, Applicant would choose to retain her U.S. citizenship,\nalthough she is not willing to renounce her Lebanese citizenship to obtain a security clearance.\nKnowing she can lawfully keep her foreign citizenship, her preference is to remain a dual citizen\n(\u201cmaybe when I retire, maybe it will give me some benefits, if Lebanon is a peaceful place and I\nthing of maybe owning a summer house, or a winter house probably would be better, so it has maybe\nsome benefits in the very, very, long future.\u201d). (Tr. 174)\nApplicant and her spouse own their home in the U.S. As of September 2006, the property was\nassessed at $577,000. As of October 2007, the mortgage balance was $378,050.20. (Ex. A) Applicant\nhad her own checking and savings account in which she had a total balance on deposit of $3,576.90.\nA joint savings account had $11,442.12 on deposit. (Ex. C) Applicant is vested in a retirement\naccount at work totaling $61,731.87, and has $34,397.72 in an individual retirement account. (Ex.\nD) Her spouse is employed by a defense contractor as a senior engineer and program manager for\nspace components. He holds a secret-level security clearance, which was granted to him in June\n2005. (Ex. E) Her spouse has $13,655.33 in retirement assets with his current employer, $47,675.81\nin another 401(k) account, and $26,809.31 in an individual retirement account. They also had\n$3,210.61 in a college savings plan (529 plan) for their young daughter. (Ex. D) Applicant has no\nfinancial assets in Lebanon.\nAs of October 2007, Applicant\u2019s parents and three of her sisters were still resident citizens\nof Lebanon, living within a 15-minute radius by foot. One brother was still living in the U.A.E., and\n\n6\nthree siblings were in the U.S. Applicant had telephone contact with her parents once weekly.\nApplicant and her three siblings in the U.S. were each contributing $400 monthly toward the\nfinancial support of their parents. Applicant was giving a brother her share to wire over to her\nparents. She and her siblings in the U.S. had recently agreed to increase their contributions from\n$100 to $400 monthly as their parents had increased prescription costs. One of Applicant\u2019s brothers\nhas applied for their parents to immigrate from Lebanon to the U.S. Applicant\u2019s parents own their\ncurrent residence, an apartment in Lebanon. They also receive rental income from land that her father\ninherited. \nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister (sister #1) is 49 years old and employed as an elementary public\nschool principal in Lebanon. She is a widow with four children whose ages range from 12 to 22.\nApplicant converses with her sister by telephone a few times a month. Applicant\u2019s next eldest sibling\n(sister #2) is 47 years old and is married to a pediatrician in private practice in Lebanon. Sister #2\nhas three children, all minors, and is employed as a public school inspector after a career as a\nclassroom teacher. Applicant calls this sister once a month. Sister #3 in Lebanon is 45 years old and\nunmarried. She teaches English in a private school. Applicant speaks with her by telephone a few\ntimes a week. Sister #3 was twice denied a visa to visit Applicant in the U.S. Applicant understands\nit was because her sister is single and owns no property, so there was a fear that she would remain\nin the U.S. A brother in the U.S. (brother #2) is sponsoring this sister\u2019s immigration to the U.S.,\nhaving filed an application three or four years ago.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings in Lebanon know that she is an engineer but she has not told\nthem who she works for or that she is applying for a security clearance. Applicant is aware of her\nresponsibility to report to her employer any pressure, direct or indirect, placed on her through her\nrelatives in Lebanon. To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, none of her relatives had been targeted as of\nOctober 2007.\nApplicant has two uncles, one aunt, and ten cousins who are resident citizens of Lebanon.\nShe does not have a close relationship with these extended family members. She sees them no more\nthan once a year when she is in Lebanon, and otherwise has no contact.\nApplicant has three brothers and one sister living outside of Lebanon. The eldest (brother #1,\nage 43) is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Lebanon since his naturalization in the U.S. in July 2002.\nHe has been in the U.S. more than 19 years and is engaged to a native U.S. citizen. He is a computer\nengineer. His fiancee is a thoracic surgeon who has a personal relationship with Applicant and her\nspouse. She testified to Applicant and Applicant\u2019s brother being \u201cscared that their family is [in\nLebanon] but not having any concern that the family\u2019s activities would put them in the line of danger\nin any way.\u201d (Tr. 95) Applicant\u2019s future sister-in-law does not doubt that Applicant would \u201cdo the\nright thing\u201d if her relatives were pressured. She considers Applicant to be \u201cvery honest, very\nstraightforward, a very strong sense of morals and ethics . . . a very caring person.\u201d (Tr. 92-93)\nBrother #2 is a 41-year-old mechanical engineer who lives not far from Applicant with his spouse\nand two-year-old daughter. In the U.S. since 1988, he is a dual citizen of Lebanon and the U.S. since\nhis naturalization in August 2001. His spouse is a native U.S. citizen who is employed as a technical\nwriter. Brother #3 is a 39-year-old mechanical engineer working in the U.A.E. He is married to a\nRussian citizen, whom he met while pursuing his bachelor\u2019s and graduate degrees in Russia. They\nboth have permanent residency in Canada. They have a five-year-old daughter and are pursuing\n\nHizballah has been designated by the U.S. Department of State as a foreign terrorist organization  as has Asbat\n7\nal-Ansar, against which the Lebanese government has taken action. See State Department\u2019s Fact Sheet, Foreign Terrorist\nOrganizations, dated October 11. 2005.\n7\nCanadian citizenship. Sister #4 is a 36-year-old computer science professional working in California.\nShe and her spouse are both naturalized U.S. citizens.  \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Lebanon is a parliamentary republic at the\neastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. From 1975 to 1991, it was convulsed in a religious and\nethnically-driven civil war. Regional tensions persisted, with the terrorist organization Hizballah7\ntargeting Israel from within Lebanon and Israel retaliating. Israeli troops withdrew from Lebanon\nin May 2000 after 22 years of Israeli occupation. The level of violence along the Israeli-Lebanon\nfront decreased dramatically until a month-long war between Hizballah and Israel in July/August\n2006. The conflict ended in a cease-fire imposed by a United Nations Security Council resolution\nand enforced by the presence of international peacekeeping forces in Lebanon.\nSyria, which views Lebanon as part of its territory, maintained a military presence in Lebanon\nfrom March 1976 until April 2005, when it withdrew under international pressure. Syrian\nintelligence assets remain in Lebanon, and Syria continues to have a strong influence in Lebanese\npolitics.  Influential persons in Lebanon critical of Syrian interference in Lebanon have been targeted\nfor assassination, and more than 32 have died since October 2004. The U.S. considers Syria to be\na state sponsor of terrorism. Pro-Syrian forces, led by Hizballah, began months of massive\ndemonstrations and occasional violence in November 2006 with the aim of bringing down Lebanon\u2019s\ndemocratically elected government.\n        \nLebanon has a mixed record with respect to human rights. The government had taken\nsignificant steps to increase freedom of assembly and association and to prevent unauthorized\neavesdropping of private citizens until the conflict between Israel and Hizballah in 2006. There were\nno reports of politically motivated disappearances caused by government forces, but security forces\nabused detainees and in some instances used torture in 2006. There were instances of arbitrary arrest,\ngovernment corruption and lack of transparency, restrictions on freedom of the press, limitations on\nfreedom of movement for unregistered refugees, violence against women and children.  \nLebanon does not have a history of targeting U.S. citizens to obtain protected or sensitive\ninformation. The U.S. seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties to Lebanon, and to help preserve\nLebanon\u2019s independence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity. The U.S. supports the\nfull implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1559 that required all remaining foreign\nforces withdraw from Lebanon and the disarming of all militias, including Hizballah and several\nPalestinian groups in Lebanon. The Lebanese government has not taken the necessary steps to disarm\nextralegal armed groups, including Hizballah. Hizballah has a strong bloc of supporters in Lebanon\u2019s\nparliament who continue to view it as a political party. The Lebanese government has taken action\nagainst extremists such as Asbat al-Ansar that has been linked to al-Qaida, but threats of attacks\nagainst western and Lebanese government interests by the extremist group Fatah Al-Islam and other\nmilitant groups led the U.S. State Department in June 2007 to strongly urge American citizens to\ndeter travel to Lebanon.\n\nThe situation in the U.A.E. is relevant because Applicant is close to her brother, who resides there. What can\n8\nbe distilled from the government\u2019s source documents (see Country Reports on Terrorism, April 30, 2007) is generally\nfavorable.\n8\nThe government of the U.A.E. repeatedly condemned terrorist acts in the region in 2006, and\nit was generally cooperative in counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts. Cooperation has been\nhampered by the lack of a mutual legal assistance treaty between the U.A.E. and the U.S.8\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue [her] security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, foreign influence, foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or\nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6). Applicant\u2019s parents (SOR \u00b6 1.a), three sisters (SOR \u00b6 1.c), two uncles,\nan aunt, and several cousins (SOR \u00b6 1.f)  are resident citizens of her native Lebanon. Another brother\nis a Lebanese citizen living in the U.A.E. (\u00b6 1.e). Applicant admits she has close relationships with\nher parents and siblings. Her contacts with them, at least once weekly with her mother and sister #3\nand monthly with her father and other siblings, bear that out. Disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a)\n\n9\n(contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) is implicated.\nSince immigrating to the U.S. in late December 1996, Applicant traveled to Lebanon eight\ntimes to visit her parents and sisters. She has been accompanied by her spouse since their marriage\nin August 2002, and they took their daughter with them in July 2005 and December 2006. These\ntrips to Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.d) are not security disqualifying in their own right absent evidence of any\nincidents during those trips that raise her vulnerability to exploitation, pressure or coercion (see \u00b6\n7(i) ( conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable\nto exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country)). Routine\nchecks and registration with authorities are not sufficient to apply DC \u00b6 7(i), but the trips are relevant\nin that they demonstrate Applicant\u2019s bond with her parents and siblings. Similarly, Applicant\u2019s\nvoluntary financial support for her parents at $400 per month is not a financial interest within the\nmeaning of DC \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country,\nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to\nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation). Rather it shows that Applicant has a strong\nsense of personal obligation to care for her parents. While this is certainly commendable, it heightens\nthe risk.\nApplicant does not share the same close personal relationship with extended family living\nin Lebanon (uncles, aunt, cousins). She has in-person contact with them at most once a year and only\nif they happen to come by when she is at her parents\u2019 home. Mitigating conditions (MC) \u00b6 8(a) ( the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interest of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) and \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with\nforeign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation) apply in mitigation of her contacts with extended family members.\nHowever, her frequent contact with her parents and siblings precludes favorable\nconsideration of \u00b6 8(c) relative to her immediate family. The familial bonds are too strong to satisfy\nthe first prong of \u00b6 8(a). Furthermore, Lebanon, while not known to target U.S. citizens to obtain\nprotected information, is associated with a risk of terrorism. U.S. State Department publications\nchronicle the history of instability in Lebanon, and the continuing influence of Syria, which is a state\nsponsor of terrorism. Although Syria withdrew its troops under international pressure in 2005, covert\nintelligence assets remain. Moreover, as recently as November 2006, pro-Syrian forces, led by\nHizballah, began months of massive demonstrations and occasional violence with the aim of\nbringing down Lebanon\u2019s democratically-elected government. Efforts to undermine Lebanese\nsovereignty create an unstable political climate that heightens the risk. Lebanon remains a very\ndangerous place for its citizens and visitors alike, leading the U.S. State Department in June 2007\nto warn against travel to Lebanon. When Applicant and her spouse were in Lebanon in December\n2006, they were prevented from traveling into Beirut, although they observed no violence or\ndemonstrations in her parents\u2019 immediate vicinity.\nApplicant argues for a distinction between the risk to physical security that exists in an\nunstable environment, and the types of concern that rise to the level of compromising Applicant\u2019s\n\n10\nability to safeguard national security. Applicant\u2019s position makes sense only if terrorism is viewed\nsolely as a criminal activity. Terrorism is not limited to indiscriminate acts of violence intended to\nincite fear. It often has political aims, and where it is allowed to operate unchecked or is condoned\none has to question the ability and/or willingness of a government to protect its citizens against\ninterference, coercion, or other abuses. Under Guideline B, the risk of terrorism within a foreign\ncountry is a relevant consideration independent of whether the foreign country is known to target\nU.S. citizens to obtain protected information. The DOHA Appeal Board recently found error in a\nDOHA administrative judge\u2019s failure to consider in depth the substantial impact of terrorist\norganizations operating within Lebanon. (See ISCR Case No. 05-11292, Apr. 12, 2007).\nApplicant\u2019s parents are retired and her sisters are in the education field. There is nothing\nabout their particular occupational endeavors that suggests military, intelligence, or security\nresponsibilities. It is noted that sister #3 was twice denied a visa to visit her in the U.S. While there\nis nothing to contradict Applicant\u2019s testimony that it only was because her sister is single and owns\nno property, the denial of a visa raises questions about this particular sister\u2019s situation, activities,\nand/or associations about which little is known. Despite State Department warnings, Applicant\ncontinues to travel to Lebanon to visit her family members. She is hoping to go to Lebanon with her\nspouse in December 2007, but is waiting to make travel arrangements until one month before her\nintended departure so that she does not lose money if she has to cancel the trip due to an outbreak\nof hostilities. Less of a risk is associated with Applicant\u2019s brother in the U.A.E. given that country\u2019s\nrelative stability and cooperation in fighting terrorism, although concerns persist because of his\nLebanese citizenship and the strong family bonds to those in Lebanon. MC \u00b6 8(a) does not apply in\nmitigation of the strong bonds to her immediate family members abroad.\nThe risk of undue foreign influence presented by Applicant\u2019s affections for her family\nmembers may yet be mitigated by countervailing strong ties in the U.S. (See MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in the U.S.)). Since immigrating to the U.S. in late December 1996, Applicant\nhas established connections to the U.S. that weigh in her favor in assessing whether she is likely to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. Her spouse and daughter are U.S. native-born\ncitizens. All of her financial assets are in the U.S. (employment, home ownership, 401K and other\nretirement assets). She has developed close friendships here, and three of her siblings are U.S.\nresident citizens. She voluntarily acquired U.S. citizenship in August 2003. Yet, even with these very\nsignificant ties are relatively recent, and she has a strong desire to retain her connection through\ncitizenship to her native Lebanon.\nApplicant submits that she would immediately report any attempt at improper influence to\nher facility security officer. A statement of intention about what an applicant will do in the future\nunder some hypothetical set of circumstances is not entitled to much weight, unless there is record\nevidence that the applicant has acted in an identical or similar manner in the past under identical or\nsimilar circumstances. See ISCR Case No. 99-0511 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2000); ISCR Case No. 01-\n26893 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). Applicant is reputed among her friends and coworkers to hold high\nethical and moral principles, but it is not enough to mitigate the security significant foreign influence\nconcerns that exist. \n \n\n11\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9). A native of Lebanon, Applicant came to the\nU.S. after having just married a naturalized U.S. citizen who had immigrated from Lebanon. When\nthe marriage failed, Applicant remained in the U.S. for the job opportunities and because she had the\nsupport of three siblings, who were already living here.  In August 2002, she married a native U.S.\ncitizen, and one year later became a U.S. citizen herself. In September 2003 and again in July 2004,\nApplicant used her Lebanese passport to travel to Lebanon to see her parents and sisters, even though\nshe was traveling with her spouse, who held only a U.S. passport. Her active exercise of her foreign\ncitizenship bears serious foreign preference concerns under disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 10(a)(1)\n(exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a\ncurrent foreign passport). As someone who embraces her dual citizenship, it is simply not believable\nthat she used her Lebanese passport solely to avoid a $20 visa fee that she could easily afford (see\nTr. 159, 175).\nApplicant surrendered her Lebanese passport to the Lebanese Consulate in February 2006\nfollowing her interview with a government investigator. Mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 11(e) (the\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated) applies. She is unwilling to renounce her Lebanese citizenship unless required to do so,\neven if it cost her a clearance. She testified it is because of some benefit of that citizenship (such as\nreduced property taxes) that she might enjoy on her retirement, but it is more likely her emotional\nand familial ties to Lebanon (see Guideline B) that lead her to maintain her Lebanese citizenship.\nRenunciation of foreign citizenship is a mitigating condition (see MC \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship)), but it is not required. Applicant has\ndemonstrated her willingness to comply with DoD requirements by surrendering her Lebanese\npassport as soon as she became aware of the security concerns raised by the use of that passport.\nAlthough she is eligible to reacquire a Lebanese passport, she testified credibly that she has no intent\nto obtain a Lebanese passport in the future.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant\nhas a record of dedicated contributions to her employer and several witnesses consider her capable\nof fulfilling the day-to-day fiduciary obligations of a clearance. However, this is not enough to meet\nher heavy burden of overcoming the foreign influence concerns. Not enough is known about her\nsiblings\u2019 associates and activities in Lebanon. Those coworkers attesting to her security suitability\nknow little of her family in Lebanon. The coworker who has known Applicant since 1997 was made\naware of her travels to Lebanon only from reading the SOR. Moreover, she plans to continue to\ntravel to Lebanon. Should her parents and sister #3 gain U.S. permanent residency and immigrate\nto the U.S., it could reduce significantly the security risk. However, as the situation now stands, I am\nunable to make the affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nher access to classified information.\n\n12\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

(Items 4,\n7)\n$21,628\nTotal debt listed in SOR\nPOLICIES\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, dated August 2006, sets forth Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating\nConditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here are Guideline F, financial considerations.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\n\n5\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her\nfinances so as to meet her financial obligations.\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nApplicant owes approximately $21,600 on 14 delinquent debts.  Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d apply. \nIn April 2006, Applicant\u2019s Federal income tax refund was intercepted to pay a debt to the\nmilitary exchange service and she settled a credit card debt. However, neither of these debts were\nlisted in the SOR.  Of the unpaid delinquent accounts, not all of the debts are large debts. More than\nhalf the debts are approximately $400 or less. There is no documentation that any of the debts listed\nin the SOR have been paid.  \nMitigating Condition (MC) 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances,\u201d has very limited applicability.  Applicant asserts her separation from the Army\ncontributed to her inability to fulfill her financial obligations. Additionally, she separated from her\npartner who failed to help pay the joint debts. The impact of these events on her finances is not\nfurther described. Applicant has failed to explain how the events caused the financial problems.\nWithout additional information, it is impossible to find that the events caused the debts or that\nApplicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \nOnly two of the debts in question are related to medical bills (SOR 1.c $205 and SOR 1.k\n$316).  These two medical debts do not establish Applicant\u2019s financial problem was caused by\nunexpected medical emergency. \n\n6\n Applicant has sought financial counseling to qualify for bankruptcy. She asserts she will file\nfor bankruptcy when she has sufficient funds to pay the expense of bankruptcy. She has not\ndemonstrated a positive change in her financial management. The debts remain unpaid. There is no\nindication the problem is being resolved or under control.  MC 2(c) \u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control,\u201d does not apply. \nMC 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,\u201d applies. For MC 20(d) to apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the\n\u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of\nhandling her debts is needed, which is not present here. Applicant asserts she has entered into a\nrepayment agreement with some of the creditors.  She failed to document the agreements. She has\nprovided nothing to substantiate her claim of a repayment agreement. She has not provided a plan\nfor paying her delinquent obligations.  \nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future. I find against Applicant as to financial considerations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\n\n7\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nClaude R.

Applicant is a 51-year-old inside plant technician/telecommunications specialist (Tr. 42) who has worked for a defense contractor since October 2005. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance. In September 2004, Applicant and his wife decided to move to a different city to be close to their daughter, who was in medical school, and their grandchildren. Applicant took an early retirement after 31 years with his company and his wife left her job and cashed out her retirement. They then sold their home, relocated, and purchased a home.

The\nrecord was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents, which were received on\nAugust 6, 2007. Department Counsel having no objections, the documents were admitted into\nevidence. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns for financial considerations. Applicant is a 51-year-old\ninside plant technician/telecommunications specialist (Tr. 42) who has worked for a defense\ncontractor since October 2005.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance. \nIn September 2004, Applicant and his wife decided to move to a different city to be close\nto their daughter, who was in medical school, and their grandchildren. Applicant took an early\nretirement after 31 years with his company and his wife left her job and cashed out her retirement.\nThey then sold their home, relocated, and purchased a home. Following the relocation, it took a\nwhile to find new employment. Applicant used the money from the sale of the house and from his\nIndividual Retirement Account (IRA) for living expenses and to purchase the new home. (Tr. 49)\nBecause Applicant was not yet 59\u00bd years old he incurred a 10% penalty in addition to the IRA funds\nused were treated as ordinary income. A $125,000 tax debt was incurred to the IRS.  In July 2006,\nthis debt was paid. \nAdditionally, in 2005, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law became sick and then died, which added to\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems. Applicant had two children in college. In June 2005, he obtained\na job as a security guard. Applicant explored the possibility of bankruptcy with an attorney.  He then\ntook an online counseling session which helped him review his money management and past bad\nhabits. (Tr. 54) \nApplicant initially had difficulty contacting the holders of the debts because the debts had\nbeen sold to other collection agencies. (Tr. 28) It took him approximately a year to locate the current\ndebt holders. In January 2007, the collection agency for a credit card debt (SOR 1.a, $11,171)\noffered to settle the account for $8,853. (Gov Ex 2) In July 2007, Applicant made a $1,164 payment\non this debt and arranged with the creditor to make monthly payments of $218 for 48 months. (App\nEx A) \n\n3\nApplicant owed another credit card company $11,635 (SOR 1.b).  In May 2007, June 2007,\nand July 2007, Applicant made $250 monthly payments on this debt. (App Exs B and G)\nApplicant owed $12,004 on a third debt (SOR 1.c) The collection company holding the\nobligation has agreed to accept monthly payments of $630 on this debt. (App Ex C). Applicant made\npayments in June 2007 and July 2007.  In March 2007, the collection company was willing to take\na $4,965 lump-sum payment to settle the debt in full. \nThe fair market value of Applicant\u2019s home is $250,000 on which$180,000 is owed. In\nAugust 2006, Applicant obtained a $135,000 home equity loan. (Tr. 47) The IRS was paid $125,000\nand the lending institution required the note on Applicant\u2019s 2004 Honda be paid, which was the\nadditional $10,000 of the equity loan. (Tr. 27) Applicant pays $1,000 per month on a 30-year home\nequity mortgage loan at 8% interest. \nIn April 2007, Applicant sought an additional equity loan with the same company for\napproximately $30,000 to pay the three debts listed in the SOR. He has been approved for another\nequity loan at 8.25 % (Tr. 47), however, state law requires a one year period between refinancing.\n(App Ex D) In August 2007, the one year waiting period will end and Applicant\u2019s is free to refinance\nthe home. Applicant\u2019s monthly payments would then be $1,500.\nApplicant has no car loan payments.  He is current on his two credit cards on which he owes\napproximately $1,600. (Tr. 41) Applicant currently makes approximately $46,500 a year. (Tr. 52)\nApplicant\u2019s wife currently babysits the two grandchildren while her daughter attends medical\nschool. Applicant acknowledges he should have obtained the assistance of a financial manager when\nhe took early retirement, sold his home, and purchased his current home. Applicant is living within\nhis means and is not being contacted by creditors. Applicant uses on-line banking to track his\nexpenses. (Tr. 60) \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F, financial considerations.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n4\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his\nfinances so as to meet his financial obligations.\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nApplicant owes approximately $30,000 on three debts.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply. \nMitigating Conditions (MC) 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, applies. There are only three\n\n5\ndebts and the events leading to the debts are unlikely to recur. The large tax bill was the result of\ncashing out a retirement program and selling a home. Applicant has no retirement program to cash\nout.  Since relocating and purchasing his home, Applicant is unlikely to change houses in the future.\nApplicant\u2019s 2004 car is paid for and is not likely to need replacing in the near future. \nI find MC 20 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, has\nsome applicability.  Applicant took an early retirement and his wife cashed out her retirement\nprogram.  These are not unforseen events, but the tax ramifications were. Applicant, acting without\nthe advice of a financial advisor, incurred a sizable tax debt. This has been paid though a home\nequity loan. Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances.\n Applicant sought financial counseling and has demonstrated a change in his financial\nmanagement.  There is a clear indication the problem is being resolved or under control.  MC 20 (c)\nthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control, applies as does MC 20 (d) the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  For MC 20 (d) to apply\nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and evidence of a good-faith\neffort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling his debts is needed, which is present\nhere. \nApplicant has made three payments on the first debt.  He paid $1,164 and is now making\nmonthly payments of $218. On the second debt he has made three monthly payments of $250 each.\nOn the third debt he has made two monthly payments of $630 each. When the one year bar\nprohibiting refinancing his home is over, Applicant anticipates obtaining a home equity loan to pay\noff the three debts listed in the SOR.  The loan has already been approved, is with the same lender,\nraises his interest rate a quarter of a percent, and raises his monthly payment by $500. Applicant has\nno car loan and owes only $1,600 on two credit cards.  Applicant can afford the additional $500 per\nmonth in loan payment.  If the equity loan does not go through, Applicant will continue making his\n$1,100 monthly payments on the three debts.  Applicant has made sufficient payments to show that\nhe will continue making his payments.\nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future.  I find for Applicant as to financial considerations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT\n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

He\ncompleted his education in the United States, married, and became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in 1995. Applicant\u2019s ties of affection and/or obligation and contacts with his\nelderly parents and six siblings, who are citizen residents of Iran, pose an\nunacceptable risk or concern. His favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate\nthe foreign influence and preference security concerns. Clearance is denied.\n\n  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified In form ation Within Industry (Feb. 20,\n1\n1960, as amended, and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992) (Directive), as amended, modified, and\nrevised. \n  Additionally, E xhibits (Ex.) 1 through 10 (U.S. Dept. of State documents concerning Iran),\n2\nwere marked for identification and considered for administrative notice only.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 1, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), alleging facts that raise security\nconcerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference). The SOR informed Applicant that based on information available to the\nGovernment, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified\ninformation.  On March 2, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer), and\n1\nrequested a decision based on the record.  On March 23, 2007, the government\nrequested a hearing pursuant to \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.7 of the Additional Procedural Guidance of\nEnclosure (3) of DoD Directive 5220.6. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 11, 2007. On May 22, 2007, I convened\na hearing at which the government presented five exhibits, marked GE 1 through 5,\nto support the SOR.  Applicant testified on his own behalf, and did not present any\n2\nexhibits nor call any witnesses.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 31,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. His\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all\nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 55 years old and has been married to his second wife since\nDecember 1997. His second wife is Iranian born and is a U.S citizen.  They have two\nU.S. born daughters, ages six and four. He was previously married to his first wife, a\nU.S.born citizen, from August 1986 to November 1991.  That marriage ended by\ndivorce.    \nApplicant was born in Iran and immigrated to the U.S. in January 1977 on a\nstudent visa at age 25. He was awarded a bachelor of science degree in computer\nscience in May 1980 and awarded a master\u2019s degree in mathematics in December\n1982. He became a naturalized U. S. citizen in 1995, and received his U. S. passport\nin 1995.  \nApplicant has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, as a\ncomputer specialist, since October 1999. He is a first time applicant for a security\nclearance and desires a clearance to enhance his upward mobility within his\ncompany. \n\n  The facts in the next two paragraphs were obtained from U.S. Dept. of State documents concerning Iran\n3\nin Ex. 2 through Ex. 10.\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizen residents of Iran.  His father is 87 years old\nand his mother is 79 years old.  Both his parents are in poor health.  His father is a\nretired shoemaker and his mother is a housewife.  Applicant has six siblings who are\ncitizen residents of Iran, and he also has two siblings who reside in the U.S. \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are also citizen residents of Iran.  Applicant has one\nbrother-in-law living in the U.S., and one brother-in-law and one sister-in-law who\nare citizen residents of Iran.  Tr.26.  \nApplicant telephones his parents \u201cabout once a month.\u201d  If he speaks to his\nsiblings, it is more likely one or more of them happens to be at his parents home\nwhen he calls.  Tr. 28.  Applicant testified he is close to his family in Iran.  Tr. 28.\nApplicant\u2019s wife telephones her parents \u201conce a month\u201d and he is not usually home\nwhen she calls them.  Tr. 26-27.  Applicant testified his wife is close to her parents\nand two siblings in Iran. Tr. 27.  \nApplicant held an Iranian passport issued to him in June 1976, which expired\nin February 2006.  He initially stated that he was holding his Iranian passport with\nthe intent to renew it should an emergency arise with his parents in Iran.  Answer. He\nlater testified he was \u201cnot sure at this point\u201dwhen asked if he intended to renew his\nIranian passport.  Tr. 18-19.  He later added that if he received word his parents\nbecame ill, he would have to renew his Iranian passport if he were to travel to see his\nparents in Iran.  \nApplicant traveled to Iran in March 1996 when he received word his father\nwas having a pacemaker operation.  Tr. 19.  Applicant testified that given his dual\ncitizenship status, he must use an Iranian passport.  Tr. 20-21.  None of Applicant\u2019s\nfamily members living in Iran work for the Iranian government.  Tr. 23-24.\nApplicant owns a home in the U.S., conducts all his banking in the U.S., and\nvotes in U.S. elections.  He does not own any real or personal property in Iran.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The United States has not\nhad diplomatic relations with Iran since April 7, 1980.  Iran is a theocratic Islamic\n3\nrepublic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures. Iran\nengages in clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction (WMD), sponsors international terrorism, intervenes in the internal\naffairs of Iraq, undermines the Middle East peace process, and violates the human\nrights of the Iranian people. The United States and its allies are attempting to block\nIran\u2019s goals of obtaining nuclear weapons and other WMD and to counter Iran\u2019s\nefforts to destabilize Iraq and other the Middle East countries.  \nThe United States has designated Iran as the most active state sponsor of\nterrorism. The United States is concerned about the possibility that Iran could\ntransfer WMD to terrorists. Iran supports terrorists who attack Israel and Shiite\nmilitias who pursue sectarian violence in Iraq. Iranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens\nare warned to carefully consider the risks of travel to Iran because they are still\nconsidered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities. Iran does not recognize dual\n\n  Directive, Section 6.3. states, \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common\n4\nsense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the\npertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2 . . .\u201d\n  Directive, \u00b6 2(a). states, \u201c. . .

The Iranian government has harassed and detained dual citizens of the\nUnited States and Iran.      \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost\nare the Disqualifying and Mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline\napplicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. However, the guidelines are\nnot viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or\nagainst an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common\nsense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the\n4\nwhole person concept.  Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude\n5\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline C (Foreign Preference) are the applicable\nrelevant adjudicative guidelines.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the initial burden of proving\n6\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must\nestablish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.  The responsibility then shifts\n7\nto the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of\npersuasion.  \n8\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\n\n  See Id; Directive Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App.\n1 0\nBd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.9\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this\nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance,\nloyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the government\u2019s concern is that\n\u201cforeign contacts and interest may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or she] may be manipulated or induced to\nhelp a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but\nnot limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk\nof terrorism.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 6.\nGuideline \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case, including:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s\nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information;\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is\nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one\nrelative lives in a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative,\nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could\npotentially result in the compromise of classified information.  Applicant has\n10\nfrequent contacts (at least once a month) and a close relationship with his father,\nwho is a resident and citizen of Iran. These contacts create a heightened risk of\nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is the possibility that\n\n  The focus is not the country or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the government they\n1 1\nimpose. This approach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each country in accordance with the level\nof security concern or threat it presents to the United States. \nIranian agents may exploit the opportunity to obtain intelligence, classified, or\neconomic information about the United States. His connection to his parents, and to\na lesser extent his siblings and in-laws, also create a potential conflict of interest\nbecause his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his\ndesire to help family members or the government of Iran by providing sensitive or\nclassified information. \nThe Government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a\nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government.\nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are\npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense\nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest; and\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation.\nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s\ncase, I conclude that none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has feelings\nof affection and/or obligation for his parents and six remaining sibling in Iran. The\ncloseness of the relationship is demonstrated by Applicant\u2019s telephone contacts to\nhis parents, and his visit to Iran in 1996. \nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be\nexploited, I considered Iran\u2019s form of government;  Iran and the United States have\n11\nnot had diplomatic relations since 1980; Iran is the most active state sponsor of\nterrorism; Iran\u2019s clandestine effort to acquire weapons of mass destruction; Iran\u2019s\naggressive efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process; and its intervention\ninto the internal affairs of Iraq. I also considered the government of Iran\u2019s dismal\n\nhuman rights record and serious human rights abuses. The security concerns raised\nby Iran are heightened because of Iran\u2019s hostile stance toward the United States, and\nits blatant support of terrorism. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in his case, Applicant did not\nestablish it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between\nthe interests of his family and the interests of the U.S. His frequent contacts and\nclose relationship with his parents and siblings could potentially force him to\nchoose between the United States and Iran. He did not meet his burden of showing\nthere is little likelihood that his relationship with his family could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation.\nGuideline \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has developed a\nsufficient relationship and loyalty to the U.S., that he can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. He has lived in the United\nStates since he was 25 years old. He was educated in the United States, and became\na U.S. citizen in 1995. His wife and two U.S. born children are citizen residents of\nthe United States. All of his financial investments and business are in the United\nStates. His contacts and linkage to the United States are greater than his linkage to\nIran. Although this mitigating condition is partially applicable, these facts are\ninsufficient to overcome the security concerns.\nUnder Guideline C (Foreign Preference), the government\u2019s concern is that\n\u201cwhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information\nor make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  Guideline\n\u00b6 10.\nGuideline \u00b6 10 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying in this case, including:\n(A) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\nThis includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\nThe Government produced substantial evidence raising one potentially\ndisqualifying condition, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  As previously indicated, the burden of disproving\na mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.  \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s Iranian passport has expired, it is clear from his\ntestimony he wishes to keep his options open to renew it should the need arise to\nvisit his aging parents in Iran.  As such, I am unable to apply any mitigating\nconditions.\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as\ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to\n\n ISCR Case No. 0 3-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at\n1 2\n4 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003).\n  See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \"a very heavy burden\n13\nof persuasion to overcome the security concerns\" when parents and siblings live in Iran); ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at\n4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \"very heavy burden\" standard when applicant's family members live in Iran).\n  Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990).\n1 4\nth\nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person\nconcept, the Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an\napplicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances.\u201d  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors\n12\n(factors) which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. Additionally, other\n\u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.\nUltimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.3.    \nApplicant\u2019s mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of his security\nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for 30 years, and is a naturalized\nU.S. citizen. His testimony shows he is a loyal U.S. citizen. His wife is also a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen and his two children are U.S. born citizens. His ties to the\nUnited States are stronger than his ties to family members in Iran. There is no\nevidence he has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the\nUnited States. He takes his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and he has\nworked diligently for his current defense contractor employer for over seven years.\nHe was candid and respectful in his remarks, and he appears to be an individual who\nis conscientious, responsible, mature, and of high integrity. \nNotwithstanding his favorable information, the heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation remains. Applicants with immediate family members living in Iran have\na \"very heavy burden of persuasion\" to demonstrate that their contacts with those\nfamily members do not pose a security risk.13\n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong\npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .\nit is deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in\nsecurity by denying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d  After weighing the disqualifying\n14\nand mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the\nwhole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the foreign influence security\nconcerns. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n        Subparagraphs 1.a. - 2.b.:\n           Against Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 4, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline C and under SOR paragraphs 2(d), 2 (r) and 2(s) is not at issue\n1\nin this appeal. \nThe Board construes the Judge\u2019s decision as concluding that Applicant\u2019s ties to the country he works in are\n2\nnot of security concern.\n2\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 20, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nfiled a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \n1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings were\nsupported by substantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is\nsustainable.  We remand the case to the Judge for the issuance of a new decision. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following sustainable findings of fact: Applicant works for a defense\ncontractor abroad.  He was born and raised in Ecuador and became a U.S. citizen in the early 2000s.\nHis wife is a citizen of Ecuador and currently resides with him in another country.  He has children\nwho are Ecuadorian citizens or U.S. citizens or duel citizens of those countries.  Those children\nreside with their parents.  \nApplicant has immediate family members and in-laws who are citizens and residents of\nEcuador.  He has an in-law who is a member of the Ecuadorian military.  He also has a friend who\nis a member of the Ecuadorian military.  They contact each other by e-mail approximately once every\nthree months.  He has a number of uncles and aunts who are citizens and residents of Ecuador.\nApplicant and/or his wife own real estate in the country he works and have bank accounts\nin that country and in Ecuador.  Applicant\u2019s financial ties in the country he works are due only to the\nfact that he works there.  He has substantial financial ties or property in the U.S. \nEcuador is a constitutional republic that respects human rights and maintains close ties with\nthe United States.2\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n\n3\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nAs stated above, Applicant contends that certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are not based\nupon substantial record evidence.  Having reviewed the record as a whole, the Board resolves this\nissue adversely to Applicant.  To the extent that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contain error, it is\nharmless.  See ISCR Case No. 01-23362 at  (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006).\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn analyzing Applicant\u2019s case, the Judge took into account his ties to the United States and\nother matters Applicant submitted in his own behalf but concluded that, given Applicant\u2019s extensive\nfamily ties to Ecuador, his connection to members of the Ecuadorian military, and the dangers\ninherent in the region, Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  After\n\nApplicant Exhibit (AE) 1at 3.  (Letter from Program Manager, dated Oct. 12, 2007.)  \n3\nAE 1 at 5.  \n4\nAE 1 at 7. \n5\n4\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s analysis in that regard did not adequately\ndiscuss significant mitigating evidence, in light of prior precedents and Applicant\u2019s burden of\npersuasion in the case.  \nAs a general rule, an applicant\u2019s prior history of complying with security procedures and\nregulations is considered to be of relatively low probative value for the purposes of refuting,\nmitigating, or extenuating the security concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate\ndisqualifying conduct or circumstances.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13,\n2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. May 30, 2006).  However, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in\nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, independent evidence that his\ncompliance with security procedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk\ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national security.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6\n(App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).  The presence of\nsuch circumstances can give credibility to an applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to\nrecognize, resist, and report attempts at coercion or exploitation.  Id.\nHere, the record contained statements from several officials of another government agency\nreferencing the significant and dangerous work done on behalf of the U.S. by Applicant.  One\nstatement commended Applicant for his work  \u201cin a position of trust while performing critical\ncounter . . . operations in . . .\u201d   Another, stated that Applicant \u201chas demonstrated unswerving\n3\ndedication to . . . the mission of [the other government agency] and the United States . . . in the war\non . . . [Applicant] literally make[s] life and death decisions [during every mission].\u201d   Yet another\n4\ncommends Applicant for serving the U.S. at the risk of his own personal safety.   Those statements\n5\nare consistent with the Judge\u2019s findings about the danger posed to American citizens abroad.  They\ndemonstrate that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to assume a high level of risk on behalf of\nthe U.S., and they constitute important evidence that Applicant\u2019s ties and sense of obligation to the\nU.S. could be sufficiently strong that he \u201c[could] be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. . .\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.8(b).  See ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14,\n2006.)

Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 (App. Bd. Feb.\n5, 2008).\nAccordingly, the case is remanded to the Judge for the issuance of a new decision which\ndiscusses whether or not  Applicant\u2019s circumstances fall within the above precedents, and if so, to\nwhat extent.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 4, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The SOR \ninformed Applicant that based on available information, DOHA adjudicators could not \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him access to classified information and submitted the case to an \nadministrative judge for a security determination.1 On June 21, 2007, Applicant \nanswered the SOR and requested a hearing. \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nJune 16, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nThe case was assigned to me on September 4, 2007. Applicant is a resident of \nthe Republic of Colombia (Colombia). On or about September 11, 2007, Applicant \nelected to have his hearing conducted via video tele-conference (VTC). On September \n21, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued convening a VTC hearing on October 10, \n2007. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The government presented two \nexhibits, marked GE 1 and 2, to support the SOR. At his hearing, Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf and presented no witnesses or exhibits. I allowed Applicant additional \ntime to present post-hearing submissions. He availed himself of the opportunity and \nsubmitted one exhibit, marked AE 1. DOHA received the transcript on October 18, \n2007. I issued a decision denying a clearance on November 20, 2007. \n \nAPPELLATE LITIGATION \n \n \nApplicant appealed my decision to deny his clearance. On April 9, 2008, the \nAppeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case for a new decision.2 In his appeal, Applicant \nchallenged some of my findings of facts contending they were not based upon \nsubstantial evidence. After reviewing the record as a whole, the Appeal Board resolved \nthe issue against Applicant indicating that \u201cto the extent that the Judge\u2019s findings for fact \ncontain error, it is harmless.\u201d3 I will not restate in this decision the facts in the same \ndetail as they were covered in my first decision. \n \n \nThe Appeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case for the issuance of a new decision \nwhich discusses whether or not Applicant\u2019s circumstances fall within precedent \nestablished by certain Appeal Board cases, and if so, to what extent. The Appeal Board \nhas stated that: \n \nAs a general rule, an applicant\u2019s prior history of complying with security \nprocedures and regulations is considered to be of relatively low probative \nvalue for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the security \nconcerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying conduct \nor circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. \n13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR \nCase No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). However, the Board \nhas recognized an exception to that general rule in Guideline B cases, \nwhere the applicant has established by credible, independent evidence \nthat his compliance with security procedures and regulations occurred in \nthe context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant \nhad made a significant contribution to the national security. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. \n05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd.

Apr. 9, 2008). \n\n \n3 \n \n \n(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). The presence of such circumstances can give \ncredibility to an applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to \nrecognize, resist, and report attempts at coercion or exploitation. Id. \n \nWhen an \u201cApplicant has repeatedly been willing to assume a high level of \nrisk on behalf of the U.S., [his behavior] constitute[s] important evidence \nthat Applicant\u2019s ties and sense of obligation to the U.S. could be \nsufficiently strong that he \u201c[could] be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. .\u201c Directive \u00b6 E2.8(b). See ISCR Case No. 05-\n03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006.) (Applicant\u2019s work as an interpreter in \nAfghanistan \noccurred \n\u201cin \nthe \ncontext \nof \ndangerous, \nhigh-risk \ncircumstances in which [he] made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 07-00034 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). \n \nISCR Case No. 06-25928 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2008) (footnotes omitted). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of facts. After a thorough review of Applicant\u2019s testimony and the \nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings of facts. \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a U.S. defense contractor providing \nsupport for a U.S. agency in Columbia. He was born, raised, and educated in Ecuador. \nHe served approximately six years in the Ecuadorian military forces where he received \nthe equivalent of a college education.  \n \n \nAt age 25, Applicant studied in the United States for approximately one year \nunder a student visa (Tr. 40). From around 1989 to 1991, he lived in Ecuador and \nworked for several Ecuadorian companies. His job allowed him to travel frequently to \nthe United States. In the early 1990s, he moved to the United States to attend further \neducation/training and to work for several U.S. companies. In September 2001, \nApplicant was undergoing training while working in the United States and was \nfurloughed along with 3,000 other employees across the United States. Between 2001 \nand 2003, he was forced to take other jobs to make ends meet. In 2003, he was hired \nby his current employer, a defense contractor, to provide services to a U.S. agency in \nColombia. He moved his wife and three children to Colombia to be close to them. \n \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2003, and was issued \nhis U.S. passport that same month. His wife is a citizen of Ecuador, a registered legal \nalien in the United States, and currently a resident of Colombia. He has one step-child \nborn in Ecuador, who is a U.S. resident alien. Another child is a dual citizen of Ecuador \nand the United States, and the third child was born in the United States. Applicant and \nhis wife have bank accounts in Ecuador and Colombia to pay for their day-to-day living \nexpenses while they are living in one of these countries. They have approximately \n\n \n4 \n \n \n$4,000 in a savings account in Colombia. They also have a $1,000 savings account in \nEcuador, and his wife has a certificate of deposit for $10,000, resulting from the sale of \nher automobile (Tr. 34). \n \n \nApplicant moved his family from the United States to Colombia because of his \njob for a defense contractor. Applicant bought a small apartment in Colombia with a \nvalue of approximately $150,000. Applicant and his wife do not consider Colombia their \nhome. They reside in Colombia only because of his job. They intend to sell all their \nproperty in Colombia when he gets recalled to work for his prior U.S. employer. When \nthat happens, he intends to return to live in the United States and to retire in the United \nStates (Tr. 96). Applicant owns a condominium in the United States with an approximate \nvalue of $300,000. Additionally, he has approximately $9,000 invested in stocks in the \nUnited States (Tr. 83).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, most of his extended family members, his wife\u2019s parents, \nand her extended family members are citizens and residents of Ecuador. His father \nretired after 21 years working for a U.S. agency doing business in Ecuador (Tr. 38). He \ncurrently works for several U.S. private companies doing business in Ecuador, and as a \nconsultant. His father inculcated in Applicant the idea of coming to live in the United \nStates and becoming a U.S. citizen (Tr. 37-38).  \n \n \nHis father would like to live in the United States (Tr. 57). His mother is a \nhomemaker. Applicant contacts his parents once a week via the Internet. His parents \nvisited Applicant in Colombia in 2005. At least once a year since he left Ecuador, \nApplicant and his family have traveled to Ecuador to visit their family members during \nvacations, holidays and on special occasions. They allot their time in Ecuador visiting \ntheir respective family members and friends. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister is a clothing high fashion designer. She is married to an \nEcuadorian senior military officer who was Applicant\u2019s classmate. The senior military \nofficer has sensitive responsibilities in Ecuador (Tr. 59, 94). Applicant has contact with \nhis sister and her family whenever he travels to Ecuador, at least two to three times a \nyear, during holidays, birthdays, and special occasions (Tr. 61). His last visit was during \nthe 2006 Christmas holidays (Tr. 60). Applicant and his wife contact her family at least \ntwice a month, as well as during their trips to Ecuador, and during holidays, birthdays, \nand special occasions (Tr. 62). \n \n \nOn his father\u2019s side, Applicant has 11 uncles and aunts; on his mother\u2019s side he \nhas three uncles and aunts. One of his uncles is a U.S. citizen, and another is a U.S. \nlegal resident. His remaining relatives are all citizens and residents of Ecuador. To \nApplicant\u2019s knowledge, none of his uncles or aunts works or has worked for the \nEcuadorian government. Applicant keeps in contact with a friend who is a senior field \ngrade officer in the Ecuadorian military. They keep contact with each other via e-mail \napproximately once every three months. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \n \nIn 2005, when Applicant submitted his security clearance application, he \ndisclosed he was in possession of a valid Ecuadorian passport. He used his Ecuadorian \npassport, in preference to his U.S. passport, to travel to Ecuador in December 2003 and \nJune 2004. He was made aware of the security clearance concerns raised by his \npossession and use of an Ecuadorian passport. He promised his agency\u2019s regional \nsecurity officer he would not use his Ecuadorian passport again, and volunteered to \nsurrender it and to renounce his citizenship, if necessary (Tr. 48, 98). Applicant was in \npossession of a valid Ecuadorian passport the day of his hearing. He volunteered to \nsurrender his Ecuadorian passport at any time he was asked to do so (Tr. 51). There is \nno evidence he used his Ecuadorian passport after he was informed of the security \nconcerns raised by it in 2005. At his hearing, Applicant reiterated his willingness to \nsurrender the passport and to renounce his Ecuadorian citizenship. On October 22, \n2007, Applicant surrendered his Ecuadorian passport to his company\u2019s facility security \nofficer for safekeeping (AE 1).2 \n \n \nApplicant introduced statements from a supervisor and two U.S. government \nagency officials attesting to the significant and dangerous work Applicant has done on \nbehalf of the United States. His program manager, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, \nmanages a substantial contract for a government agency involved in sensitive \noperations. He closely supervised Applicant for approximately four years. He considers \nApplicant a highly skilled employee who has consistently performed in an outstanding \nmanner. Applicant earned his manager\u2019s trust and respect because of his character and \nhighly ethical conduct. Applicant worked in a position of trust while performing critical \noperations that required the handling of classified information. His manager endorses \nApplicant\u2019s clearance without hesitation.4 \n \n \nThe first of the other two character references worked for a U.S. state police \ndepartment for eight years, and has been working for a government agency for 10 \nyears. He has known Applicant for approximately two years. He is impressed by \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, professionalism, and skills. Applicant has demonstrated \nunswerving dedication to the mission of the government agency and the United States. \nHe commended Applicant for his judgment while literally making life and death decision \nduring every mission.5  \n \n \nThe third reference is a retired U.S. Navy Senior Chief, currently working for a \ngovernment agency. He has known Applicant for approximately one year. He believes \nApplicant has unquestionable dedication to the United States and its mission. He \nconsiders Applicant to be completely trustworthy and a valued friend. Moreover, he \n \n2 I left the record open to allow Applicant additional time to submit information for my \nconsideration. He submitted statements from three character references and a letter from his company\u2019s \nfacility security officer. Department Counsel did not object to me considering any of the documents. I \nmarked Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding memorandum, as well as the documents submitted as AE 1, \nand admitted them into the record. \n4  AE 1 at 3. \n \n5  AE 1 at 5. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \ncommended Applicant for serving the United States at the risk of his own personal \nsafety.6 All of them consider Applicant a dedicated family man. \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Ecuador is a constitutional \nrepublic with a democratically elected government. The government generally respects \nthe human rights of its citizens. However, the country continues to experience serious \nhuman rights problems including improper conduct by security forces, criminal activity in \nthe National Police, corruption and denial of due process in the judicial system. The \nUnited States and Ecuador have maintained close ties based on mutual interests in \nmaintaining democratic institutions; combating narcotrafficking; and cooperating in \nfostering Equador\u2019s economic development by building trade, investment, and financial \nties. \n \n \nThe United States has long enjoyed favorable relations with Columbia. The \nUnited States provides substantial support to the Colombian government\u2019s counter-\nnarcotics efforts, and encourages the government\u2019s efforts to strengthen its democratic \ninstitutions in order to promote security, stability, and prosperity in the region. Although \nthe government\u2019s respect for human rights continues to improve, serious problems \nremain, including: unlawful and extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, \ninsubordinate military personnel who collaborate with criminal groups, torture and \nmistreatment of detainees, and other serious human rights abuses. Illegal armed groups \nand terrorist groups committed the majority of human rights violations\u2013including political \nkillings and kidnappings, forced disappearances, torture, and other serious human \nrights abuses. Violence by narcoterrorist groups and other criminal elements continues \nto affect all parts of the country, urban and rural, including border areas. Citizens of the \nUnited States and other countries continue to be victims of threats, kidnapping, and \nother criminal acts. Since 1998, at least ten U.S. citizens have been kidnapped near \nEcuador\u2019s border with Columbia. \n \n \nThe U.S. Secretary of State has designated three Colombian groups \u2013 the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), \nand the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) \u2013 as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations. These groups have carried out bombings and other attacks in and \naround major urban areas, including against civilian targets. Terrorist groups have also \ntargeted critical infrastructure (e.g., water, oil, gas, and electricity), public recreational \nareas, and modes of transportation. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.7 \n \n \n6  AE 1 at 7. \n \n7  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d8 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n8  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder Guideline C the government\u2019s concern is that \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in \nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then \nhe or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. \n \n \nApplicant considers himself a dual citizen of the United States and Ecuador. His \nmilitary service in Ecuador was before he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003. \nSince approximately 1991, he has made the United States his home. Applicant\u2019s \npossession and use of an Ecuadorian passport in preference of his U.S. passport, \nhowever, constitute an exercise of dual citizenship and raises security concerns under \nGuideline C. Foreign preference disqualifying condition AG 10(a): exercise of any right, \nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the \nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes . . . (1): possession of a current \nforeign passport, applies. \n \n \nSince 2005, Applicant has stated his intent to surrender his Ecuadorian passport \nand to renounce his Ecuadorian citizenship. In October 2007, he surrendered his \nEcuadorian passport to his FSO. By surrendering his passport, he forfeits the flexibility \nof unfettered and undocumented travel. Any attempt by Applicant to retrieve his \nEcuadorian passport will be documented and reported to the U.S. Government. These \nfacts warrant application of Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 11.b: the \nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship; and AG \u00b6 11e.: the \npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or \notherwise invalidated. I find that Applicant\u2019s FSO qualifies under the AGs as the \n\u201ccognizant security authority.\u201d Applicant has mitigated the foreign preference security \nconcerns. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                     \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. In this case, the most pertinent are: \na) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; . . ., \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and,  \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.9 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with his parents, sister, extended family \nmembers, friends in the Ecuadorian military, and his parents-in-law who are residents \nand citizens of Ecuador. His wife is a foreign national. He has property in Colombia. His \nconnection to his family members and his wife\u2019s family, as well as his relationship with \nseveral Ecuadorian military officers  create a potential conflict of interest because his \nrelationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to help \nthem or the government of Ecuador by providing sensitive or classified information.  \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising four potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nI considered five foreign influence mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 as \npotentially applicable to the disqualifying conditions in this case: \n \n9  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. \n8, 2001). \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority . . .;  \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \nThe evidence shows Applicant has strong feelings of affection and a strong \nsense of obligation to his spouse, parents, sister, extended family and friends in \nEcuador, as well as to his in-laws. The closeness of the relationship is shown by \nApplicant\u2019s frequent telephone and e-mail contacts. His frequent travels to Ecuador with \nhis wife and kids to visit their family and friends underscores his deep feelings of \naffection and/or obligation to his family. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s close contacts with senior \nEcuadorian military personnel (his brother-in-law and his friends) increase the security \nconcerns.  \nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be exploited, \nI considered Ecuador\u2019s democratic form of government.10 I also considered that the \nUnited States and Ecuador have maintained close ties based on mutual interests in \nmaintaining democratic institutions; combating narcotrafficking; and cooperating in \nfostering Equador\u2019s economic development. There is no evidence that the government \nof Ecuador possesses an aggressive or hostile intelligence/security profile against the \nUnited States, or is otherwise engaged in efforts to acquire military, technical, or \neconomic information from the United States. \n \n10  The focus is not the country or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the government they \nimpose. This approach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each country in accordance with the level \nof security concern or threat it presents to the United States.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                     \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c) apply but \nonly to a certain extent. His frequent contacts and close relationships with his \nEcuadorian family, in-laws, and Ecuadorian military officers could potentially force him \nto choose between the United States interests and those of Ecuador. Applicant did not \nfully establish it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between \nthe interests of his family and friends in Ecuador and the interests of the United States.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies because Applicant has a longstanding relationship and loyalty \ntowards the United States. His father inculcated in him the desire to become an \nAmerican. Applicant resigned his position in the Ecuadorian military to work in the \nUnited States, and he has been living in the United States with his wife and children \nsince around 1991. The only reason he is currently living in Colombia is because of his \njob with a defense contractor providing services for a U.S. agency.  \n \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s evidence convincingly established that he has been \nwillingly assuming a high level of risk while working on behalf of the United States. He \nhas demonstrated to several officials of another agency that he can be trusted to \ncomply with security procedures and regulations while working on dangerous, high-risk \nmissions for the United States. His past behavior convinces me that his ties and sense \nof obligation to the United States is sufficiently strong that he could be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.9 It also gives credibility to \nhis assertions that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report attempts at \ncoercion or exploitation from family and friends living in foreign countries.10 \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) applies because Applicant\u2019s financial/economic interests in Ecuador \nand Colombia are outweighed by the value of his financial interests in the United States. \nI find his financial/economic interests in both Ecuador and Colombia are not likely to \nresult in a conflict of interest, and could not be used effectively to influence or pressure \nApplicant.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n \n9  Directive \u00b6 E2. 8(b). See ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006.) (Applicant\u2019s \nwork as an interpreter in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in \nwhich [he] made a significant contribution to the national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). \n \n10  Id. \n\n \n12 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable AGs. I specifically considered \nApplicant\u2019s testimony as well as his references\u2019 statements. Applicant is a U.S. citizen \nand two of his children are U.S. citizens. I considered his age, occupation, the period of \ntime he has been living in the United States, and his professed intent to make the \nUnited States his home and to retire in the United States. I considered Applicant\u2019s \noutstanding job performance for his current employer, and that he is highly regarded for \nhis unswerving dedication, trustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nApplicant has established by credible, independent evidence that he has can be \ntrusted to comply with security procedures and regulations while working on dangerous, \nhigh-risk missions on behalf of the United States. Applicant\u2019s past behavior under these \ndangerous circumstances shows that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport attempts at coercion or exploitation from family and friends living in foreign \ncountries. Applicant\u2019s ties and sense of obligation to the United States is sufficiently \nstrong that he could be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United \nStates.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference and foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.w: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe government\u2019s evidence failed to establish that Applicant was at heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of his limited family\nconnections to Egypt. Clearance granted.\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated  2\n1\nJanuary 1992, as amended and revised\u2014most recently in August 2006 (Directive).\nThe substantive evidence consists of the SOR, Applicant\u2019s Answer, and his June 2005 clearance application.\n2\nIn fact, this belief may be erroneous. The U.S. State Department Consular Information Sheet for Egypt\n3\n(December 2006) states: \u201cMale dual citizens who have not completed military service are not generally required to enlist\nin the Armed Forces. However, they must obtain an exemption certificate through the Ministry of Defense Draft Office\nbefore they can leave Egypt. Individuals who may be affected can inquire at an Egyptian consulate abroad before\ntraveling to Egypt.\u201d This suggests that Applicant might not be detained, despite his AWOL status, but also that he could\ndiscover any impediment in that area without leaving the U.S., simply by contacting an Egyptian consulate.\nAlthough not stated in the record, I infer this based on the facts that he married a U.S. citizen in August  1985,\n4\nshortly after he immigrated to the U.S., and became a legal permanent resident (LPR) of the U.S., a status he could not\nhave been given unless he was lawfully in the U.S., either on a valid passport or a grant of asylum.\nSpouses of U.S. citizens may apply for citizenship \n5\nafter three years legal permanent residence in the U.S., compared to the regular five-year waiting period. Applicant would\nhave become a legal permanent resident (LPR) after he married in 1985.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 4 April 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of foreign\ninfluence concerns.  He answered the SOR 24 April 2007, and requested a decision without hearing.\n1\nHe did not respond to DOHA\u2019s 15 June 2007 File of Relevant Material (FORM).  The record closed\n2\n25 July 2007, the day the response was due. DOHA assigned the case to me 2 August 2007.\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, but provided annotations indicating that a\nbrother who resided in Sudan had moved to the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and one sister\nresiding in Egypt was a U.S. citizen. Accordingly, I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 55-year-old product assurance manager, continuously employed by the same\ndefense contractor since August 1987. He seeks to retain the access to classified information he has\nheld since approximately December 1993.\nApplicant was born in Egypt in October 1951. In 1985, he went absent-without-leave\n(AWOL) from the Egyptian Air Force and immigrated to the U.S. In August 1985, he married, and\nremains married to, a native-born U.S. citizen\u2014an act prohibited by the Egyptian Air Force.\nApplicant believes he can never return to Egypt because he might be detained by the authorities.  He\n3\nimmigrated to the U.S. on a valid Egyptian passport,  and obtained U.S. citizenship in October\n4\n1989.5\nIn November 1985, Applicant\u2019s background was investigated on to perform contract work\nfor the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that did not require access to classified information.\n\nThe government alleged no travel to Egypt, a routine allegation in Guideline B cases. In addition, Applicant\u2019s\n6\nclearance application confirms the June 2000 issue date for his passport, and records his not having a valid foreign\npassport within the last seven years (to June 1998). However, he reported foreign travel to Mexico in March 1999 and\nto Canada in July 2000. At that time, Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. permitted land border crossings and returns to the\nU.S. with any form of proof of U.S. citizenship. For Applicant, as a naturalized U.S. citizen, the only two forms of proof\nwould be his naturalization certificate or a U.S. passport, as a birth certificate or any identification showing place of birth\nwould show Egypt as the place of birth. Given that he was first eligible to apply for a U.S. passport in October 1989, that\nprocessing times likely meant that he could not receive his first passport until sometime in early 1990, and that adult\npassports are valid for 10 years from date issued, I infer that he probably traveled to Mexico in March 1999 on his first\npassport but had to obtain a new passport in June 2000 for his July 2000 trip.\nThis information must have come from a subject interview, because it does not appear in Applicant\u2019s clearance\n7\napplication, the only document pre-dating the SOR.\nU.S. State Department Background Note: Egypt, March 2007.\n8\n3\nApplicant went to work for his current employer in August 1987. He became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in October 1989. In approximately December 1993, he was granted his secret industrial\nclearance. He appears to have held this clearance without incident since. He obtained his most-recent\nU.S. passport in June 2000. To the government\u2019s knowledge, he has never traveled to Egypt since\ncoming to the U.S. and has not had an Egyptian passport since it expired after he immigrated to the\nU.S.6\nIn June 2005, Applicant completed a security clearance application to initiate a periodic\nreinvestigation of his clearance. He reported his Egyptian birth and his dual citizenship\u2014past or\notherwise. He listed his 89-year-old father, two older sisters, and two younger brothers, all citizens\nof Egypt and all but one sister residing in Cairo, albeit at unknown addresses. He does not know\nwhere his oldest sister lives, but indicated that she holds dual Egyptian/United Kingdom citizenship.\nApplicant\u2019s employer certified that all local agency checks had been performed with favorable results\nbefore submitting the application.\nApplicant was presumably interviewed during his current background investigation,\nproviding the information about his going AWOL from the Egyptian Air Force (SOR 1.e.) and\nmarrying a U.S. citizen in violation of Egyptian Air Force regulations (SOR 1.f.), as well as the fact\nthat one brother now resided in Saudi Arabia (SOR 1.c.).  In his annotations to his answer, Applicant\n7\nindicated that this brother, a doctor, now resides  in the U.A.E. He also noted that one of his sisters\nmarried a U.S. citizen, and had become a naturalized U.S. citizen, residing with her husband in\nEgypt.\nEgypt is a republic that obtained its independence from Great Britain in 1922. Its population\nof 79 million, including 16 million in Cairo, makes it the most populous country in the Arab world\nand the second-most populous in Africa. Egypt and the U.S. enjoy a strong and friendly relationship\nbased on shared mutual interest in Middle East peace and stability, revitalizing the Egyptian\neconomy and strengthening trade relations, and promoting regional security.  Egypt remains a strong\n8\nmilitary and strategic partner of the U.S., and is a key partner in the search for peace in the Middle\nEast and resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, Egypt has a poor human rights\nrecord and has been subject to terrorist attacks. Nevertheless, Egypt is not a known collector of U.S.\nintelligence or sensitive economic information. Egypt is not known to target U.S. citizens to obtain\nprotected information.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n9\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n10\n4\nPOLICIES AND BURDENS\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.9\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests may\nraise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, 2) may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ncontrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign\ninfluence adjudications can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information requires\n10\ncareful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target protected information,\nand to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that information, and the individual\u2019s\nsusceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive. More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n11\nNeither of which did Department Counsel identify as countries of concern. The records for administrative\n12\nnotice pertain to Egypt solely.\n5\nwith foreign family members (or other foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if\nthose contacts create a heightened risk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.11\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline B.\nConsidering first the foreign country involved, Egypt and the U.S. enjoy excellent foreign relations,\nand shared interests over a wide range of issues. Further, in order for Applicant\u2019s family members\nto be in a position to be used as a pressure point on Applicant\u2014whether benign or malevolent\u2014there\nmust be a government or other entity ready, willing, and able to collect protected information and\nuse it. Egypt is not known to target protected U.S. information, nor is it known to target U.S. citizens\nto obtain protected information. In addition, in this case it is not clear what claim Egypt might have\non Applicant. He has never traveled there, is unlikely to travel there given his belief that he might\nbe detained for being AWOL over 20 years, is unlikely to be detained for failing to complete his\nmilitary obligation even if he traveled there on the only passport he has\u2014a U.S. passport\u2014and could\ndetermine his risk of being detained by contacting an Egyptian consulate without leaving the U.S.\nThe risk that Egypt might seek protected information from Applicant is low, if not non-existent.\nOn the Applicant side of the equation, the government produced no evidence that there was\nany risk, much less a heightened risk, of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion because of Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts in Egypt. The government failed to\nestablish any security concerns related to Applicant\u2019s family members residing in Egypt. The State\nDepartment Background Note on Egypt submitted by the government establishes no basis for\nconcern, and Department Counsel has articulated no reason why Applicant\u2019s relatives residing in\nEgypt raise security concerns. Department Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s factual admissions\u2014that\nhe has family members residing in Egypt\u2014establishes the prima facie case that Applicant must\nrefute. For that to be so, Applicant must be considered to have admitted the legal conclusion asserted\nby the SOR, that the facts alleged raise the security concern stated under Guideline B, which merely\nquotes the stated concern in \u00b66 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines. However, Applicant\u2019s\nfactual admissions do not constitute an admission to the legal conclusions. Further \u00b66 and \u00b67.(a)\ncontemplate, and Department Counsel acknowledges in argument, that family ties alone are not\nenough to establish a concern under Guideline B. There must be a heightened risk as well, and the\ngovernment has to produce the facts to establish that risk. The government\u2019s facts show that\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his family members in Egypt were sufficient for him to place them in\nCairo, Egypt, but not otherwise provide addresses for them. Applicant has apparently had enough\ncontact with his brother, the doctor, to document the brother\u2019s moves to Saudi Arabia and U.A.E.12\nHe also provided information that one sister has become a U.S. citizen and resides in Egypt with her\nAmerican husband. None of these facts is sufficient to establish a heightened risk.\nSimilarly, Department Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s status as a former member of the\nEgyptian Air Force regardless of duty status (i.e., going AWOL from the Egyptian Air Force,\nimmigrating to the U.S., and marrying a U.S. citizen in violation of Egyptian Air Force regulations)\n\n\u00b67.(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest\n13\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help\na foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. (Emphasis Added)\n6\nconstitutes a conflict of interest cognizable under \u00b67.(b).  Presumably, his acquiring U.S.\n13\ncitizenship, in likely violation of Egyptian Air Force regulations, raises additional conflicts. The\nhyperbolic hypothetical highlights the argument\u2019s absurdity. I cannot imagine a better demonstration\nof his intent to sever all contacts with the Egyptian Air Force and the Egyptian government than\ngoing AWOL, leaving, Egypt and immigrating to the U.S. Further, there is no evidence whatsoever\nthat Applicant has a desire to help any foreign entity, personal, group, corporate, or governmental.\nViewed from a common sense perspective, the record evidence does not support the speculative\nscenarios suggested by the government. There is nothing in the known circumstances of Applicant\u2019s\nrelatives in Egypt, or the nature and extent of his contacts with them, to heighten the risk that he\ncould be impelled to provide protected information to Egypt. Speculation, supposition, or\nimagination cannot substitute for the facts necessary to convert remote possibility into reasonable\nprobability. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n   Paragraph 1.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has lived in the United States since the 1970s. He became a United States citizen\nin 1985. He has one elderly sibling living in Vietnam; all of his other immediate family members\nreside in the United States. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\n\n2\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, (as administratively reissued on April 20, 1999), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to\napplicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine\nwhether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 14, 2007. The case was assigned to the\nundersigned on April 16, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on May 8, 2007, and the hearing was\nheld on May 30, 2007. The transcript was received on June 8, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 54 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was born in Vietnam. In 1972, he moved from South Vietnam to the United States\nto attend college. He intended to return to South Vietnam after he completed his studies; however,\nwhen the Communists took over South Vietnam, he decided to remain in the United States. He\nmarried his current wife in the United States in 1974. They both became United States citizens in\n1985. Their only child was born in the United States. \nWhen South Vietnam fell to the Communists, applicant\u2019s parents and three siblings fled\nVietnam with the help of the United States military. These family members settled in the United\nStates. In 1978,  another four of applicant\u2019s siblings left Vietnam and settled in the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s only immediate family member still living in Vietnam is an elderly sister who was too\nsick to flee Vietnam. She is retired and has been a widow for over 30 years (TR at 25). Applicant\nprovides monetary support to her and other extended family members still living in Vietnam. He\nmaintains a bank account in a Vietnamese bank to distribute the money to these relatives. He funds\nthe Vietnamese bank account by wiring funds directly from his bank account in the United States.\nThe three  relatives referred to in SOR Paragraph 1.b. are applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s three siblings.\nThey moved to the United States in 2006 and were granted permanent resident status.\nBetween March 1998 and June 2006, applicant visited Vietnam nine times. He testified\ncredibly that he made these trips to visit and care for his sister. He made the trips because he is the\none sibling out of his family who can afford to travel there. While in Vietnam, he had no contact\nwith Vietnamese government officials, and nobody showed an interest in what he did for a living.\nApplicant further testified that he has no reason to go back to Vietnam after his elderly sister passes\naway (TR at 46).\nApplicant has a home in the United States in which he has $500,000.00 to $600,000.00 in\nequity. He also has a 401k plan with a balance of $180,000.00 to $200,000.00. The bank account he\nhas in Vietnam, in which he keeps a small amount of money, is the only asset he has in Vietnam.\nApplicant testified that the United States is the best country in the world and he wouldn\u2019t do\nanything to jeopardize its interests.\n\nDespite laws to the contrary, as recently as 2006, Vietnam continued to arrest and detain\n1\ncitizens for their political activities (Exhibit 1).\n3\nLetters from applicant\u2019s supervisors, coworkers, and customers in the defense industry were\nadmitted into evidence. These letters describe applicant as a hardworking, dedicated employee who\nis extremely trustworthy and loyal.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that applicant has an elderly sister still living in Vietnam, and that\nhe travels to Vietnam to visit and care for her. On a common sense basis, applicant\u2019s contacts with\nhis sister, particularly his contacts with her when he travels to Vietnam, create a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation. Accordingly, Disqualifying Conditions 7.a (contact with a foreign family\nmember . . . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion), 7.b (connections to\na foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire\nto help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information) and 7.i (conduct,\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country) are\napplicable.\nThe foreign influence concerns raised by the foreign citizenship and/or residency of an\napplicant's immediate family member may be mitigated when it can be determined that \u201cthe nature\nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\npositions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the United States\u201d (Mitigation Condition 8.a),\nand/or \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation\nto the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d (Mitigating Condition 8.b).\nWith respect to Mitigating Condition 8.a, applicant's sister is in her mid-70s and retired. She\nis not an agent of Vietnam, and does not engage in activity that is likely to call attention to her\nactivities. The country in which she is located is somewhat problematic because countries run by\nCommunist regimes with a record of human rights abuses, such as Vietnam,  are generally regarded\n1\nas presenting more of a risk than counties with strong democratic institutions and respect for the rule\nof law. At the same time, the U.S. State Department reports that although Vietnam remains a\nCommunist state, economic development has taken priority over adherence to ideological orthodoxy.\nSince the United States normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam in July 1995, the United States\nand Vietnam have broadened political exchanges and economic trade. In December 2001, the United\nStates and Vietnam entered into a bilateral trade agreement, expanding Vietnamese exports and\ndirect United States investment in the Vietnamese economy. This was a significant milestone for\nVietnam\u2019s economy and for normalization of U.S.-Vietnamese relations. Without a doubt, U.S.-\n\nExhibit 2.\n2\n4\nVietnamese relations \u201chave become deeper and more diverse\u201d in the years since political\nnormalization. See Background Note: Vietnam.  These facts lead me to conclude that Vietnam is\n2\nmuch less likely than in previous years to jeopardize its diplomatic and economic ties with the\nUnited States by using applicant\u2019s sister to pressure or coerce applicant. Based on the foregoing, I\nconclude Mitigation Condition 8.a is applicable.\nMitigation Condition 8.b is also applicable. Applicant clearly has a sense of obligation to his\nsister in Vietnam. However, when compared to his bonds to his wife, child, and siblings residing in\nthe United States, and his long-standing ties and loyalty to the United States, I am persuaded that,\nin the unlikely event he was forced to choose between his loyalty to his sister and loyalty to the\nUnited States, he would resolve this conflict in favor of the United States.\n Based on the foregoing, I conclude there is no reasonably foreseeable risk that applicant\u2019s\nties to his sister can be exploited to the detriment of the United States.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nGUIDELINE B: FOR THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCaroline H. Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 27 years old, unmarried, and works for a defense contractor in the health\ninsurance business as a claims resolution processor.  She has two disorderly conduct arrests, and two\ndriving while intoxicated arrests. Applicant did not mitigate the alcohol consumption trustworthiness\nconcern.  She did mitigate the personal conduct trustworthiness concern.  Eligibility for a public trust\nposition is denied.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n1\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\nfor Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trustworthiness for Applicant .  On February 28, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of\n1\nReasons  (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\n2\nG (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines of the Directive issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of\nDefense, effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 16, 2007,\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on June\n20, 2007.  On August 7, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for Applicant.  The\nGovernment submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  Applicant did not submit any\nexhibits at the hearing.  The record was kept open until August 21, 2007, to allow Applicant to\nsubmit exhibits concerning her alcohol evaluation program in 2006, but no additional exhibits were\nreceived.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations, and they are incorporated as findings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 27 years old, unmarried, and works for a defense contractor in the health\ninsurance business.  She has worked there for three and a half years as a claims resolution processor.\nShe graduated from high school and attended college for two semesters. (Tr. 26, 28; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant was arrested on December 27, 2003, on charges of battery and disorderly conduct.\nShe and another woman were involved in an argument at a local nightclub.  Applicant hit the other\nwoman with her hand in the club parking lot.  Applicant was drinking alcohol before the incident.\nApplicant claims she only had two or three beers.  She pled \u201cno contest\u201d to the charges, and was\nfined $243, and completed a nine-month \u201cValues, Influences, and Peers\u201d program, an Alcohol and\nOther Drug program over nine weeks, and some follow-up counseling.  After completion of these\nrequirements, Applicant resumed drinking \u201csocially,\u201d consuming \u201ca couple of beers here and there.\u201d\nApplicant claims she was told if she completed these requirements, the arrest would not appear on\nher record.  She did not disclose this arrest on her trustworthiness application of November 3, 2005.\n(Tr. 22, 29-34, 61, 62; Exhibits 1-3)\nApplicant was arrested on October 3, 2004, for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated\nand with a prohibited alcohol concentration (PAC).  She drove a friend\u2019s car away from the bar at\n\n3\n4 p.m. that afternoon.  She had been drinking at another bar earlier in the day.  She collided with\nanother car in the parking lot of the first bar after she drove back there from the second bar.  She\nclaims she was drinking beer and shots, having had only two or three beers.  Her blood alcohol\ncontent (BAC) was .23%.  The legal limit in her state is .08%.  She drove the car because she thought\nshe was the soberest person in her group of friends.  She pled \u201cno contest\u201d to the driving while\nintoxicated charge, was fined $725, ordered to undergo an alcohol assessment and group dynamics\nclasses which she did from November 2004 to August 2005, and her driver\u2019s license was revoked\nfor eight months.  Applicant does not remember any diagnosis of an alcohol condition after her\nassessment.  Applicant rode to work with a friend while her license was revoked, and did not drink\ntoo often during that time period, she claims.  However, she admitted she did drive occasionally. (Tr.\n37-43, 57; Exhibits 1-3)\nApplicant was arrested on September 5, 2005, for disorderly conduct at a bar.  She needed\nto use the bathroom, but it was occupied, so she urinated in the alley behind the bar.  She was fined,\nbut the fine was returned when the charges were dropped because the arresting police officer did not\nappear in court.  Applicant understood that because the charges were dropped this arrest would not\nbe on her record.  Consequently, she did not disclose it on her trustworthiness application of\nNovember 3, 2005.  Applicant claims she only drank one or two beers. (Tr. 24, 43, 44; Exhibits 1-3)\nApplicant was arrested on March 3, 2006, for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated,\n2  offense, and PAC.  She was arrested less than four miles from the bar she attended.  Her BAC\nnd\nwas .25%.  Again, she pled \u201cno contest.\u201d  She was sentenced to eight days in jail, and allowed\nrelease during the day to go to work, fined $1,375, had her driver\u2019s license revoked for 14 months\n(it remains revoked), and was ordered to take multiple offender classes at a local college.  The\nassessment at the college in June 2006, resulted in a diagnosis of \u201cirresponsible use of alcohol.\u201d (Tr.\n45-50, 58; Exhibits 1-3)\nApplicant started drinking alcohol in high school at age 17.  She characterizes her drinking\nas \u201csocial\u201d, and the maximum she drinks at any one occasion is three beers, according to her\nrecollection, but never considered herself or felt like she was drunk an any occasion.  Applicant\u2019s\nlisted weight on her trustworthiness application is 125 pounds.  She admitted she drank and drove\na few more times than those when she was arrested, and that occasionally she drove to the store and\ngas station while her driving privileges were revoked.  Applicant does not consider herself as having\na problem with alcohol.  She considers her arrests as bad luck and being at the wrong place at the\nwrong time.  She disputes the December 2003, disorderly conduct incident as reported by the\narresting police officer. (Tr. 27-29, 31, 34, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 50-52, 63)\nApplicant completed her trustworthiness application on November 3, 2005.  In answering\nQuestion 20 (in the last seven years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any\noffenses?), she stated, \u201cYes,\u201d listing her October 2004, operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated\noffense.  She did not list her December 2003, and September 2005, disorderly conduct arrests in\nanswer to Question 20.  She understood these arrests were not on her record, and therefore, she\nclaims she made a decision not to list them.  No one helped her complete the application or told her\nnot to list the arrests. (Tr. 22-24, 53-55; Exhibit 1-3) \nPOLICIES\n\n4\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and the revised Guidelines, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Those assessments include:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity\nat the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence (See revised Guidelines \u00b62.a., effective September 1, 2006).  Because each case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse\ninformation concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination,\nthe individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of\nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the Guidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\n\n5\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption: The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often\nleads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \u00b621\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \u00b615\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  The revised Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, set forth the\nadjudicative policy, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nassociated with each guideline.  DoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures\ncontained in the Directive. (Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline G: Applicant has a ten-year history of drinking.  She has two disorderly conduct\narrests resulting from her drinking.  She has two operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated arrests,\nwith the latest arrest occurring in March 2006.  She participated in two assessment programs, and\nwas diagnosed in the second program as being an irresponsible user of alcohol.  Her two operating\narrests were based on property damage, and a BAC of .23% in the first one, and a BAC of .25% in\nthe second one.  In neither case did Applicant consider herself drunk.  She consistently characterized\nher drinking as \u201csocial\u201d and never more than three beers.  Yet, at 125 pounds of weight, to achieve\na BAC of .23% and .25% she must have consumed more than she remembers, or is deliberately\nminimizing her alcohol use and consumption.  \nThe Disqualifying Conditions (DC) that are applicable are \u00b622.a (alcohol-related incidents\naway from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent), and \u00b622.c (habitual consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent).\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption patterns caused her legal difficulties.  Two drunk driving incidents\n\n6\nin two years, plus her admission she drove drunk on other occasions, shows questionable judgment\nand a continuing failure to control her impulses.  Couple these incidents with her continued\nstatements that all she ever drinks is two or three beers socially, demonstrates a lack of recognition\nof her alcohol problem.  I do not find her explanations credible or persuasive.\nThe Mitigating Conditions (MC) in \u00b623 of the revised Guideline G do not apply to the pattern\nof conduct and habitual use of alcohol demonstrated by Applicant.  It is her burden of proof to\npersuade me the MC should be applied in her favor.  She has done nothing to accomplish that goal\nand meet her burden.  She did not submit any alcohol assessment from the two court-ordered\nprograms she attended in 2004 and 2006, nor did she present any current alcohol assessment she\nmight have obtained at her own expense to counter the Government\u2019s evidence.  She denies she has\na problem with alcohol.  She had no persuasive evidence to explain how her drinking habits resulted\nin BAC three times her state\u2019s legal limits.  Obviously, she was minimizing her consumption and\nhas a more serious problem with alcohol than she realizes.\nGuideline E: Applicant did not list two disorderly conduct arrests on her trustworthiness\napplication because she thought that the first would not appear on her record after she completed the\ncourt-ordered community service and education programs based on what she was told in court, and\nthe second charge was dismissed when the arresting officer did not appear in court and her fine was\nreturned.  That is a reasonable understanding by someone inexperienced in the legal system, and who\nfailed to think through fully Question 20 on the application.\nThe DC which might apply is \u00b616.(a) involving deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, or determine\ntrustworthiness.  However, I find Applicant\u2019s explanation credible as to why she did not list the two\narrests.  She listed the one driving and alcohol offense because it was on her record.  These two\noffense were comparatively minor, particularly the public urination, in contrast to the driving\noffenses.  Therefore, I do not consider Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose them as a deliberate omission\ndesigned to mislead the Government.  On the basis of that conclusion, this DC does not apply.  No\nMC need be applied if no DC apply.\nWhole Person Analysis:  \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\" eligible for a\ntrustworthiness decision. (Revised Guidelines \u00b62.a)  \"Eligibility for access to classified information\nis predicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudication\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should\nbe considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the\nadjudicative factors listed in the revised Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, contained in \u00b62.a.\nApplicant is a mature person who is responsible for her actions.  She engages in a pattern of\ndrinking that in three years resulted in four arrests.  Two arrests were serious driving and drinking\noffenses.  Her driving privileges were revoked twice, and currently remain revoked.  Her voluntary\ndrinking in bars with friends, the continuous pattern of it over the past four years, her minimizing\nof its extent and effect on her behavior, coupled with her lack of responsibility for her drunk driving\noffenses, and her attitude that the incidents were merely \u201cbad luck,\u2019 all demonstrate a serious lack\n\n7\nof good judgment and responsible behavior.  Because Applicant does not consider herself as having\nan alcohol problem, it is likely the behavior will continue, resulting in more arrests.  She has not\nchanged her behavior or developed other interests to replace the need to drink alcohol.  Applicant\nhas not comprehended and incorporated the lessons she learned at two assessment programs to\nchange her behavior.  Applicant displayed a consistent lack of good judgment in these actions and\nattitudes.  These actions demonstrate Applicant is not reliable and trustworthy.\nAccordingly, I conclude the alcohol consumption trustworthiness concern against Applicant.\nI conclude the personal conduct trustworthiness concern for Applicant.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\nconcept\u201d against Applicant on the alcohol issue.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.\nHer application for eligibility for an public trust position is denied.\nPhilip S.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the facts underlining all of the SOR allegations, and provided some explanations. He denied, however, that his behavior would make him a risk to national security. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 44-year-old electrical engineer working for a Government contractor. He served honorably in the U.S. Navy from 1983 to 1989, and achieved the rank of E-4 (Tr. 39). He attended college from 1990 to 1996, and received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree in electrical engineering in May 1996 (Tr. 5, 40). From 2001 to 2005 he studied music at another U.S. university (Tr. 63). He married his wife in March 1988 and they were divorced in May 1996 (Tr. 36). He has a 19-year-old son of this marriage who is attending college. Applicant provides $450 a month to his son. Additionally, he provides approximately $200 to both his son and ex-wife to assist with his son\u2019s college expenses (Tr. 36-37). He has worked for his current employer, a Government contractor, since May 1996. He received access to classified information at the secret level when he was hired and has worked on numerous classified projects (Tr. 6, 43). There is no evidence he has compromised classified information. He has no police record, and there is no evidence he has used or trafficked in illegal drugs. 2 On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defens",

His evidence is insufficient to show that he has a track record \nof financial responsibility, or that his gambling problem is under control. He failed to \nmitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 28, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application or \nStandard Form (SF) 86.1 On April 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n \n1  GE 1.  \n \nSeptember 10, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                                          \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). It detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 2, 2008, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on June 4, 2008. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on June 24, 2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled on July \n15, 2008. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were \nadmitted without objection (Tr. 20). Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented \n10 documents identified as Applicants Exhibits (AE) 1-10 (Tr. 31). DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 21, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the facts underlining all of the SOR allegations, and provided \nsome explanations. He denied, however, that his behavior would make him a risk to \nnational security. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old electrical engineer working for a Government \ncontractor. He served honorably in the U.S. Navy from 1983 to 1989, and achieved the \nrank of E-4 (Tr. 39). He attended college from 1990 to 1996, and received his \nBachelor\u2019s Degree in electrical engineering in May 1996 (Tr. 5, 40). From 2001 to 2005 \nhe studied music at another U.S. university (Tr. 63). He married his wife in March 1988 \nand they were divorced in May 1996 (Tr. 36). He has a 19-year-old son of this marriage \nwho is attending college. Applicant provides $450 a month to his son. Additionally, he \nprovides approximately $200 to both his son and ex-wife to assist with his son\u2019s college \nexpenses (Tr. 36-37). \n \nHe has worked for his current employer, a Government contractor, since May \n1996. He received access to classified information at the secret level when he was hired \nand has worked on numerous classified projects (Tr. 6, 43). There is no evidence he \nhas compromised classified information. He has no police record, and there is no \nevidence he has used or trafficked in illegal drugs. \n \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his security clearance application, his answers to DOHA \ninterrogatories (GEs 3, 4 and 5), and three credit bureau reports (CBRs) from 2006 (GE \n7), and two from 2007 (GEs 5 and 6). The SOR alleged two delinquent/charged off \naccounts totaling approximately $50,179. It also alleged that Applicant has a gambling \nproblem and that he improperly used his corporate credit card to obtain money for \ngambling. The allegations are supported by the record evidence. \n \nApplicant explained he had financial problems when he was in the Navy, but was \nable to take care of his debts (Tr. 41). While in the Navy, he consolidated 14 debts, \ntotaling $7,000, and paid them off (Tr. 79). From 1990 to 1996, he also had financial \nproblems because both he and his wife were attending college, worked part-time, and \nthey had a child. He had a car repossessed in 1993-1994 (Tr. 80).  \n \nWhile in college, Applicant applied for four student loans which have been in \ndefault since 1996 (SOR \u00b6 1a). He believes his total student loan debt is $56,325 \nbecause the creditors recently added $9,000 in penalties to his debt (Tr. 46-47). He \nclaimed that in 2000 he entered into a payment rehabilitation program and paid $800 a \nmonth for 19 months towards his student loans. He was considered to be in good \nstanding. However, he \u201clet it slide again\u201d in 2002, and the loans have been delinquent \nsince (Tr. 44). He stopped paying his student loans because of \u201chis financial \nnegligence\u201d \u2013 he was spending his earnings elsewhere (Tr. 44). Since 1996, he has had \nno unemployment or underemployment periods, and did not have any other financial \nproblems to prevent him from paying his loans (Tr. 44, 50). The Friday before his \nhearing, Applicant contacted the student loans creditor and established a Direct Debit \nelectronic payment agreement. He promised to pay $395 every two weeks to settle his \nstudent loans debt. The first payment was supposed to start eleven days after his \nhearing. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b concerns one of Applicant\u2019s delinquent credit cards. He used his \ncredit cards to obtain gambling money. In March 2008, he borrowed $19,000 from his \n401(k) account to pay this debt. He settled SOR \u00b6 1.b ($7,947) for $5,400 (AE 9). He \nused $4,150 to pay another debt not alleged in the SOR (AE 8), and to pay his sister \n$6,500 he borrowed from her to pay his previous 401(k) loan (Tr. 57-58, 61). He had to \npay off his firs 401(k) loan first to be able to borrow the $19.000. \n \nApplicant testified that in November 2006, he became concerned about his debt \nand started to make payments trying to get a handle on his debt (Tr. 59). He sought \nfinancial assistance from a debt relief company and consolidated two of his credit card \ndebts. He claimed he paid $500 a month for 13 months through the debt relief company. \nApplicant terminated his agreement in November 2007 when he realized the agreement \ninvolved expensive overhead charges (Tr. 77, AE 6).  \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \nApplicant started gambling in 2002. He has a gambling problem, and his \ndelinquent debts are the result of his gambling problem (Tr. 16, 35). He started losing \nmoney and stopped paying his other debts (Tr. 50-51). Applicant estimated that from \n2002 to 2006, he lost approximately $20,000 a year gambling. He considers himself a \ncompulsive gambler (Tr. 51). He used to gamble five times a month. He has not \nstopped gambling completely, but has cut it back (Tr. 51). He claimed the month before \nhis hearing he gambled only once, and that he only lost $150.  \n \nIn 2006, Applicant used his employer\u2019s business credit card to obtain \napproximately $1,200 for gambling (Tr. 35, 54). He reported to his employer his financial \nand gambling problems, and his misuse of his employer\u2019s credit card (Tr. 55). Applicant \nwas counseled by his supervisor and informed it was illegal for him to use his \ncompany\u2019s business credit card for anything other than business expenses (Tr. 66). He \nunderstood his actions were wrong, and promised not to do it again. Applicant \nimproperly used his company\u2019s business credit card twice again, in 2006 and 2007. He \nreported his misuse of the credit card one time, and his supervisor confronted him the \nsecond time (Tr. 85). \n \nApplicant was referred to the company\u2019s counselors and he spoke to them about \nhis problems; however, he never set up any counseling sessions (Tr. 56). At his \nhearing, Applicant promised to meet with his company\u2019s counselors after the hearing to \ndiscuss his treatment options for his gambling and financial problems (Tr. 57). He was \naware of the Government\u2019s security concerns since April 2008. He did not seek \ncounseling because he believed he could handle his problems on his own. Applicant did \nnot try to stop gambling before because he was afraid of ending that part of his life (Tr. \n83).  \n \nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s earned approximately $70,000 a year. As of his hearing date \nhe was making approximately $85,000 a year (Tr. 52). He pays $600 rent (which \nincludes all utilities). His child support obligation is $460 a month. He provides an \nadditional $200 to both his ex-wife and son to assist him with his son\u2019s college \nexpenses. He promised to pay $800 a month to pay his student loan obligation. He also \npromised to pay $800 a month to pay his 401(k) loan (Tr. 62-64). \n \nApplicant stated he is determined to resolve all of his debts and to stop or reduce \nhis gambling habit. He believes he has made good progress with his debts. He \npromised to change his attitude towards gambling, and to seek counseling for his \ngambling and financial problems. Applicant does not consider himself to be a security \nrisk, and does not believe his behavior makes him a security risk. He promised never to \ndo anything illegal or to do anything to place the United States at risk.  \n \nApplicant is considered a valued employee who is reliable and trustworthy. He \nexhibits good character traits and is respected by his fellow employees. He has never \nhad a security violation and his manager recommends him for a security clearance. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                                          \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4 \n \n \n3  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n4  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern are under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security \nconcern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides five Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the \nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling \nproblems, or other issues of security concern; and \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets or \nreturning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of gambling \nlosses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay gambling debts, family \nconflict or other problems caused by gambling. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented in his security \nclearance application, his answers to the DOHA interrogatories, his credit reports, and \nhis testimony. He has had recurrent financial problems in the late 1980s, early 1990s, \nand more recently since 2002. His current financial problems are linked to his \ncompulsive gambling and his lack of financial responsibility. As of the hearing date, he \nhad one outstanding debt totaling approximately $56,325 which has been delinquent \nsince around 1996 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Although he paid SOR \u00b6 1.b, this debt is still a concern \nbecause he merely changed creditors to bring the debt current. He owes $19,000 to his \n401(k). The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), \nand 19(f).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                                          \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,5 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions fully apply. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b) do not apply because he did not \nact more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. He has been \nsuccessfully employed from 1996 to 2008 and earned enough money to resolve his \ndebt. Applicant presented insufficient evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve, to settle, \nor to pay his delinquent debts. He failed to complete some of his past settlement \nagreements. He receives credit for his last minute attempts to settle his debts and to \npay creditors before his hearing. However, Applicant\u2019s last minute addressing of his \ndelinquent obligations does not establish good-faith6 efforts in the resolution of his \ndebts. These factors cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony established no factors that may be considered as \ncircumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., such \nas a period of unemployment and underemployment. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. \nAlthough there is evidence that he has participated in some financial counseling (while \nin the Navy and by contracting with a debt consolidation/payment service), there are \ninsufficient indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved or are \nunder control. Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a \nfinding that he has established an adequate track record of financial responsibility.7   \n \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n \n6  The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n7  \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n\n \n \n9 \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. AG & 15. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 provides one Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources . . . \n \nApplicant\u2019s repeated misuse of his company\u2019s credit card to gamble and for his \npersonal use constitutes a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, and it is a misuse of \nhis employer\u2019s resources. The government established the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6 16d(3) and (4).   \n \n  \nOf the seven Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a)-(g), I \nconsidered two as potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nI find Applicant\u2019s illegal use of the company\u2019s credit card temporally recent and frequent. \nHe used the credit card after being counseled by his supervisor, and knowing his \npersonal use of the credit card was improper. His behavior creates doubt on Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Moreover, Applicant has not received \nsufficient counseling or taken positive steps to resolve his gambling and financial \nproblems. I find his questionable behavior is likely to recur.  \n \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). \nApplicant\u2019s years of working for Government contractors weighs in his favor. \nAside from his delinquent debts (which are a civil, non-criminal issue), he is a law-\nabiding citizen and a good father. He expressed regrets for his financial mistakes and, \ngambling problems. He is trying to correct them and promised his strong determination \nto change his attitude towards gambling.  \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in his case, including Applicant\u2019s \nage, education, maturity, his years working for the Government contractors, he \ndemonstrated a lack of judgment and trustworthiness in the handling of his financial \naffairs and the use of his company\u2019s credit card. He failed to deal responsibly with his \nfinancial obligations, especially his student loans, from 1996 until receipt of his SOR. \nHis failure to meet his financial obligations, his gambling problem, and his misuse of his \ncompany\u2019s credit card indicates poor self-control or an unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. His behavior raises questions about his reliability and ability to protect \nclassified information.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations and personal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n",

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nAlison O\u2019Connell, Esq., Department Counsel\nJames Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was born in Lebanon, came to the U.S. in 1983 to further his education, and\nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2002.  He obtained a loan from a private foundation in Lebanon to finance\npart of his education, but has not repaid the loan.  He kept his Lebanese passport after becoming a\nU.S. citizen, and he used it several times to visit Lebanon.  After his parents died, he inherited two\napartments, a family home, and a farm in Lebanon.  His wife is a citizen of Lebanon residing with\nhim in the U.S..  His brother, half-sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens\nand residents of Lebanon.  He has refuted the allegation of financial delinquency, but he has not\nmitigated security concerns based on foreign preference and foreign influence.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn June 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) in effect as of September 1, 2006.\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference), B (Foreign Influence),\nand F (Financial Considerations).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 17, 2007, admitted all the allegations, offered\nexplanations, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on August 16, 2007, and heard\nas scheduled on September 20, 2007.  I kept the record open until September 28, 2007, to enable\nApplicant to present additional documentary evidence.  I received his submission on September 28,\nand it has been admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) B.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on\nSeptember 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 45-year-old information technology architect for a defense contractor.  He held\ninterim clearances in the past but has never held a final clearance (Tr. 9).  He is a native of Lebanon.\nAfter graduating from high school in Lebanon, Applicant came to the U.S. in 1983 to\ncontinue his education.  He completed his education in May 1990, receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree and\na master\u2019s degree in computer engineering. \nBetween January 1987 and January 1990, a Lebanese foundation lent Applicant a total of\n$56,368 to pay his tuition, books, fees, and living expenses.  The foundation is a family-owned, non-\npolitical, nonprofit organization (Tr. 154-55).  Foundation loans are available only to Lebanese\nstudents.  The loan is interest-free with no due date for repayment (Tr. 39-40, AX A).  Students\napparently are expected to return to Lebanon upon completing their education, but Applicant\nobtained a waiver from the foundation that permitted him to remain in the U.S. (Tr. 101-02).  Monies\nreceived in repayment of loans from the foundation are used to assist other Lebanese students (Tr.\n42).  The foundation has made no effort to collect the loan, but Applicant contacted the foundation\nto discuss repayment (Tr. 43-44).  About a month before the hearing, he made one payment of $200\n(Tr. 41).  \nApplicant currently earns about $130,000 per year (Tr. 36).  He owns his home and a rental\nproperty in the U.S. which he estimates are worth about one million dollars (Tr. 171).\nApplicant was married in March 2000 to a citizen of South Africa and divorced in April\n2002.  They had a daughter, born in February 2002, for whom he pays child support.  His daughter\nis a U.S. citizen residing in the U.S.  His ex-wife lives in the U.S. and has a U.S. permanent resident\n\n3\nvisa.  Applicant has contact with his ex-wife and daughter weekly, and he sees them twice a year\n(GX 2 at 5). \nApplicant was engaged to a Lebanese citizen in October 2002.  They terminated their\nrelationship in July 2004 (Tr. 58).  They had no contact after they terminated their relationship (Tr.\n59). \nApplicant married his current wife, also a citizen of Lebanon, in October 2004.  His current\nwife resides with him in the U.S. and intends to become a U.S. citizen (Tr. 53).  Applicant has a 14-\nmonth-old son from this marriage, who is a native-born U.S. citizen, and his wife is pregnant with\ntheir second child.  \nAfter Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2002, he retained and used his\nLebanese passport for convenience when he visited Lebanon (GX 2 at 3).  He traveled to Lebanon\nthree times in 2002, to visit family and become engaged to marry (Tr. 114-20).  He traveled to\nLebanon three times in 2004, to visit family, terminate his engagement, and become engaged to his\ncurrent wife (Tr. 120-31).  He traveled to Lebanon again during the Christmas holidays in 2004-\n2005, for his wedding to his current wife in July 2005, and for the Christmas holidays in 2005-2006\n(Tr. 133, 137-43).\nApplicant testified he is willing to relinquish his Lebanese passport, but he has not done so\n(Tr. 32).  His Lebanese passport expires in March 2010.\nApplicant is the oldest of three brothers.  The next oldest is a citizen and resident of Lebanon,\nbut he spends several months a year in the U.S. (Tr. 64-65).  He is involved in an automotive\nbusiness in Lebanon (Tr. 66).  Applicant has contact with him once every month or two (Tr. 65). \nApplicant\u2019s youngest brother is a Lebanese citizen who resides in the U.S. and owns a\nmoving company in the U.S. (Tr. 72-74).  Applicant believes this brother intends to become a U.S.\ncitizen (Tr. 73).  His brother\u2019s wife is a Lebanese citizen, and they have three children, all U.S.\ncitizens (Tr. 76).\nApplicant\u2019s sister is a citizen and resident of Lebanon.  He had no contact with her for several\nyears, because he disapproved of her husband (Tr. 98).  His sister contacted him about six months\nago, but they have had no further contact (Tr. 87-88). \nApplicant\u2019s half-sister is a citizen and resident of Lebanon (Tr. 88).  Applicant talks to her\nabout once a month (Tr. 79).  She is married to a Lebanese school teacher (Tr. 99).\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of\nLebanon.  His mother-in-law and father-in-law are divorced.  His mother-in-law is now in the U.S.\nto assist them when the new baby arrives, but she intends to return to Lebanon in December or\nJanuary (Tr. 90).  Applicant and his wife have no contact with his father-in-law (Tr. 91).  \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen of Lebanon.  He resides temporarily in the United Arab\nEmirates while working there, but his permanent residence is in Lebanon (Tr. 29, 93).  He is a\n\n4\nforeman for a construction company (Tr. 94).  Applicant and his wife talk to him once every month\nor two (Tr. 94-95).\nApplicant traveled to Syria on several occasions while his parents were alive, because they\nworked in a grocery store in Syria.  He also traveled to Syria in 2004 to arrange for his current wife\u2019s\ntravel to the U.S., because the U.S. consulate in Lebanon was not operating (Tr. 131-32).  He\ntestified he dislikes Syria for personal and political reasons (Tr. 31).\nAfter Applicant\u2019s parents died, he inherited two apartments, a family home, and a family\nfarm in Lebanon.  The apartments are in Beirut, and the family home and farm are in a rural area (Tr.\n30).  \nThe apartments are worth a total of about $50,000, and they are managed by a commercial\nrental agency.  One rents for about $150 per month and the other for about $200 per month (Tr. 144-\n45).  Applicant testified that he makes no profit from the rentals, because any profits are given to his\nfamily members in Lebanon (Tr. 146-47).  \nThe family home and farm are worth between $100,000 and $120,000.  They are managed\nand operated by cousins (GX 2 at 7; Tr. 151).  Applicant talks to his cousins infrequently, about three\nor four times a year (Tr. 85).  Any profits from the farm are kept by the cousins who operate it (Tr.\n154).\nApplicant also has a bank account in Lebanon, with a balance between $2,000 and $3,000\n(Tr. 148).  He testified he opened the bank account when he went to Lebanon to be married, but he\nno longer needs it (Tr. 30).  Because there is no internet access, he would be required to travel to\nLebanon to close the account (Tr. 145).\nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request and with no objection by Applicant, I took administrative\nnotice of relevant facts concerning Lebanon.  Department Counsel\u2019s request to take administrative\nnotice is incorporated in the record as Hearing Exhibit I.\nLebanon is a parliamentary republic.  The U.S. has traditionally had close ties with Lebanon,\nand it seeks to help preserve Lebanon\u2019s independence, national unity, and territorial integrity. \nLebanon has been in a state of war with Israel since 1973.  Its foreign policy and internal\npolicies have been heavily influenced by Syria after the entry of Syrian troops into Lebanon in March\n1976.  Even after the withdrawal of Syrian troops in April 2005, Syria continued to conduct\nintelligence activities in Lebanon and to exercise a strong influence on Lebanese politics.\nSyria, designated by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism, provides political and material\nsupport to Hizballah, the most prominent terrorist group in Lebanon.  Hizballah has been designated\nby the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization, closely connected to Iran and a strong ally of Syria in\nadvancing its political objectives in Lebanon.  Hizballah supports numerous violent anti-U.S. and\nanti-Israel groups.  It initiated a military confrontation with Israel in July-August 2006, jeopardizing\nthe long-term stability of Lebanon and complicating U.S.-Lebanese relations.  Between 1996 and\n2004, Hizballah received financial support from a global criminal enterprise operating in Lebanon,\nCanada, China, Brazil, Paraguay, and the U.S. \n\n5\nLebanon suffers from continued political violence and terrorism, threatening the safety and\nsecurity of its own citizens as well as U.S. citizens, especially in the popular districts of Beirut and\nother tourist areas.  Lebanese security forces have been guilty of human rights abuses, and local\nmilitias and non-governmental forces have frequently violated citizens\u2019 privacy rights, used informer\nnetworks, and monitored communications to obtain information about their adversaries.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n6\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  AG\n\u00b6 9.  The SOR alleges Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Lebanon and the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a)\nby possessing an active Lebanese passport (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and using his Lebanese passport to travel to\nand from Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.c).  It also alleges he owns interests in two apartments and a farm in\nLebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.d), maintains a bank account in Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and received money for\neducational expenses from a foundation in Lebanon (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 3.a).\nThe exercise of dual citizenship alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b\nand 1.c.  When the same conduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under the same guideline,\nthe duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704\n(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice).  Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.a in\nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of\nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a\ncurrent foreign passport\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  Applicant\u2019s possession and use of his Lebanese passport\nafter he became a U.S. citizen raises AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  \nA disqualifying condition also may arise from \u201caccepting educational, medical, retirement,\nsocial welfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(3). Applicant\u2019s acceptance\nof educational benefits based on his Lebanese citizenship raises the first prong of this disqualifying\ncondition, but the benefits were conferred by a private foundation, not \u201ca foreign country.\u201d  Thus,\nI conclude AG \u00b6 10(a)(3) is not raised.\nOwnership of property and  having a bank account in a foreign country are not enumerated\ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline, but they may raise a security concern under Guideline\nB, discussed below.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying condition in\nAG \u00b6\u00b610(a)(1), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5\n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual citizenship\nis based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(a).   This mitigating\ncondition is established.\nSecurity concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be mitigated if \u201cthe\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(e).  Applicant admitted at the hearing that he knew his foreign passport raises\nsecurity concerns, but he has done nothing to mitigate those concerns.  He expressed his willingness\nto surrender his passport, but he has not done so.  This mitigating condition is not established.  \n\n7\nTo the extent that Applicant\u2019s acceptance of educational benefits based on his Lebanese\ncitizenship might raise a concern under this guideline, a mitigating condition would apply, because\nhis \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before [he]\nbecame a U.S. citizen.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(c).  His indebtedness to the Lebanese foundation is also a relevant\nconsideration under Guidelines B and F and the whole person analysis, discussed below.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6.  The SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of\nLebanon (SOR \u00b6 2.a); his brother, half sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are\ncitizens and residents of Lebanon (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-d); he owns real estate and a bank account in Lebanon\n(SOR \u00b6 2.e); he received educational benefits from a private foundation in Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 2.f), and\nhe has traveled numerous times to Lebanon and Syria (SOR \u00b6 2.g).\nFour disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, a\ndisqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a\nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Third, a security\nconcern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless\nof citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a\nforeign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693\nat 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  Finally, a security concern also may be raised by \u201ca substantial\nbusiness, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-\noperated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(e).\nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\n\n8\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nAlthough Lebanon and the U.S. have strong ties, Lebanon is a turbulent nation plagued by\nviolence, and it is heavily influenced by Syria, a state sponsor of terrorism.  Thus, Applicant\u2019s ties\nto his siblings and in-laws in Lebanon raise the \u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (d).  His\nfinancial and property interests in Lebanon raise the \u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6 7(e).  Finally, his\nfamily ties to Lebanon raise the \u201cpotential conflict of interest\u201d in AG \u00b6 7(b).  These potentially\ndisqualifying conditions shift the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  Applicant\u2019s siblings and in-laws are not\nconnected to the government or any of the competing political groups in Lebanon.  However, they\nare vulnerable to a heightened risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\nbecause of the volatile political situation in Lebanon and the pervasive influence of Syria and\nterrorist groups supported by Syria.  Accordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).  \u201c[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties\nof affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.\u201d   ISCR Case\nNo. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).  Applicant is estranged from\nhis sister because he disapproves of her husband.  He and his wife have no contact with his father-in-\nlaw.  However, Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty and obligation to his brother, half sister, mother-in-law,\nand brother-in-law  who reside in Lebanon are more than \u201cminimal.\u201d  He has lived in the U.S. since\n1983, but he did not become a citizen until 2002.  He has ties to both the U.S. and Lebanon. His\nfrequent travel to Lebanon, alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g, illustrates the strength of his ties to Lebanon.  I\nconclude he has not carried his burden of proving AG \u00b6 8(b).\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). There is a rebuttable\npresumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a foreign country are not casual.\nISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).  He has not overcome this presumption for\nhis brother and half sister in Lebanon.  He also has regular contact with his mother-in-law and\nbrother-in-law.  I conclude AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established.\n\n9\nFinally, security concerns can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe value or routine nature of\nthe foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a\nconflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d  AG\n\u00b6 8(f).  The value of Applicant\u2019s assets in Lebanon is much less than his assets in the U.S., and they\nproduce no significant income for him  Nevertheless, they are worth more than his annual pay.  I\nconclude AG \u00b6 8(f) is not established.\nThe fact that Applicant\u2019s indebtedness is to a private, non-governmental foundation is not\ndispositive, because the activities of non-governmental organizations can give rise to security\nconcerns.  However, those concerns can be mitigated by the evidence that he is under no legal\nobligation and no pressure to repay it.  The debt is also relevant under Guideline F and the whole\nperson analysis, discussed below.\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG\n\u00b618.  The SOR \u00b6 3.a alleges Applicant is indebted to a private foundation in Lebanon for his\neducational expenses.\nThe evidence reflects that Applicant received loans for educational and living expenses\ntotaling more than $56,000 between January 1987 and January 1990.  There is no evidence the loans\nare delinquent, because there is no due date for repayment.  The foundation has made no effort to\ncollect the debt.  Applicant is not financially overextended, because, with an income of $130,000 per\nyear and assets worth about a million dollars, he has the ability to repay the loans.  No disqualifying\nconditions under this guideline are raised.\n\n10\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Some of these factors are discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, intelligent adult, devoted to his family.  He is aware\nthat his foreign passport and foreign assets raise security concerns, but he has offered only\nexplanations and promises instead of taking positive steps to mitigate or eliminate those concerns.\nHe cannot be faulted for his family ties to Lebanon, but the totality of his family ties and his financial\ninterests in Lebanon make him vulnerable to pressure or coercion.  His indebtedness to the Lebanese\nfoundation arose before he became a U.S. citizen, and it does not make him vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion because there is no pressure to repay the debt.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the applicable guidelines,\nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns based on his indebtedness to the Lebanese foundation, but he has not\nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference and foreign influence.  Accordingly, I\nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline C (Foreign Preference):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline B (Foreign Influence):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3. Guideline F (Financial):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "findings of fact: Applicant was born in Morocco and was solely a Moroccan citizen until she became a naturalized United States citizen in 2004. She also obtained a United States passport in June 2004. Applicant has held an interim security clearance for approximately 18 months, after being hired by her employer without any adverse information being reported. Applicant\u2019s character witnesses, consisting of supervisors and co-workers, consider her to be dependable, professional, diligent, conscientious, detail oriented, and very security conscious. Applicant met her husband, a dual U.S. and Moroccan citizen, while he was visiting in Morocco in the late 1990s. They were married in Morocco. They have two children. Although Applicant testified she considers her children to be solely U.S. citizens, GE 4 indicates that children born to Moroccan fathers are considered by Moroccan law to be citizens of Morocco. Applicant\u2019s husband immigrated to the U.S. sometime in the 1990s after marrying his cousin who was a U.S. citizen. He became a U.S. citizen about nine years ago. Applicant completed her education in Morocco. She has worked for her present employer since 2005. Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Morocco.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJames E. Corl, Jr., Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 28,  2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On November 30, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings were\nnot based upon substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:   Applicant was born in Morocco\nand was solely a Moroccan citizen until she became a naturalized United States citizen in 2004.  She\nalso obtained a United States passport in June 2004.   \nApplicant has  held an interim security clearance for approximately 18 months, after being\nhired by her employer without any adverse information being reported.  Applicant\u2019s character\nwitnesses, consisting of supervisors and co-workers, consider her to be dependable, professional,\ndiligent, conscientious, detail oriented, and very security conscious. \nApplicant met her husband, a dual U.S. and Moroccan citizen, while he was visiting in\nMorocco in the late 1990s.  They were married in Morocco.  They have two children.  Although\nApplicant testified she considers her children to be solely U.S. citizens, GE 4 indicates that children\nborn to Moroccan fathers are considered by Moroccan law to be citizens of Morocco.  Applicant\u2019s\nhusband immigrated to the U.S. sometime in the 1990s after marrying his cousin who was a U.S.\ncitizen.  He became a U.S. citizen about nine years ago.  Applicant completed her education in\nMorocco.  She has worked for her present employer since 2005. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Morocco.  Her father is a retired clerk and\nher mother has never worked outside the home.  They subsist on a pension her father receives, the\nincome from a small business he operates, the $600-700 Applicant sends them annually, and on\nadditional financial assistance provided by her siblings.  Applicant has weekly to bi-weekly\ntelephone contact with her parents and with her sibling who resides with them.  The only asset of any\nvalue owned by her parents is the house in which they live.  Applicant estimated she will inherit\nabout $5,000 as her share of that house when her parents die. \nApplicant has a brother who is a career officer in the Moroccan armed forces.   Applicant has\nadditional siblings  who are citizens and residents of Morocco.  A brother resides in Spain.  Her\nbrothers who reside in Morocco are all employed.  The brother who resides in Spain formerly did\nhome repair work but was unemployed as of the date of the hearing.  One of her siblings resides with\nand cares for Applicant\u2019s elderly parents.  With the exception of the sibling who resides with her\nparents, Applicant has sporadic telephone and/or e-mail contact with her other siblings about once\nevery other month. \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in law are also citizens and residents of Morocco.  They\nare retired and divorced.  Her mother-in-law never worked outside the home and presently is\nsupported by a child who lives with her and her other children who reside in Spain.  Applicant\u2019s\nfather-in-law is retired from a foreign military service other than the Moroccan military.  \nIn addition to the time she resided in Morocco to complete her education, Applicant visited\nthere three times since emigrating to the U.S.  Other than the trip to complete her schooling,\nApplicant\u2019s travels to Morocco were solely for the purpose of visiting relatives. \nApplicant and her husband own a house in the U.S.  She testified the house is not mortgaged\nand is valued at between $30,000 and $40,000.  Her salary is $62,000 annually.  She has money\nwithheld from her pay that is deposited in an educational account for the benefit of her children when\nthey reach age 18.  The only thing Applicant owns in Morocco is a small savings account for her use\nwhen she travels there and which currently has about a $200 balance. \nMorocco is a constitutional monarchy with long-standing ties to the U.S.  It is viewed as\nstable and democratizing.  Terrorist activity has occurred there in recent years.  Additionally, there\nhave been reports of arbitrary arrests; restrictions on freedom of speech, press, etc; lack of judicial\nindependence, and police misconduct.\nIn the Conclusions section of his decision, the Judge noted, inter alia, Applicant\u2019s close ties\nto her family members and in-laws in Morocco, the dual-citizenship status of her husband, and the\nabove-mentioned terrorist activity that has occurred in that country.  The Judge stated that the\nevidence which Applicant presented was not sufficient to overcome the Guideline B security\nconcerns which her case raised.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert.\nth\ndenied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

Corl, Jr., Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s close ties to family members who are citizens and residents of Morocco and her\ntravel to that country create security concerns which she has failed to overcome. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR, which is in\n1\n\n2\nessence the administrative complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline B (foreign\ninfluence). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on March 14,\n2007, admitted all SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on June 12, 2007, and reassigned to\nme on October 2, 2007, due to caseload considerations. A notice of hearing was issued at the request\nof the originally assigned administrative judge on September 26, 2007, scheduling the hearing for\nOctober 30, 2007. I conducted the hearing as it was originally scheduled. \nThe government submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1-6. GE 1and 2 were admitted into the record and administrative notice was taken of\nthe relevant information contained in GE 3-6 without objection. Applicant testified, called five\nwitnesses to testify on her behalf, and submitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-4, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was\nreceived on November 14, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\nA notice of hearing was issued at the request of the administrative judge initially assigned\nto this case on July 20, 2007, scheduling a hearing on September 21, 2007. The file contains a letter\nfrom Applicant\u2019s attorney, dated July 17, 2007 (Appellate Exhibit [App. Ex. I]), indicating he would\nbe representing Applicant and would be available for the hearing date of September 21, 2007. While\nthe file does not contain any other documents to indicate why the hearing was not held on September\n21, 2007, the parties agreed on the record there had been one or more conference calls with the\noriginally assigned administrative judge wherein a continuance was agreed upon to October 30, 2007\n(Tr. pp. 11-12).\nAfter hearing all evidence in this case, on my own motion and without objection by either\nparty, I amended SOR subparagraph 1.b by striking the word \u201cBase\u201d and subparagraph 1.c by\ninserting a comma after the date \u201cMay 2001,\u201d by striking the word \u201cand,\u201d by inserting a comma after\nthe date \u201cSeptember 2004\" and by inserting the phrase \u201cand for three weeks during July to August\n2007.\u201d   \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a\nthorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the following findings of facts.\nApplicant is a married 35-year-old woman. She was born in Morocco and was solely a\nMoroccan citizen until she became a naturalized United States citizen in March 2004. She obtained\na United States passport in June 2004. Applicant returned her previously issued Moroccan passport\nto the Moroccan Consulate General in New York in December 2005, and, at the same time by letter,\nnotified the Consulate General she was immediately renouncing her Moroccan citizenship. Applicant\nrequested confirmation of receipt of the passport from the Consulate General, but never received a\nresponse. \n\n September 1997 is listed in GE 1. September 1999 is listed in GE 2.\n2\n3\nApplicant is employed as an engineer by a defense contractor with skills in a particular field\nthat are difficult to find. Those skills and her experience and knowledge in her field of expertise\nmake her a valuable asset to her employer. She held an interim security clearance for approximately\n18 months after being hired by this employer without any adverse information being reported.\nApplicant\u2019s character witnesses, consisting of supervisors and co-workers, consider her to be\ndependable, professional, diligent, conscientious, detail oriented, and very security conscious. She\nhas proven herself to be a reliable employee with exemplary work habits.\nApplicant met her husband, a dual U.S. and Moroccan citizen, while he was visiting in\nMorocco in 1997. They were married in Morocco in either September 1997 or September 1999.2\nThey have two children, ages six years and 18 months. Although Applicant testified she considers\nher children to be solely U.S. citizens, GE 4 indicates that children born to Moroccan fathers are\nconsidered by Moroccan law to be citizens of Morocco. Applicant\u2019s husband immigrated to the U.S.\nsometime in the 1990s after marrying his cousin who was a U.S. citizen. He became a U.S. citizen\nabout nine years ago. He has been unemployed since October 2004, due to a back injury sustained\nin an automobile accident and receives approximately $620.00 per month as a disability payments.\nHe has used his U.S. passport for travel to Morocco. \nApplicant completed her undergraduate, graduate and doctoral studies in Morocco. She was\nawarded a PhD in electronics from a Moroccan university in April 2001. Although Applicant\nimmigrated to the U.S. in 1999, she returned to Morocco to reside from October 2000 until May\n2001, to complete work on her doctoral degree. She was unemployed from November 2001 until\nJanuary 2002, and worked as a teacher from September 2001 until November 2001. From January\n2002 until May 2005, she worked as an adjunct instructor at a university in the U.S. Applicant has\nworked for her present employer since 2005. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Morocco. Her father is a retired clerk and\nher mother has never worked outside the home. They subsist on a pension her father receives, the\nincome from a small store he operates, the $600.00-700.00 Applicant sends them annually, and on\nadditional financial assistance provided by her siblings. Applicant has weekly to bi-weekly telephone\ncontact with her parents and with her sister who resides with them. The only asset of any value\nowned by her parents is the house in which they live. Applicant estimated she will inherit about\n$5,000.00 as her share of that house when her parents die. \nApplicant has a brother who is career officer in the Moroccan Air Force. His rank is\ncommander and he is stationed at a base in Morocco. Applicant has three additional brothers and two\nsisters who are citizens and residents of Morocco. A fifth brother resides in Spain. Her three brothers\nwho reside in Morocco are all employed as teachers. The brother who resides in Spain formerly did\nhome repair work but was unemployed as of the date of the hearing. One of her sisters resides with\nand cares for Applicant\u2019s elderly parents. The other sister is a teacher. With the exception of the\nsister who resides with her parents, Applicant has sporadic telephone and/or e-mail contact with her\nother siblings about once  every other month. \n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in law are also citizens and residents of Morocco. They\nare retired and divorced. Her mother-in-law never worked outside the home and presently is\nsupported by a son who lives with her and her other children who reside in Spain. Applicant\u2019s father-\nin-law is retired from a foreign military service other than the Moroccan military.  \nIn addition to the time she resided in Morocco to complete work on her doctorate, Applicant\nvisited there from July to September 2000, August to September 2004, and for three weeks from July\nto August 2007. Other than the trip to complete her schooling, Applicant\u2019s travels to Morocco were\nsolely for the purpose of visiting relatives. \nApplicant and her husband own a house in the U.S. She testified the house is not mortgaged\nand is valued at between $30,000.00 and $40,000.00. The house is located in the city where she\npreviously resided and is presently being occupied by a friend. Applicant and her husband live in an\napartment they rent for $735.00 per month. Her salary is $62,000.00 annually. She has money\nwithheld from her pay that is deposited in an educational account for the benefit of her children when\nthey reach age 18. The only thing Applicant owns in Morocco is a small savings account for her use\nwhen she travels there and which currently has about a $200.00 balance. \nThe following information is of record concerning Morocco:\nMorocco is a constitutional monarchy with a Parliament and an independent\njudiciary; however, ultimate authority rests with the king. \n* * * \nA series of terrorist bombings took place in Casablanca on May 16, 2003. Although\nU.S. Government facilities were not the target of the Casablanca attacks (and no\nAmerican were killed or injured), the potential for violence against American\ninterests and citizens remains high in Morocco. In 2006, Moroccan authorities\ndisrupted groups seeking to attack U.S. or Western-affiliated targets, making\nnumerous arrests of individuals associated with international terrorist groups. There\nare indications that such groups still seek to carry out attacks in Morocco. . . . (GE\n4)\nMorocco is a moderate Arab state which maintains close relations with Europe and\nthe United States. . . . It contributes consistently to UN peacekeeping efforts on the\ncontinent.\n* * * \nMorocco was the first Arab state to condemn Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and\nsent troops to help defend Saudi Arabia. . . . Morocco has supported efforts to\nstabilize Iraq following the downfall of Saddam Hussein.\n* * * \n\n5\nMorocco was among the first Arab and Islamic states to denounce the September 11,\n2001 terrorist attacks in the United States and declare solidarity with the American\npeople in the war against terror. \n* * *\nMorocco was the first country to seek diplomatic relations with the Government of\nthe United States in 1777, and remains one of our oldest and closest allies in the\nregion. . . . As testament to the special nature of the U.S.-Moroccan relationship,\nTangier is home to the oldest U.S. diplomatic property in the world, and the only\nbuilding on foreign soil that is listed in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places,\nthe American Legation in Tangier (now a museum).\nU.S.-Moroccan relations, characterized by mutual respect and friendship, have\nremained strong through cooperation and sustained high-level dialogue. King Hassan\nII visited the United States several times during his reign as King, meeting with\nPresidents Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton. King Mohammed\nVI has continued his father\u2019s tradition; he made his first trip to the U.S. as King on\nJune 20, 2000. Prime Minister Jettou visited Washington in January 2004, and King\nMohammed came to the United States in July 2004. . . .\nAs a stable, democratizing, and liberalizing Arab Muslim nation, Morocco is\nimportant for U.S. interests in the Middle East. Accordingly, U.S. policy toward\nMorocco seeks sustained and strong engagement, and identifies priorities for reform,\nconflict resolution, counterterrorism cooperation, and public outreach. (GE 3)\nCitizens did not have the right to change fully their form of government. Reports of\ntorture by various branches of the security forces persisted. Prison conditions\nremained below international standards. Reports of arbitrary arrests, incommunicado\ndetentions, and police and security force impunity continued. Judicial independence\nfrom the executive branch of the government remained a problem. The government\nrestricted freedoms of speech, press, and religion. Trafficking in persons continued,\nand child labor, particularly in the unregulated and informal sector, remained a\nproblem. Security forces disbanded, sometimes with excessive force, monthly\ndemonstrations by unemployed university graduates in front of the parliament. (GE\n6)\n \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be\na fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the\nDirective. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v.

The government has\n3\nthe burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\n4\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence,  although the government is required to present\n5\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\n6\nless than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden\n7\nshifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the\ncase against her.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n8\nfavorable clearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n10\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n11\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\n\n7\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\nSecurity clearance decisions are not based upon loyalty determinations. Instead, the issue is\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance in a particular\ncase. No suggestion has been made that Applicant is anything but a loyal, honorable, and faithful\nAmerican citizen. No assertion has been made that her foreign relatives or in-laws have any intention\nof performing any act that could cause harm to the United States. However, the analysis does not\nstop there.\nApplicant met her husband, a dual U.S. and Moroccan citizen, while he was visiting in\nMorocco in 1997. They were married in Morocco, in either 1997 or 1999. Applicant immigrated to\nthe United States in 1999, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2004, and obtained a U.S.\npassport in June 2004. She has two minor children who are dual U.S. and Moroccan citizens based\nupon their father\u2019s Moroccan citizenship. Although Applicant has surrendered her Moroccan\npassport and attempted to renounce her Moroccan citizenship, she has not received the confirmation\nshe requested that the passport was received and accepted. \nApplicant completed her undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral studies in Morocco. After\nimmigrating to the United States, Applicant returned to Morocco from October 2000 to May 2001\nto complete work on her doctorate. Additionally, she vacationed and visited with relatives in\nMorocco from July to September 2000, August to September 2004, and for three weeks during July\nto August 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, mother-in-law, father-in-law, four brothers and two sisters are\ncitizens and residents of Morocco. One of her brothers is a senior career officer in the Moroccan Air\nForce who is stationed at an air base in Morocco. Her father-in-law is retired from another foreign\nmilitary service. Applicant has frequent and regular telephonic contact with her parents and a sister\nwho resides with the parents. She has less frequent and somewhat irregular telephonic and/or e-mail\ncontact with her other siblings. Applicant sends her parents between $600.00 and $700.00 annually.\nApplicant\u2019s husband has been unemployed for several years due to an injury sustained in an\nautomobile accident. She held two teaching jobs and experienced a short period of unemployment\nbefore being hired by a defense contractor in 2005. Applicant quickly gained a reputation for being\na valued and trusted employee with the defense contractor and has impressed her supervisors and\nco-workers with her work ethic and security consciousness. \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is $62,000.00. Her husband receives about $620.00 monthly as a\ndisability payment. Applicant and her husband own a house in the U.S. that she values at somewhere\nbetween $30,000.00 and $40,000.00. They do not reside in the house but instead have a friend living\nthere while they pay rent in the amount of $735.00 per month for an apartment in which they reside.\nApplicant has some savings from payroll withholdings in an educational account she established for\nthe benefit of her children. Applicant maintains a savings account in Morocco for her use while\nvisiting there that currently has a small balance of about $200.00.   \n\n8\nThe record is devoid of any information to indicate the government of Morocco has in the\npast or will in the future target U.S. interests or U.S. citizens for purposes of data collection or in any\nother way inimical to U.S. security interests. However, the same cannot be said for terrorist and/or\nother anti-American organizations operating within Morocco. As recently as 2006, groups seeking\nto attack U.S. or Western-affiliated targets were found to be operating in Morocco. The U.S. State\nDepartment has noted: \u201cThere are indications that such groups still seek to carry out attacks in\nMorocco.\u201d (GE 4)  \nAs a result, Applicant\u2019s close ties to her relatives and in-laws who are citizens and residents\nof Morocco, and her repeated travel to Morocco raise security concerns under disqualifying\nconditions 7(a): contact with a foreign family member . . .who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion; 7(d): sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion; and 7(I): conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make\nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country.\nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. less than ten years ago and has only within the past four\nyears become a U.S. citizen. She has traveled back to Morocco on several occasions since\nimmigrating to the U.S. and after becoming a U.S. citizen. She may or may not still be considered\nby Morocco to be a Moroccan citizen. Her husband and children are dual citizens of the U.S. and\nMorocco. Applicant\u2019s relationship with her parents and at least some of her siblings is obviously\nclose as evidenced by her frequent contact with them and her travels with her husband and children\nto Morocco to spend time with them. Thus, mitigating conditions 8(a): the nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, . . . are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual . . . and the interests of the U.S.; 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person . . . is so minimal, or the individual\nhas such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and 8(c): contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation do not apply. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept\nrecognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be\nadjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound\njudgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant has failed to present sufficient evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, and mitigation to overcome the case against her. Accordingly, Guideline\nB is decided against Applicant.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline B:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraphs a-d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

WHITE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff A. Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (August 2006) as\n1\nimplemented by Under Secretary of Defense Memorandum of Aug. 30, 2006 for use in adjudication of all cases in which\nan SOR had not been issued by Sept 1, 2006. These revised AG replaced those found in enclosure 2 of the Directive,\nwhich is pending revision to incorporate them. Copies of the applicable AG were provided to Applicant with the SOR.\n \n2\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has been convicted of\ndisturbing the peace, battering his wife, DWI, and violating a domestic violence protective order. He\ndeliberately omitted another arrest for threatening his wife, for which charges were dropped, from\nhis security clearance application. He did not mitigate security concerns raised by his criminal and\npersonal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on June 13, 2006, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor. On March 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR detailed reasons, under\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG),  why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\n1\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for\nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter dated April 10, 2007,\nadmitting the truth of some of the factual allegations, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. On May 15, 2007, the case was assigned to another administrative judge. The\ncase was  reassigned to me on May 17, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on June 6, 2007, and\nthe hearing was held as scheduled on June 26, 2007. The Government offered two exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and admitted without objection. Applicant testified,\nand offered one exhibit at the hearing, but withdrew it for later submission because it was his only\ncopy. At his request, and without objection, the record was kept open to permit his submission of\ncourt documents and letters of reference. These were received by Department Counsel on July 24,\n2007, forwarded for admission without objection, and received on July 30, 2007. These documents\nwere marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F, and admitted. AE A is a more complete version\nof the four pages of court documents originally tendered during the hearing. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr) on July 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nGE 1 (Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), dated Jun. 13, 2006) at 1, 4-5; AE A and B; Tr at 22, 45,\n2\n49-50.\nGE 2 (FBI Identification Record, dated Jun. 25, 2006) at 1; Applicant\u2019s Response (AR) to SOR at 2; Tr at 37-\n3\n38, 48-50.\nGE 2 at 1; AR to SOR at 2; Tr at 35-37.\n4\n3\nApplicant admitted the truth of the factual allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d,\nand 1.e, with some explanations, pertaining to criminal conduct under AG J. Those admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied falsifying material facts concerning his criminal\nhistory on his security clearance application as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. After complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was divorced from his first\nwife in December 1992, began living with his second wife in 1993, and married her in July 1998.\nAfter a series of domestic disputes and temporary separations, they finally separated in April 2005.\nTheir divorce is still pending. Applicant was recently awarded physical custody of their nine-year-old\nson.  His second wife is now residing in Arizona with her two teenage daughters. Applicant has\n2\nanother son and daughter who are adults, living independently.\nOn May 3, 1992, in connection with his separation from his first wife, Applicant was arrested\nfor contempt of court and disobeying a court order. He admitted the arrest, but said he cannot recall\ndetails of the incident. Due to the timing, he thinks this resulted from an altercation with his then-\nbrother-in-law. He was convicted of misdemeanor disturbing the peace, and fined.  There is no\n3\nevidence concerning the nature of the court order he was charged with disobeying, or why an\naltercation with his wife\u2019s brother would violate it.\nOn March 10, 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with inflicting corporal injury on\na spouse or cohabitant. He was convicted of the lesser offense of battery of a cohabitant, and\nsentenced to probation and a fine.  He successfully completed a one-year anger management class.\n4\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant explained:\nI admit the arrest on 10 March 1997 charged with Inflict Corporal Injury on\nSpouse/Cohab. with explanation. During an argument, while unloading the\ndishwasher, my wife accidentally hit her head on a cabinet door. She used this\naccident to convince the authorities of abuse. Unfortunately, I did not have the\nresources to fight the charge. My wife rescinded the allegation, the District Attorney\npressed charges. I did a year of weekends at an anger management course.\nHe described the incident somewhat differently during the hearing, as follows:\nThis was an evening, I had just gotten home from work and had gone and took a\nshower. We were arguing, continuing arguing from the day before and I went and like\nI said I took a shower. Came out of the shower she was still arguing, still continuing\nthis argument. She was unloading the dishwasher at the time, I happened to reach up\nin the cupboard to get a glass and as I turned to close the cabinet, she put glasses or\n\nTr at 35-36.\n5\nGE 1 at 9; AR to SOR at 2; Tr at 33-34.\n6\nGE 2 at 1; AR to SOR at 2; Tr at 31-33, 45-48, 51-52.\n7\nGE 2 at 1; AR to SOR at 1; Tr at 25-31, 45.\n8\n4\ncups or plates, I can\u2019t remember what they were, but bowls and plates and something\nin the cupboard and I went to close it and it hit her on the side \u2013 on the side of her \u2013\nand pushed her glasses. So anyway she called the police. \nHe went on to testify that he did not intend to hit her with the door and she suffered no injuries.5\nOn October 31, 1998, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated. He had been out\nwith friends and estimated he consumed about five drinks, comprising cocktails and beers. He could\nnot remember his blood alcohol level. He was convicted, paid a $500 fine, and paid $1,500 for a\nyear-long DUI school.  After completing the school, he received a restricted Class B driver\u2019s license\nwith a reduced, 0.04 alcohol limit, which he still holds.6\nApplicant was arrested for violation of a domestic violence protective order on May 17, 2003.\nThe case was not prosecuted by the district attorney. Applicant and his wife were separated at the\ntime, and a domestic violence protective order was in effect. He was living with his parents, and she\nhad moved into an apartment across the street. Applicant went out to dinner with his two older\nchildren, and his wife came into the restaurant where they were eating. When she left, she used her\nspare keys and took his Ford Expedition, which they discovered to be missing when they departed.\nApplicant reported the missing vehicle to the police, who found it at her apartment. Applicant\nrecovered the vehicle, and later that evening saw his wife as their paths crossed when he was pulling\ninto his parking space. She called the police and reported him for violating the protective order. After\nhis arrest, he was held for a couple of hours then made bail. The charge was dismissed without\nprosecution during a subsequent court appearance. Applicant did not explain what prompted the\nprotective order, but it evidently had to do with their ongoing separation at the time.  \n7\nA month or two after this arrest, Applicant\u2019s wife moved across the country with her\ndaughters and their son. Three or four months after that, in late 2003, they moved back and the\nfamily \u201cgot back together.\u201d This lasted until the night of April 28, 2005, when he and his wife argued\nagain. She called the police and told them he had threatened her. Applicant was arrested for\nthreatening to commit a crime with intent to terrorize, and taken to jail. He said that  a no-contact\norder was issued while he was in custody but without his knowledge. His subsequent conviction for\nviolating a domestic violence protective order purportedly resulted from making a phone call to his\nhome to speak to one of his older step-children about getting his parents to help him, not from the\nargument that led to his original arrest. He pled guilty, through counsel, to violating the order, was\nfined $300 and placed on three years unsupervised probation which he is still serving. The\nunderlying threat charge was dismissed when he pled guilty to violating the order. He left the house\nafter this incident, and has been separated from his wife ever since. He said he forgot to pay the fine,\nwhich resulted in a bench warrant being issued. When he found out about the warrant, he paid the\nfine in full and it was rescinded.   \n8\n\nGE 2 at 8-9; AR to SOR at 2; Tr at 41-43.\n9\nAG \u00b6 2.\n10\n5\nWhen Applicant completed the Police Record portion of his security clearance application,\nhe listed his 1998 DWI conviction and sentence. He also listed his 2005 arrest for \u201cdomestic dispute\nwith wife,\u201d but reported that the charges were dropped. He did not report his conviction and sentence\nfor violating the protective order. This omission was not alleged in the SOR, however.  He also did\nnot list his 2003 arrest for violation of a protective order, after which the charge was dismissed. This\nomission forms the basis of the SOR allegation under AG E. He said he omitted this arrest\ninadvertently, believed all the charges were dropped, and forgot all about the incident. He denied\nintentionally omitting the information in order to deceive the government.9\n \nApplicant submitted four letters of recommendation from friends and coworkers, in which\nthey spoke highly of his integrity, trustworthiness and good work performance. Several also\nconfirmed his frequent troubles in his turbulent second marriage, stating that he tried to make it work\nfor the sake of the children and because he values family, but his wife continued causing problems.\nPOLICIES            \nThe revised AG that replaced Enclosure 2 of the Directive set forth adjudicative guidelines\nwhich must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions\n(DC) that may raise security concerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate\nsecurity concerns. Applicable DCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant,\ncontinue, deny or revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Conditions\nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate\nsecurity concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n10\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\nId., at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n11\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n12\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n13\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n15\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n6\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\n11\non the evidence contained in the record were drawn, and no inferences were grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n12\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n13\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n14\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n15\nA person seeking access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship that\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section\n7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial security clearance\ndecision shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned,\u201d so the decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication the applicant\n\nAG \u00b6 30.\n16\n7\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs set forth in the Directive, every recommended personnel security decision must be a fair\nand impartial overall common sense decision based on all available evidence, both favorable and\n unfavorable.  The decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant or continuance\nof a security clearance or access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.  \nCriminal Conduct\n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations.\u201d   Three Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) raise security\n16\nconcerns under the facts and circumstances established by the evidence in this case. \nCC DC 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) applies because Applicant\nhas been convicted of DWI, two assaults related to domestic disputes, and violating a court\nprotective order. These offenses spanned the period from 1992 to 2005. Each of these offenses\nreflected an absence of self-control, poor judgment, and inability to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.\nCC DC 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted\u201d) applies as Applicant admitted to the\nforgoing convictions, and to being arrested for additional verbal fights with his wife for which the\ncharges were dropped.   \nCC DC 31(d) (\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation\u201d) also applies.  Applicant\u2019s\nthree years of unsupervised probation, imposed as part of the sentence for his 2005 conviction, runs\nthrough sometime in 2008. There is no information that would cause any other CC DC to apply.\nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since\nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d)\ndoes not apply.  Applicant\u2019s conduct  casts significant doubt on his reliability and good judgment.\nHe continued to fight with his wife despite multiple interventions by law enforcement, and after\ncompleting a court-ordered anger management class following his 1997 assault conviction. This\nmost recent offense was just over two years ago, and he is still serving probation for it. Although\ntheir separation makes recurrence of domestic violence less likely, the multiple offenses, including\na DWI, continue to cast doubt on his judgment and reliability.\n\nAG \u00b6 15.\n17\n\u201cI inadvertently left out [SOR \u00b6] 1(b), the arrest in 2003. The District Attorney rejected the case as the facts\n18\ndid not substantiate the charge. I believed all charges were dropped an forgot all about the incident.\u201d\n8\nCC MC 32(b) (\u201cthe person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and\nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life\u201d), applies to partially mitigate some of\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct. His wife was at least equally culpable for their domestic disputes, and\nthey have been separated, pending divorce, since 2005. However, his 1992 conviction arose out of\na different marriage-related dispute, he is now a single parent of a soon-to-be teenager, and he will\ncontinue to face family pressures and concerns. There is no evidence that his relationship with his\nson is anything but good, but Applicant has not demonstrated that he has developed adequate coping\nskills when faced with family issues. Moreover, security concerns arising from his DWI conviction\nare not mitigated by this factor. \nCC MC 32(c) (\u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense\u201d) applies in part as well,\nbut cuts both ways. Applicant admitted that he did commit the DWI offense. He admits to arguing\nbut says he did not commit the threat offenses for which he was arrested, but not convicted, in 2003\nand 2005. He said he didn\u2019t know about the protective order he pled guilty to violating in 2005. He\nclaims the spousal assault to which he pled no contest was accidental, and couldn\u2019t remember the\ncircumstances of his 1992 conviction. His minimization of his own culpability and selective memory\nare not persuasive of his innocence, but instead reflect failure to take responsibility for his actions.\nThis is not mitigating of criminal conduct security concerns.   \nFinally, CC MC 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\u201d)\ndoes not apply. He was arrested twice more in connection with domestic disputes after his court-\nordered anger management class. Only two years has passed since his last conviction for violating\na court order, and he offered no other evidence of rehabilitation.\nPersonal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d17\nApplicant omitted relevant facts concerning his 2003 arrest for violating a protective order\nfrom his security clearance application, but listed his 2005 arrest and his 1998 DWI conviction.\nDepartment Counsel submitted sufficient circumstantial evidence that the omission was deliberate\nto shift the burden of persuasion to Applicant. This evidence includes Applicant\u2019s internally\ncontradictory explanation in his response to the SOR, and his testimony that he was in jail for\n18\nseveral hours after the arrest and had to make a separate court appearance at which the charges were\ndismissed. Applicant further demonstrated his understanding that an arrest should be disclosed even\nif charges are subsequently dismissed when he falsely reported \u201ccharges were dropped\u201d as the action\n\nGE 1 at 8. Note that he is still on probation from the resulting conviction.\n19\nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n20\n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving\nfalsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge\nto conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden\nof persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission. \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9,\n2004)).\n9\ntaken after his 2005 arrest.  After what he described as years of ongoing domestic disputes in which\n19\nhis wife regularly involved police authorities, he chose to disclose one offense described as\n\u201cdomestic dispute with wife,\u201d and \u201caction taken: charges were dropped.\u201d His denial that the\nomission of the 2003 arrest was intentional is not persuasive. Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d) is established by the\nevidence in this record.   No other PC DC applies. Applicant neither asserted, nor provided any\n20\nevidence to support application of, any personal conduct mitigating conditions. None are applicable.\nWhole Person Analysis \nI have considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability\nin protecting our national interests. His 15-year pattern of sporadic criminal behavior, including a\nDWI and battering his spouse, raises serious concerns about his judgment, self-control, and\nwillingness and ability to follow laws, rules and regulations. He is mature and fully accountable for\nhis choices. \nThe omission of one arrest from his security clearance application, in light of his false report\nconcerning the outcome of his subsequent arrest for a similar offense, was deliberately deceptive.\nThis raises serious security concerns, particularly in light of his ongoing minimization of culpability\nand failure to admit responsibility for his misconduct. \nSecurity concerns in this case rest not so much on potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation or duress, but more on Applicant\u2019s  reliability, judgment and ability to conform behavior\nto required norms.  Accordingly, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his\ncriminal conduct or personal conduct, so it is not clearly in the interest of national security to grant\nhim access to classified material.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \n            Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

ROSS\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant has considerable connections with Thailand.  His wife is a citizen of Thailand,\nhis father is a retired senior officer in the Thai military, his in laws live in Thailand, and two of his\nchildren currently attend school there.  He failed to submit sufficient evidence showing that he has\nan unequivocal connection to the United States.  The Applicant is not currently eligible for a security\nclearance.  Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on July 10, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on August 21, 2007.  The case was received\nby the undersigned on August 23, 2007, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on September 6, 2007.\nA hearing was held on September 25, 2007, at which the Government presented two\ndocumentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted one exhibit.\nThe Government also requested that Administrative Notice be taken of certain adjudicative facts\nabout the Kingdom of Thailand.  The request for Administrative Notice is marked Administrative\nJudge Exhibit I, and the documents attached to the request are marked as Administrative Judge\nExhibits I(1) through I(4).  The transcript was received on October 5, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE \nAt the conclusion of the evidence, the Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to\ncomport with the evidence.  Subparagraph 1.c. was amended to read, \u201cYour spouse is a citizen of\nThailand.\u201d  Subparagraph 1.e. was amended to read, \u201cTwo of your five half-siblings are citizens and\nresidents of Thailand.\u201d  A new subparagraph 1.i. was added to the SOR stating, \u201cYour two sons\ncurrently attend school in Thailand.\u201d  The Applicant admitted these amended subparagraphs.\n(Transcript at 102-108.)\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 48, married with three children, and has a Master of Science degree.  He\nis employed by a defense contractor as an engineer, and he seeks to retain a Secret-level DoD\nsecurity clearance previously granted in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based\nupon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are\nentered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer\nto the SOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to\nthe exercise of poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\n\nSubparagraph 1.d. as amended above, states that the Applicant has five half-siblings.  That is\n1\nincorrect.  \n3\nThe Applicant was born in Thailand in 1959.  He emigrated from Thailand in 1976 when his\nAmerican step-father, who was in the American military, returned to the United States with the\nApplicant\u2019s mother and family.  The Applicant became a naturalized American citizen in November\n1985.  His wife was also born in Thailand.  She is a Permanent Resident Alien in the United States.\nThey were married in 1991, and have three children.  All the children were born in Thailand, but the\nApplicant has filed the certification with the State Department declaring that they are American\nchildren born abroad.  (Government Exhibit 1, Transcript at 48-49.)  The Applicant and his wife\nhave over $2,000,000 in assets in the United States.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 4.) \nThe Applicant has one brother, two half-brothers and five half-sisters.  His brother, two half-\nbrothers and one half-sister are American citizens.  The Applicant does not know the citizenship\nstatus of two of his half-sisters who were born in Thailand of American fathers but live in the United\nStates.  Two of his half-sisters, one on each side of his family, are citizens of Thailand and reside\nthere.   (Transcript at 68-84.)\n1\nThe Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens of Thailand and reside there.\nThey are both retired and are independently wealthy.  The Applicant, his wife and children have a\nclose relationship with her parents.  (Transcript at 61-66.) \nThe Applicant and his wife lived in Thailand between 1991 and 1997.  They were newly\nmarried, the Applicant had been laid off by his job in the United States, and the Applicant\u2019s wife\nwanted to be close to her family.  The Applicant withdrew the assets from his 401(k) plan before\nmoving to Thailand so that they would have money.  After they moved to Thailand, his in-laws\nfinancially assisted the Applicant and his wife in founding and running a computer company in\nThailand.  The company was not financially successful and, after draining their assets, including the\nmoney from his 401(k), the Applicant made the decision to return to the United States in 1997 to find\nwork.  (Transcript at 38-43.)\nThe Applicant unintentionally did not have taxes withheld from his 401(k) funds when he\nwithdrew them in 1991.  When he returned to live and work in the United States in 1997, the IRS\nfiled a tax lien and garnished his wages to pay the back taxes, interest and penalties.  The Applicant\nworked overtime for about a year and was able to pay off the back taxes.  The lien was released in\n1998.  (Transcript at 27-30.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s two older children are attending school in Thailand as of the date the record\nclosed.  They have been in Thailand since December 2006 and are due to return to the United States\nin March 2008.  During most of this time the Applicant\u2019s wife and youngest child have also been in\nThailand.  When his wife is in Thailand, he speaks to her every day.  (Transcript at 90-93.)  \nIn addition to the times when the Applicant and/or his family have lived in Thailand, they\nhave traveled there at least four additional times on extended trips.  These trips occurred annually\nbetween December 2002 and August 2006.  (Transcript at 87-90.)\n\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department\n2\nCounsel in support of her request for administrative notice.  (Administrative Judge Exhibit I and\nattachments.)\n4\nThe Applicant\u2019s biological father is a retired brigadier general in the Royal Thai Army.  The\nApplicant was unsure of his father\u2019s position, but it appears to be related to the medical field.  The\nApplicant testified that he was closer to his late American step-father than he is to his father.\n(Transcript at 98-101.)  The Applicant, however, does have a relationship with his father.  They\ncommunicate by telephone several times a year.  When the Applicant travels to Thailand, which he\ndoes on about a yearly basis, he stays with his father for several days.  His father knows the\nApplicant works in the defense industry and that he has a security clearance.  (Transcript at 52-61.)\nDuring his testimony, the Applicant expressed considerable support for the military coup that\ntoppled the elected civilian government in Thailand in 2006.  (Transcript at 21-23.)  The coup, and\nother pertinent matters involving Thailand, will be discussed immediately below.\nThe Applicant has many contacts with Thailand.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to discuss the\nsituation in Thailand at this time.   The Kingdom of Thailand is a constitutional monarchy.  The\n2\ncurrent ruler is treated with deep reverence and respect.  On September 19, 2006, the current ruling\nregime came to power through a bloodless coup, whereby military leaders overthrew the\ndemocratically elected Prime Minister.  The coup leaders, now called the Council for National\nSecurity, assert that the Prime Minister was corrupt and that the last election was fraudulent.  In the\nfollowing months they abolished Parliament, declared martial law, and issued decrees limiting civil\nliberties including limits on free speech, free press and freedom of assembly.\nThailand has a free-enterprise economy with a well-developed infrastructure, and pro-\ninvestment policies.  Approximately 40% of Thailand\u2019s labor force is agricultural, with rice being\nthe most important crop.  It also has an increasingly diversified manufacturing sector.  The United\nStates is Thailand\u2019s largest export market and second largest supplier.\nIn the past, Thailand had excellent military relations with the United States, including joint\ntraining and maneuvers.  In addition, Thailand cooperated with the United States on a wide variety\nof foreign policy issues, including the Global War on Terror.  However, as a result of the military\ncoup in September 2006, the United States suspended Foreign Military Financing, International\nMilitary Training funds, and peace-keeping operation funds with Thailand.\nThe United States Government, through the State Department, has criticized the Thai\ngovernment\u2019s overall human rights record for several years.  Prior to the coup, the Thai constitution\nprohibited such practices as torture and arbitrary arrest and detention.  However, instances of\ndisappearances, torture, arbitrary arrests and detentions have been reported under past and present\nThai regimes.  The Emergency Decree and martial law orders in effect since the coup permit\nauthorities to conduct searches without a warrant.  Further, despite constitutional protections\nafforded to freedom of speech and the press, the coup leaders have suspended these rights and have\nbanned articles, messages, speeches and any other type of discourse that could undermine the coup.\n\n5\nFinally, Thailand\u2019s southern provinces continue to be the source of sectarian violence\nbetween Muslim insurgents and Thai security forces.  While the extremist groups primarily focus\non Thai government interests in the south, recent violence has also targeted public places, including\ntourist areas.\nMitigation.\nThe Applicant submitted several letters from co-workers and supervisors.  He is described\nby these people as a loyal, intelligent, trustworthy and reliable friend and colleague.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n\n6\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may have foreign contacts and interests that may lead to poor judgement,\nuntrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has foreign connections which could cause a security concern (Guideline B).\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has not successfully mitigated the Government's case,\nexcept in part.  Subparagraph 1.g. is found for the Applicant as I find it has no current security\nsignificance.\nThe Applicant has many and varied connections to Thailand on both sides of his family.  The\nApplicant obviously loves his late American step-father and considers this man his real father.\n\n7\nHowever, he is not estranged from his father, a retired general in the Thai Army.  Their relationship\nmay not be particularly close, but the fact remains that he stays at his father\u2019s house and talks to him\non the phone several times a year.  In addition, there is the extremely close relationship the\nApplicant, his wife, and his children have with his in-laws.  As described above, two of the\nApplicant\u2019s children are currently attending school in Thailand.  The Applicant and his wife also\nlived in Thailand for six years after he lost his job in 1991, where his in-laws provided the Applicant\nand his wife considerable financial assistance.  \nAll of these connections must also be viewed in the context of the current Thai government,\nand its strained relations with the United States after the coup.  The Applicant certainly has a right\nto indicate his support for the coup, but that support must also be considered in determining whether\nhe should have a security clearance at this time.  To his credit, the Applicant repeatedly stated that\nhe is a loyal American citizen, that he understands his responsibilities as a security clearance holder,\nand that he would bear arms against Thailand if necessary.  However, given the depth and extent of\nhis current connections with Thailand, he has failed to meet his burden of showing an unequivocal\nconnection to the United States.  He is not eligible for a security clearance at the present time.\nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following Disqualifying Conditions\napply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member . . . who is a citizen of or resident in\na foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b) connections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology\nand the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information; and (d)\nsharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  I have also\nconsidered the information concerning the current Thai government, which came to power through\na military coup, provided by Department Counsel in Administrative Judge\u2019s Exhibit I and its\nattachments I(1) through I(4). \nThe Applicant has not provided compelling evidence to show that the following Mitigating\nConditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background:  7(a) the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.; and (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because\nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country\nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the\nU.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\n \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence\nsupports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H.

Hancock, Esquire\n                            \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,  I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information must be granted.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 21,\n2006. On January 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F, E\nand J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 22, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing through counsel on February 1, 2008, and requested a hearing\nJune 17, 2008\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated March 21, 2006) at 1, 7, 20-22; GE 2 (Interrogatories\n1\nand answers) at 5; Tr. 34-35.\n2\nbefore an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on the same day.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 20, 2008, and I received the\ncase assignment on February 27, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 24,\n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 30, 2008. The government\noffered eight exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted three exhibits (AE)\nA through C, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 9, 2008. I granted the government\u2019s\nrequest to keep the record open to submit additional matters. I also requested additional\nevidence from Applicant. On May 2, 2008, the government submitted one additional\nexhibit which has been received and admitted as GE 9, without objection. On  May 13,\n2008, Applicant submitted two additional exhibits, which have been received and\nadmitted as AE D and AE E, without objection. The record closed on May 15, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding the following language\nto \u00b6 1.b: \u201cAs of April 5, 2006, this debt had not been paid.\u201d and adding a new allegation\nas \u00b6 1.f, alleging \u201cYou are indebted to {debtor} on an account that has been charged off\nin the amount of $924 since about June 2000. As of April 5, 2006, this debt had not\nbeen paid.\u201d Applicant denied the allegation, but did not object to the motion, which I\ngranted. The SOR is amended as requested. (Tr. at 11.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 1, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegation in \u00b6 2.a of the SOR, with explanation. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a through 1.f, and 3.a of the SOR.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old corporate security manager for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1981 and retired on\npermanent disability in 2000 as a sergeant first class (pay grade E-7). While in the\nArmy, he held a top secret -  Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearance,\nwithout any violations or allegations of violation of the rules and procedures for his\nclearance level.1\nApplicant married his first wife in October 1990. Their daughter is 16 years old.\nThey divorced in November 1999, and his daughter lives with her mother. He pays\n\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 11-20.\n2\nGE 3 (Second set of Interrogatories and Answers) at 3; GE 8 (State Criminal Records) at 1; AE C (May 24,\n3\n2004 Order) at 1; Tr. 53-61.\nGE 3, supra note 3, at 3-5; Tr. 36-39. \n4\nGE 3, supra note 3, attachments; GE 4 (Experian credit report); GE 5 (Equifax credit report); GE 6 (Equifax\n5\nCredit report); AE B (April 2008 credit report).\n3\nregular monthly child support. He married his present wife in November 2000. They\nhave a four-year-old daughter.2\n            In 2003, Applicant and his wife argued after a long day when they were both\ntired and stressed. His wife threatened to call the police and he told her \u201cfine\u201d. She\ncalled 911 then hung up without speaking to the operator. Thirty minutes later the police\narrived at their house. Under the state\u2019s no tolerance law for domestic violence, the\npolice advised that one of them would be arrested and taken to jail. Applicant\nvolunteered. The police arrested him and he spent 24 hours in jail. At subsequent court\nproceedings two weeks later, the prosecutor asked the court to dismiss the charges,\nwhich the court did. Applicant requested his attorney to seek expungement of his\ncriminal record. His criminal attorney filed a petition to seal his arrest and criminal\nrecord. The court granted the motion and ordered that his records be sealed on May 24,\n2004. Thereafter, because of a concern about the impact of his arrest in the future,\nApplicant asked his criminal attorney what information, if any, he must reveal about his\narrest if asked. His criminal attorney advised that since his record had been expunged\n(sealed), his arrest did not exist. The expungement meant that his arrest never\nhappened.3\nApplicant currently earns approximately $75,000 a year. His wife works as a real\nestate broker and earns between $90,000 and $180,000 a year. At his security\ninvestigation interview in August 2006, he listed his gross monthly income at $4,000 and\nhis net monthly income at $3,350 plus $1,700 a month in military retirement. His\nmonthly expenses, including mortgage, utilities, food, car payment, and child support,\ntotal approximately $5,000. He and his wife keep their finances separate, so the full\nextent of household income and expenses is not known. In August 2006, a security\nclearance investigator interviewed Applicant. Until one hour before this interview,\nApplicant did not know he had unpaid debts.   \n4\nThe record contains six credit reports with conflicting information. The\ngovernment submitted three credit reports prepared by two of the credit reporting\nagencies, dated April 5, 2006 (Equifax), December 14, 2006 (Experian), and June 29,\n2007 (Equifax).  In his response to the second set of interrogatories, Applicant provided\n5\ntwo credit reports, one from Equifax, dated September 26, 2007 and one from Experian,\ndated September 27, 2007. Applicant submitted a credit report from all three credit\nreporting agencies, dated April 10, 2008. Applicant\u2019s credit report submissions reflect a\nvery good credit history and do not contain the debts listed in the SOR. The April 5,\n\nId.\n6\nGE, 3, attachments; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; AE E (Letter, dated May 6, 2008); Tr. 39-40.\n7\nApplicant might have received a response if he had put his dispute in writing.\n8\nGE 3 attachments; GE 4 at 2, 7; GE 5 at 1; GE 6 at 1; AE B at 4. \n9\n4\n2006 Experian credit report shows all the debts listed in the SOR and the December 14,\n2006 Equifax credit report lists many of the debts in the SOR, but not all. The June 29,\n2007 Experian credit report lists only the debt identified in \u00b6 1.c of the SOR. Except for\nthe April 2008 credit report, all the credit reports contain a credit history for Applicant for\nat least 10 years. The June 2007 and September 2007 Experian credit report\ninformation conflicts with the information contained in the April 2006 Experian credit\nreport. Likewise, the September 2006 Equifax credit report information conflicts  with the\nDecember 2006 Equifax credit report information. The reason for the conflicting\ninformation is not clear or explained.6\n \nBased on this evidence of record and Applicant\u2019s testimony, I make the following\nfinding of facts. The debt contained in allegation \u00b6 1.a belongs to Applicant. He states\nthat he paid the debt, but has not provided proof of his debt. The letter from a creditor,\ndated May 6, 2008, does not provide information indicating the account number, the\namount owed and paid, and the original creditor; thus, it is insufficient to show payment\nfo this debt. The debt alleged in allegation \u00b6 1.b is listed in the April 5, 2006 credit report\nonly. Two other accounts with this creditor are paid and timely.7\nAfter a careful review of the credit reports, I find that the allegations \u00b6 1. c and \u00b6\n1.e are the same debt. Originally, the debt belonged to a bank. It totaled $3,674 and\nbecame delinquent in June 2000. Based on the amount of the debt,  in April 2001, the\noriginal bank sold the debt to another bank (P.F.), which assigned a new account\nnumber to the debt. Based on this account number, bank P.F. sold the account to bank\n3, which sold the account to the current debt holder in November 2006. A letter from the\ncurrent creditor (identified in allegation \u00b6 1.e) contains the account number of the\noriginal creditor, but refers back to the third bank purchaser. The debt now totals\n$6,982, without an explanation for the basis for the new balance. Applicant credibly\ntestified that he verbally requested specific information about this account, including the\noriginal creditor and the nature of the charges.  The current creditor failed to provide this\n8\ninformation in its letter of September 6, 2007; rather, it requested payment in full. This\ncreditor has not filed an action in court to obtain a judgment and collect its debt. From\nthis failure, I infer that the creditor knows that the claim is barred by the statute of\nlimitations and lacks supporting documentation for its claim. At least one credit reporting\nagency shows this debt as paid. Likewise, the other creditors have not sought recovery\nof the alleged debts through legal process.9\nThe debt listed in allegation \u00b6 1.d is not sufficiently identified for Applicant to\ndetermine the original creditor, the actual amount of the debt, and the basis for the debt.\n\nGE 3, Creditor letter, dated May 6, 2008 and attachments; GE 4, GE 5, GE 6; AE B; Tr.  84-86.\n10\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 24; Tr. 56-62, 111-116.\n11\n5\nFinally, the debt identified in allegation \u00b6 1.f is listed in the April 5, 2006 as sold to\nanother creditor. This debt is not listed in any later credit reports. I infer that since the\ndebt was sold to another creditor, it was mistakenly listed in Applicant\u2019s credit report.\nApplicant denies knowledge of all the debts except the first debt. He admits having a\ncredit card with the bank listed in allegation \u00b6 1.c, but states he paid the account and\nclosed the account. Applicant acknowledged these debts could have been established\nin his first marriage, but he has no knowledge or recollection that the accounts were\nacquired in his first marriage. He credibly testified that he verbally requested information\nfrom the creditors about the nature of the debts owed to determine if the debts are his.10\nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application, he answered \u201cno\u201d\nto question f in Section 23: Your Police Record. He answered \u201cno\u201d based on the advise\ngiven to him by his criminal attorney in 2004.11\nThe record contains two possible social security numbers for Applicant. In the\nSF-86, he lists his social security number and his military service/ certificate number.\nThe third digit of his military number is different than the third digit of his social security\nnumber. Otherwise both numbers are the same and are listed on his credit reports. I\nfind that these numbers belong to Applicant.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n6\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nIn the instant case, Applicant has denied owing the debts listed in the SOR. The\ngovernment bears the burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant owes\nthe debts listed. The record contains six credit reports, which provide conflicting\ninformation about his past debts and credit history. All of the reports, except the most\nrecent, contain a lengthy credit history for Applicant. The 2007 and 2008 credit reports\nreflect an excellent credit history for the last 10 years or more. Given the existence of a\n10-year credit history in the reports prepared by Experian and Equifax, the absence of\n\n7\nsome of the debts listed in the SOR can not be explained as dropped from the report\ndue to age. The inconsistency in the information provided by Experian and Equifax in\nthe 2006 and 2007 credit reports is not explained. In light of his lack of knowledge about\nthese debts and the lack of substantive information in these credit reports about the\nsource and type of debts, the reports are not sufficient to establish that Applicant owes\nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d and 1.f. Thus, the government has not met it\nburden of proof as to these allegations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant acknowledged the debt in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a and the\nevidence indicates that the debt in SOR allegation 1.c belongs to Applicant. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s two\ndebts occurred in 2000, shortly after his divorce from his first wife. Applicant has not\nincurred any delinquent debt since this time. With his present income level and payment\nhistory, there is little likelihood that he will have debt problems in the future. This\nmitigating condition has some applicability. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose shortly after his divorce in 1999 and may be\nrelated to unknown accounts from his previous marriage. He has requested information\nto determine if these debts are his. He has acted reasonably in requesting information\nabout debts unknown to him. I find this potentially mitigating condition has some\napplicability in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling nor has he resolved\nthese two delinquent debts. Applicant has sought information to determine if these\ndebts are his, but the creditors have refused to provide him with information. The credit\nreports indicate Applicant\u2019s finances are under control. I conclude that these potentially\nmitigating conditions apply partially.\n\nThe debts not established as Applicant\u2019s are also barred by the state\u2019s statute of limitation.\n12\nA  State Court of Appeals, in another jurisdiction, succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of\n13\napplication of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they stimulate\nactivity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human\naffairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable\ngoal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations\nprovide potential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be\nha[led] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage\nplaintiffs from sitting on their rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our\njudicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted).\n8\nFinally, AG \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue\u201d has partial applicability. Applicant credibly testified to\ntelephone contacts to the creditors, as shown by the September 2007 letters from one\ncreditor. That creditor has refused to provide him with detailed information about the old\ndebt it wants him to pay. Except for the creditor listed in allegation \u00b6 1.a of the SOR, the\nremaining creditors have not responded to his verbal requests for information on the\ndebt.\nHe also receives some credit in the whole person analysis, infra, for the\napplication of the state\u2019s 6-year statute of limitations, which applies to the debts listed in\nSOR allegations 1.a and 1.c.  Under tate law, the creditors are time barred from\n12\ncollecting these debts See State Code. Ann. \u00a713-80-103.5.  Elimination of these\n13\ndelinquent debts through the statute of limitations has ended his potential vulnerability\nto improper financial inducements related to these debts as he no longer has any legal\nresponsibility for these debts. The fact that these debts are very old and not collectible\nunder state law may not negate his past conduct in not paying these outstanding debts,\na factor I must consider.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct::\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n14\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n9\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\nThe government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86\nwhen he answered \u201cno\u201d to Question f in Section 23 about his past criminal record. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to his honesty. For this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be\ndeliberate. He denies, however, that he deliberately falsified his answer to these\nquestions. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove\nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative\njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is\ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the\ntime the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish\n14\nthat Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nAt the time he completed his SF-86, Applicant knew he had been arrested for\ndomestic violence following an argument with his wife in 2003. Given his long\nexperience in security work, he knew this information was relevant to his background\ninvestigation. He deliberately falsified his answer to this question. The government has\nestablished its case.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.\nFollowing his arrest in 2003 and the dismissal of the charges by the prosecutor,\nApplicant asked his criminal attorney to petition the court to expunge his record. In May\n2004, the court sealed his arrest and criminal record. Because he knew his arrest may\nhave a negative impact on future jobs, Applicant asked his criminal attorney if he had to\nprovide any information about his arrest since his record had been expunged. His\ncounsel told him he did not have to discuss the arrest because the expungement meant\n\n10\nit never happened. Thus, Applicant understood that when his record had been\nexpunged, he had no past criminal record. Applicant thought expungement and sealed\nmeant the same thing. To his detriment, Applicant relied upon the incorrect advice of his\ncriminal attorney and did not list his 2003 arrest. He has mitigated the Guideline E\nsecurity concern.\nGuideline J\nIn light of my finding under Guideline E, the government has not established its\ncase under this guideline.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Until his divorce in 1999, Applicant\nhad excellent credit. Shortly thereafter in 2000 and unbeknownst to him, problems\ndeveloped with his credit because several debts had not been paid. Outside of this year,\nthe record shows that Applicant timely paid his debts and continues to do so. \nApplicant sought information from the creditors about the debts listed in the April\n2006 credit report so that he could understand what type of debts he owed, the source\nof the debts, and his actual liability for the debts. The creditors have refused to provide\nhim with this information, most likely because the listed creditors do not have the\ninformation requested. The same creditors have failed to use the legal process to obtain\na judgement, in part for the same reason. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay these old debts is\nnot because of neglect but because of lack of knowledge about the existence of the\ndebts. When he learned that he had these debts in 2006, he requested additional\n\n11\ninformation for the purpose of determining if the debts were his, a reasonable request\non his part. He cannot be faulted for the refusal of the creditors to provide him with the\ninformation requested.\nApplicant held a top secret-SCI clearance for many years without incident. There\nis little likelihood that he can be pressured or coerced because of these unpaid debts.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument that these debts may have occurred during his first\nmarriage is speculative, and thus, insufficient to establish that the debts are his. He\nreceived extensive training and has a good record of commendable duty performance\nduring and after his military service. He is married and has one daughter living with him.\nAs a result, he has focused his attention on providing a stable domestic environment for\nhis family. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid B it is\nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security\nclearance. While some debts remain unresolved, they are insufficient to raise security\nconcerns. His finances are stable and his monthly bills are paid in a timely manner.\n(See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCaroline H. Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 29 years old, unmarried, and works as an electrical engineer for a defense\ncontractor.  He and his family come from the Middle East, specifically Jordan.  Three brothers and\nApplicant came to the United States over the past 20 years to obtain an education, to live, and to\nwork.  Applicant mitigated the foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns.  Clearance\nis granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On March 16, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference)\nand Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on\nMarch 28, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was\nassigned to me on July 17, 2007.  On August 8, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nThe Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  I\nleft the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional exhibits.  Those exhibits were sent and\nreceived at DOHA within the allowed time period.  The Government had no objection to them, and\nI admitted them into evidence as Exhibits C through F (Tr. 66).  DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on August 27, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Exhibit 2.  Department\nCounsel also provided supporting documents to show the basis for the facts in Exhibit 2.  Applicant\nhad no objection to administrative notice of the facts in Exhibit 2.\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004);\nMcLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3  Cir. 1986).  The most\nrd\ncommon basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well\nknown or from government reports.  See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co.\n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  I took administrative notice of various\nfacts derived from Ex. 2 as indicated under the subheadings \u201cJordan,\u201d \u201cSaudi Arabia,\u201d and \u201cKuwait\u201d\nof this decision.\nThe Government moved to amend the SOR with two amendments.  Applicant did not object\nto either amendment, so I granted them both.  The first amendment was to add Subparagraph 2.e\nunder Guideline B, the language, \u201ce. You traveled to Jordan in 2000.\u201d (Tr. 7)  The second\namendment was to change the language in Subparagraph 2.c., to read, \u201cOne of your sisters is a\ncitizen of Jordan and a resident of Saudi Arabia.\u201d (Tr. 104, 105)\n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.\nApplicant denied the Paragraph C and B security concerns, and denied Subparagraph 2.c. of the\nSOR.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of\nthat evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 29 years old, unmarried, and the youngest of eight children.  He was born in\nKuwait.  He immigrated to the United States in 1998 to attend college.  He completed his bachelor\u2019s\nand master\u2019s degrees in engineering in the United States, graduating with his masters degree in 2006.\nHe became a U.S. citizen in 2004.  Applicant\u2019s parents sent him and his brothers to the U.S. to be\neducated.  They and his brothers paid for Applicant\u2019s college and advanced degree.  Applicant does\nnot own any property outside the United States, and rents an apartment in the city in which he works.\nNone of his family members know the type of work he does, because he tells them he works for a\npower supply company as an electrical engineer. (Tr. 25-28, 30, 45-48, 74, 75, 84; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant has seven older siblings:\n  \nThe oldest brother lives in Kuwait and has dual Jordanian/Canadian citizenship.  This brother\nalways worked for private engineering companies.  Applicant speaks with this brother only on\nholidays, and has not spoken with him in 2007.  They do have infrequent email communications with\neach other.  \nApplicant\u2019s second oldest brother lives in the United States, is a U.S. citizen, owns his home,\nand has a business.  He is a married and has four children.  His wife came from Jordan, but is also\na naturalized U.S. citizen.  \nThe third oldest brother is a Canadian resident and citizen, and also is a Jordanian dual\ncitizen.  Applicant talks to him about every three months.  His wife is a native-born Canadian. He\nhas two children, and has not returned to Jordan since he married in Canada.  \nApplicant\u2019s fourth brother lives in the United States, and is a naturalized citizen.  His\nchildren were born in the United States.  The fourth brother traveled to Jordan about four years ago.\nThe fifth brother also lives in the United States and is a naturalized citizen.  His wife is from Jordan\noriginally.  They have three children.  \nApplicant also has two sisters.  One sister is a citizen resident of Jordan.  She is married to\na man in the import and export business in Jordan.  They have three children.  Applicant saw her in\n2000 on his trip to Jordan, and he speaks with her once or twice a year.  She has never been to the\nUnited States.  He also visited with her once a week when he was working in Jordan in 2006 on\nassignment from his employer.  He has not had contact with her since his return from Jordan in\nMarch 2007.  \nThe youngest sister is a citizen of Jordan residing with her family in Saudi Arabia.  Her\nhusband is an electrical engineer.  Applicant speaks with this sister once or twice a year.  He last saw\nthis sister in the summer of 2006 in Jordan. (Tr. 31-33, 51-74, 105; Exhibit 1)\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s parents live in Jordan.  They have U.S. \u201cgreen cards,\u201d and have had the cards\nsince the 1970s.  They travel to the United States annually to spend four or five months with\nApplicant and his three brothers who live here.  When they are in the United States, Applicant visits\nwith them frequently.  He speaks with them once a week when they are in Jordan. (Tr. 26-28, 27, 50,\n75, 76, 79, 88; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant traveled to Jordan to visit his parents in 2000 for three months, taking his niece\nand nephew with him.  On that trip he used his Jordanian passport.  His next trip to Jordan was in\nAugust 2006, when his employer sent him to work in Jordan until March 2007, pursuant to a\ntechnical assistance contract with the Jordanian armed forces.  He obtained advance approval\nrecorded on a company form for that trip.  He also signed the necessary export compliance and\nrequest forms, as required by law.  On that trip he used only his U.S. passport.  Applicant is\nrecognized by Jordanian officers and other personnel who work with Applicant\u2019s employer on the\ncontract when they saw him in the plant in the United States and on site in Jordan as someone who\noriginally came from Jordan and speaks Arabic, so they feel comfortable with him.  Applicant has\nno present plans to travel to Jordan for business or family visits.  On his trip in 2006, he visited with\nhis parents three or four times a week. (Tr. 21, 66-68, 72, 77, 78, 90-93; Exhibits 1, A-F)\nApplicant has a Jordanian passport.  He renewed it on June 9, 2003, at the request of the U.S.\nimmigration authorities so he would have a current passport before Applicant took his citizenship\nexam and became a U.S. citizen.  It expires on June 9, 2008.  Applicant does not use the Jordanian\npassport now that he has a U.S. passport.  After retrieving the Jordanian passport from one of his\nbrother\u2019s house, he surrendered the Jordanian passport to his employer\u2019s security officer, who put\nit in Applicant\u2019s security file.  If Applicant were to reclaim that passport, the employer would make\nan entry on the JPAS system of that action.  Since becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant only uses the\nU.S. passport for travel. (Tr. 23, 77, 78, 82-86, 89; Exhibit B)\nApplicant has Jordanian citizenship along with his Jordanian passport.  Applicant expressed\na willingness to renounce his Jordanian citizenship.  He has read in the Jordanian newspapers the\nlists of persons who have renounced their Jordanian citizenship.  Applicant is of the belief that such\na renunciation would make him an enemy of Jordan in the eyes of Jordanian officials, including\nthose to come to his employer\u2019s plant.  Applicant is concerned that because his company has a\ncontract to do work for Jordan, if he renounces his citizenship he will be put in a difficult position.\nIf there is no need to renounce it now, he would prefer not to do so, so he can continue to work on\nthat contract for his company.  Applicant also told the Government investigator that he was willing\nto renounce his Jordanian citizenship. (Tr. 23, 85-94)\nJordan is a small, Middle Eastern country governed by a constitutional monarchy.   It has a\npro-Western foreign policy, and has had close relations with the United States for more than forty\nyears.  Torture, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, overcrowded prisons, denial of due process, and\nrestrictions on freedom of speech are Jordanian human rights problems.  Despite governmental\nefforts against terrorism, the threat posed by terrorists remains high in Jordan.  Terrorists target U.S.\ninterests to undermine U.S. national security interests.  Terrorist groups conduct intelligence\nactivities as effectively as state intelligence services. (Exhibit 2)\nSaudi Arabia is a monarchy with a consultative council appointed by the monarch.  That\ncouncil came into existence in 1992.  The United States and Saudi Arabia share a common concern\n\n5\nabout regional security, oil exports and imports, sustainable development, and counter-terrorism\nefforts.  There are some concerns about human rights in Saudi Arabia, including abuse of prisoners,\nincommunicado detentions, restrictions on freedom of speech, press, peaceful assembly and\nassociation, religion, discrimination against women and minorities, and suppression of worker\u2019s\nrights.  Islamic Law governs the country. (Exhibit 2)\nKuwait is a constitutional hereditary emirate.  It has an elected legislature.  Kuwait has some\nhuman rights issues, including maltreatment of prisoners, unlawful deprivation of life, incomplete\njudicial independence, restricted freedoms of press, speech, assembly, association and religion,\ncorruption, and human trafficking.  Kuwaiti citizens constitute only 34% of the population of 2.9\nmillion people.  The citizens have a generous social welfare system financed by oil revenues.\nKuwait condemned terrorism in various public forums, changed its laws on money laundering, and\nmade other changes to combat terrorism.  However, the risk of a terrorist attack in Kuwait remains\nhigh because the Kuwaiti government is reluctant to confront domestic extremists, and supporters\nof terrorism active in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Kuwait lacks strong legal provisions to combat\nconspiracies to commit terrorism.  In 2006, Kuwait opened its World Moderation Center to combat\nterrorism and promote moderation among Muslims through education, training, international\ndialogue, and research. (Exhibit 2)\nApplicant\u2019s co-workers, friends, and former supervisors submitted letters on his behalf.\nApplicant is regarded by them as hard-working, dependable, smart, conscientious, cooperative, and\na team player.  They also regard him as a man of integrity and honesty. (Tr. 24; Exhibit B)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n\n6\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline C:  The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. \u00b69\nGuideline B:  The Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\n\n7\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism. \u00b66\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Preference:  Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2004.  He holds a current Jordanian\npassport.  It remains current until June, 2008.  He has dual citizenship with Jordan. \nThe Government established a prima facie case under this guideline.  The Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) that could raise a security concern and be disqualifying are the exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen, to include but not be\nlimited to possession of a current foreign passport. \u00b610.a.1.\nApplicant was born in Kuwait and his parents live in Jordan.  Applicant expressed a\nwillingness to renounce his dual citizenship, both at the hearing and to the Government investigator.\nBefore he became a U.S. citizen, Applicant obtained a renewal of his Jordanian passport in 2003,\nwhen that passport was about to expire.  He contends the U.S. immigration personnel told him to\nrenew the Jordanian passport so he would have a valid passport before the final decision and action\non his application for U.S. citizenship.  He has used only the U.S. passport since becoming a U.S.\ncitizen.  He surrendered the Jordanian passport to his employer\u2019s security officer for holding.\nApplicant did not have possession of that passport before he surrendered it, because he had one of\nhis brothers keep it for him.\nFour of the Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply.  Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship is based solely\non his parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country.  Applicant is the youngest of eight children\nand was born where his parents resided in 1979, which was Kuwait (\u00b611.a).  Applicant repeatedly\nexpressed a willingness to renounce his Jordanian citizenship (\u00b611.b).  The Jordanian passport was\nobtained and renewed before Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2004 (\u00b611.c).  His Jordanian\npassport he surrendered to his company\u2019s security officer, who placed it in Applicant\u2019s security file.\nIf Applicant seeks to have it returned to him before, or even after it expires in 2008, the security\nofficer declared it would be noted on the Government JPAS computer system in an incident report.\n(\u00b611.e)\nForeign Influence:  Applicant has family members, siblings and parents, living in Kuwait,\nSaudi Arabia, and Jordan.  He also has three brothers in the United States, and a fourth brother in\nCanada.  If Applicant has contact with relatives in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient\nto create potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified\ninformation.  Applicant has frequent contact with his parents.  He has less contact with his siblings\nin Jordan, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.  He communicates frequently with his three brothers in the\nUnited States.  His close relationship with his parents creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure\nor attempted exploitation because terrorists in the Middle East seek intelligence and are hostile to\nthe United States.  A security concern arises because Applicant may desire to help his parents or\nsiblings in a particular situation.  \n\n8\nThe Government presented substantial evidence of two disqualifying conditions.  The\ncondition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying which is applicable here is\n\u00b67.a (contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion), and \u00b67.b (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation).  The burden now shifts to the Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.  The Government never has to prove the applicability of a mitigating condition.\nTwo mitigating conditions are potentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions:\n\u00b68.a the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of the foreign individual and the interests of\nthe U.S.; and, \n\u00b68.b there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can\nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests. \nApplicant has a sufficient relationship with his parents, and a lesser relationship with his\nthree siblings in the Middle East, which make \u00b68.a inapplicable.  There is a remote possibility that\nterrorists could attempt to coerce or threaten Applicant through his parents or three siblings.  He\nmight be placed in the situation of having to choose between his family members and the interests\nof the United States.\nApplicant showed \u00b68.b applied.  He established a sufficient relationship and depth of loyalty\nto the United States that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United\nStates.  He came to the United States in 1998 for his education.  Three of his brothers followed the\nsame path prior to Applicant, pushed by their parents who realized their children would  have a better\nlife in the United States than elsewhere.  He became a U.S. citizen in 2004.  Since arriving in the\nUnited States, Applicant made only one voluntary trip back to Jordan.  His 2006 trip was at the\ndirection of his employer.  In preparation of that trip, Applicant complied with all filing and\ndisclosure requirements.  Applicant likes his job, and is closer to his siblings in the United States\nthan to those in the Middle East.  His parents have green cards, and spend nearly half of each year\nin the United States visiting Applicant and his siblings.  Applicant has no property or assets outside\nthe United States.  He uses only his U.S. passport when traveling outside the United States.\nWhole Person Analysis  \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security\nclearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent\ncriteria and adjudication policy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG\n\n9\n\u00b6 2(a). In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nAG \u00b6 2(a).\nOf the nine adjudicative process factors which are used in the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, only\nthe eighth one, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d is the most relevant.\nIn addition to that factor, other \u201cavailable, reliable information about the person, past and present\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d (Adjudicative\nProcess, \u00b62.a)\nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security clearance.\nApplicant is a mature person with two college degrees in a technical profession.  He has lived in the\nUnited States for nine years, and is part of his family\u2019s tradition and practice of coming to America\nto study, be educated, marry, get a good job, and become a U.S. citizen.  His three brothers in the\nUnited States fulfilled those goals, and Applicant has done the same.  He received very favorable\ncomments from his co-workers and superiors about his work product and work ethic.  There is no\nstatement he submitted that opposes his security clearance application or produced any derogatory\ninformation about him.  His ties to the  United States are stronger than his ties to any Middle Eastern\ncountry, more particularly shown by his making only one voluntary trip with a niece and nephew to\nJordan in nine years.  His brothers do not travel back there on a regular basis, either.  These four\nbrothers are focused on the United States and their future here.  Applicant is part of that process and\neffort.  His parents spend nearly half of each year in the United States.  His Jordanian passport is held\nby his employer\u2019s security officer and expires in less than one year.  He expressed a willingness to\nrenounce his Jordanian citizenship.\nSome circumstances weigh against Applicant in the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Jordan has a\nsignificant risk of terrorist activity, as does Saudi Arabia where one of Applicant\u2019s sisters lives.  He\nhas a brother in Kuwait.  Terrorists may attempt to use his family members to obtain classified\ninformation.  But Applicant has not disclosed the nature of his work to his family, and the Jordanian\ngovernment has an interest in protecting Applicant because he is helping it pursuant to the contract\nbetween his employer and that government.  Applicant was born in Kuwait, and spent his formative\nyears in the Middle East.  Lastly, he has frequent contact with his parents, who also helped pay for\nhis education in the United States.  The closer the connection to a relative in a foreign country, the\ngreater the risk that pressure might result in a compromise of national security.\nAfter weighing all these factors, the facts, and the DC and MC under these guidelines, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign preference and foreign\ninfluence.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis for Applicant.  The evidence leaves me with\nno doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a to 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June 6, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested that the case be decided on the written record.  On\nDecember 5, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Joseph Testan denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate.\nApplicant contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application by\nfailing to disclose an arrest on charges of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and Driving While\nHaving a Measurable Blood Alcohol of .08% or More by Weight.  In support of this contention, he\nargues that he thought he was only required to disclose convictions.  Applicant has not demonstrated\nthat the Judge erred.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17691 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.19,\n2003).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant elected to have his case decided on the written administrative record and then did\nnot respond to the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM).  As a result, the Judge did not\nhave an opportunity to question him about the omission and evaluate his credibility in the context\nof a hearing.   A review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge considered Applicant\u2019s\n1\nexplanation for why he failed to disclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as\na matter of law, to accept or reject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation in light of the record evidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to\nfind that Applicant\u2019s omission was deliberate and intentional.  Given the limited record that was\nbefore him, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is sustainable, and his ultimate unfavorable\nclearance decision under Guidelines E and J not arbitrary, capricious nor contrary to law.  See\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006). \n\n3\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

In April 2006, he pleaded guilty to the second charge and was fined $2,050.00, placed on probation for five years, and ordered to complete a first conviction program.

Clearance is\ndenied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 29, 2007, and elected to have his case\ndetermined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's\nwritten case (FORM) on or about August 8, 2007. Applicant did not file a response to the FORM.\nThe case was assigned to me on November 9, 2007.\nRULING ON PROCEDURE\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s Motion to amend the SOR, by changing the date on which applicant\nallegedly executed a falsified SCA, is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 51 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nOn January 8, 2006, applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol and/or Drugs and (2) Driving While Having a Measurable Blood Alcohol of .08% or\nMore by Weight. In April 2006, he pleaded guilty to the second charge and was fined $2,050.00,\nplaced on probation for five years, and ordered to complete a first conviction program.\nApplicant falsified material facts on an SCA he executed on January 27, 2006 by failing to\ndisclose the aforementioned charges in response to Question 23(D). Although applicant responded\nin the affirmative to Question 23(D), which appeared on the SCA as \u201c23D - ALCOHOL/DRUG\nCHARGE?\u201d in explanation, he disclosed only a 1990 DUI conviction.\nIn his response to the SOR, applicant stated he \u201cthought the question was for a conviction.\u201d\nHe further stated he did not intend to mislead or falsify the SCA.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWith respect to Guideline J, the evidence establishes that in 2006, applicant was charged\nwith, and convicted of, driving with an alcohol level higher than the legal limit. As a result of the\nconviction, he was fined, placed on probation for five years, and ordered to complete a first\nconviction program. The SCA indicates he has at least one prior DUI. These facts require application\n\n There is no evidence that applicant paid the fine or completed the first conviction\n1\nprogram.\n3\nof Disqualifying Conditions 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and 31 (d)\n(individual is currently on probation).\nAlthough two alcohol-related driving incidents over 15 years apart establishes a prima facie\ncase under Guideline J, it is not a very strong case. Applicant may very well have been able to\novercome the Government\u2019s prima facie case had he offered credible evidence in mitigation.\nHowever, applicant offered no evidence in mitigation, and without such evidence, there is no basis\nupon which to conclude he has overcome the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline J.1\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that applicant failed to disclose his\n2006 alcohol-related charges when he completed the SCA just a few weeks after his arrest. Applicant\nclaims  he misunderstood the question, even though the word \u201ccharge\u201d is prominently displayed and\nthe word \u201cconviction\u201d is nowhere to be found. Applicant is a mature, experienced, and intelligent\nindividual, as evidenced by the fact he teaches at a community college. He is simply too intelligent\nto have misunderstood the question.\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to\nour nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts on an SCA, it is\nextremely difficult to conclude that he or she nevertheless possesses the good judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness required of clearance holders. Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification requires\napplication of Disqualifying Condition 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire  . . .).  No Mitigating Conditions apply.\nBased on the foregoing, Guideline E is found against applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nPARAGRAPH 2: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\n____________________________\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 19, 2007, admitted all of the\nallegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 23,\n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 21, 2008 scheduling it for March\n12, 2008. During the hearing, I received 10 government exhibits, four Applicant exhibits,\nand the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. At department counsel\u2019s request, I took\nadministrative notice of the state code governing driving under the influence of alcohol\nand refusal to take breathalyzers. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March\nApril 22, 2008\n\n2\n19, 2008. Based on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old single man with three children, ages 20, 16, and 13.\nHe has a high school education. He works for a contractor on a military base as a sheet\nmetal welder. According to his supervisor, he is an outstanding employee with proven\nleadership abilities (Exhibit A). \nApplicant lived with the mother of children through early 1996. They had a\nvolatile relationship. In March 1996, he spotted her driving sitting in her car with a male\npassenger. They were separated at the time, with a protective order in place. Enraged,\nhe ran toward the car, as the passenger fled from the car. Applicant then dragged her\nfrom the car and began brutally beating her. He did not cease the attack until several\nbystanders intervened (Exhibit 2). Applicant then went to her home to remove some\njointly-owned furniture. Unable to procure a moving truck, he destroyed it with a knife\n(Tr. 70, Exhibit 9 at 10). \nSubsequently, Applicant was charged with assault, violation of a protective order,\nbattery, and assault with a deadly weapon (Tr. 73). While the trial was pending, he was\ncharged three times with contempt for failure to appear at various pre-trial hearings\n(Exhibit 4 at 2). The record does not indicate whether the contempt charges were civil or\ncriminal. In July 1996, he was sentenced to three years probation, and ordered to pay\nrestitution (Exhibit 2).\nIn April 2000, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana and violation\nof probation. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined. At the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that the marijuana belonged to his brother, and that he took the charge for him\n(Tr. 70). Earlier, during an interview with a security clearance investigator, Applicant\nstated the marijuana was his (Tr. 79). When asked by department counsel to explain\nwhy he told the investigator the marijuana was his, if it actually belonged to his brother,\nApplicant responded, \u201c[b]ecause he didn\u2019t ask if it was my brother\u2019s\u201d (Tr. 79).\nIn February 2001, Applicant was charged with theft, less than $500 after his ex\ngirlfriend accused him of stealing her mail (Tr. 32). The charge was not prosecuted.\nIn March 2001, Applicant and his ex-girlfriend got into a heated argument in a\nbasketball gym where their daughter was playing. When the ex-girlfriend began striking\nApplicant, he \u201cphysically restrained\u201d her (Tr. 33). Applicant was then charged with\nassault. The charge was nolle prossed.\nIn September 2005, Applicant was charged with, among other things, attempting\nto drive a vehicle while impaired by alcohol. In November 2005, Applicant was again\ncharged with attempting to drive a vehicle while impaired by alcohol. The cases were\n\n3\nconsolidated. Currently, the trial is pending. Applicant failed to list the second alcohol-\nrelated charge, as required, on a 2006 security clearance application. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant has a history of criminal activity including a domestic violence-related assault\ncharge, a drug charge, and two alcohol-related charges. The government did not\nestablish that the contempt charges were criminal, therefore, I find in Applicant\u2019s favor\nwith respect to SOR subparagraphs 1.c through 1.e.\nThe assault and the drug charges led to convictions, and the alcohol-related\ncharges are still pending. AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses,\u201d applies.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant\u2019s\ngood employment record constitutes evidence of rehabilitation. It is greatly outweighed\nby the extent, seriousness, and recency of his criminal conduct. Also, Applicant\n\n4\nrepeatedly demonstrated a lack of credibility throughout the investigative process by\nproviding contradictory explanations for the 2000 marijuana charge, and minimizing the\nseverity of the 1996 assault on his then-girlfriend. I conclude his criminal conduct\nremains a security concern.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant\u2019s security clearance application omissions raise the\nissue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies.\nBecause Applicant was not credible (see Criminal Conduct section, supra), I do\nnot believe his explanation for the security clearance application omissions. I conclude\nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies without mitigation.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nI considered the whole person factors in my analyses of the criminal and\npersonal conduct sections of the decision, and my analysis does not support a favorable\noutcome. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f - 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

WESLEY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant has a number of listed delinquent debts, two of which she disputes and the balance\nof which she acknowledges as her own.   By her demonstrated good-faith disputes with the two\ncreditors, her initiated counseling, and the steps she has taken to discharge her other creditors, she\ndemonstrates  extenuating circumstances and ensuing corrective efforts to discharge her accepted\ndebts and ensure control over her finances in the future.  Applicant mitigates security concerns\nassociated with her delinquent debts.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 10, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on June 22, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on July 25, 2007.  A hearing was\nheld on July 25, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of three  exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and five\nexhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on August 3, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to keep the record open to permit\nher the opportunity to assess any net monthly remainder from her husband\u2019s earnings.  For good\ncause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record.  The Government, in turn\nwas allowed three days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant furnished a summary of\nmonthly expenses for April-July 2007 and approximate monthly income by both Applicant and her\nhusband for the same period.  Additionally, Applicant timely supplemented the record with a letter\nof additional information regarding her brother-in-law\u2019s lack of funds to pay for the truck he is\npurchasing from Applicant and her husband, and other expense outlays not covered at the hearing.\nShe also confirmed Applicant\u2019s enrollment in counseling, and a documented payment arrangement\non her Ford debt.  There being no objection from the Government, and good cause demonstrated,\nApplicant\u2019s supplemental exhibits are admitted as Applicant\u2019s exhibits F through I. \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated seven delinquent debts\nexceeding $10,000.00.  For her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all but two of the listed\ndebts, denying the debts listed under sub-paragraphs 1.b and 1.h.\n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 26-year-old engineer technician for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated herein\nby reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts (seven altogether) between 1999 and\n2004.  One of the debts (creditor 1.a) represents back rent owed to a landlord for an apartment\nApplicant shared with a friend.  Applicant was under the impression at the time that the friend would\ntake care of the rent.  She later learned that the friend did not pay the rent.  Applicant has since\ncommunicated with the landlord and arranged to make monthly payments to creditor 1.a (see ex. B;\nR.T., at 22).  A second listed debt with the landlord (creditor 1.b) appears to be a duplicate, and\nApplicant has asked credit reporting agencies to delete the debt from her credit reports (see ex. D;\nR.T., at 24-26).  Her payment arrangement with the landlord creditor (identified as creditor 1.a)\ncorroborates her duplicate explanation and is accepted.\nApplicant assumed responsibility for a vehicle in July 1999 (see ex.3).  Her brother-in-law\nhas since purchased the truck from her but has lacked the funds to pay it off since his recent collision\nwith the truck (which resulted in out-of-pocket repairs and assumption of the deductible).  So, for\nthe past two months Applicant has been covering for the brother-in-law in making the remaining\nmonthly payments ($239.88 a month).  Applicant expects she and her husband (H) will have to\ncontinue their monthly payments on the truck for the ensuing one to two months until her brother-in-\nlaw gets caught up with his expenses (see ex. F; R.T., at 34). When her brother-in-law is able to\nresume his monthly truck payments, Applicant and H expect to be able to apply the expected\nmonthly savings to their creditor 1.c wireless debt and pay off the $409.00 balance (R.T., at 32-34).\nApplicant\u2019s listed debt with creditor 1.d is a disputed credit card debt.  Applicant took out\na line of credit with this company in September 2000 while in college and acknowledges purchases\ntotaling around $350.00 (see ex. 3; R.T., at 51).  With limited funds, she has not been able to pay the\ndebt off and in recent years has been burdened with interest and late fees on the account.  She has\nbeen endeavoring to obtain an updated account history and acknowledges owing no more than\n$600.00, inclusive of interest and late fees (R.T., at 38-39).  \nApplicant became indebted to other creditors as well: creditors 1.e (a wireless utility account)\nand 1.g (a deficiency owed on a repossessed Ford Ranger truck).  When she signed for a wireless\naccount with creditor 1.e in February 2004, Applicant assumed her wireless plan provided\nnationwide service (R.T., at 40-41).  She subsequently learned that her service only had regional\nreach.  She has since entered into a payment agreement with creditor 1.e that provides for monthly\npayments of $121.56 and assures she will be able to make the required payments on the account until\nit is payed off (see ex. C; R.T., at 22-23; 40-41).  \nApplicant\u2019s debt with FMCC (creditor 1.g)  represents a deficiency balance on a Ford Ranger\nshe purchased in October 2000 (for around $20,000.00) and paid down the balance to approximately\n$11,000.00 before she became pregnant without health insurance and could no longer manage her\ncar payment.  So, she permitted the truck to be repossessed in March 2004 (see ex. 3; R.T., at 52-53).\nThe deficiency following the vehicle\u2019s sale was $5,636.00 (see ex.3).   Applicant documents entering\n\n4\ninto a repayment agreement with the creditor assignee for the ensuing six months that calls for\n$150.00 a month payments on the current assessed balance of $7,541.92 (see ex. I).  The payment\nagreement does not explain what is expected of the parties after the expiration of the initial six\nmonths.\nApplicant\u2019s last listed creditor is creditor 1.h: a collection account arising out of an imposed\ncourt fine for not appearing in court at the scheduled time to respond to a citation for driving on a\nsuspended license (R.T., at 54-57).  The carried balance on the court\u2019s records that was assigned to\ncreditor 1.h for  collection was $711.00.  Applicant documents paying this debt off in full in April\n2006 (see ex. A).\nApplicant has since signed up for financial counseling to help to prevent any recurrent\nepisodes of debt delinquencies.  She documents enrolling in a 13-week financial management course\nthrough a local chapel program on her employer\u2019s work-site.  She is scheduled to commence classes\nin August 2003 (see ex. H).\nApplicant reported net monthly income of $2,200.00 for herself and $2,400.00 for H.  Her\ndetailed monthly expenses totaled around $3,100.00 (including child care and payments on her\ncreditor 1.a and creditor 1.e debts).  Applicant couldn\u2019t be sure what H was doing with his net\nmonthly income and wanted time to check with him (R.T., at 66-67).  Her revised net monthly\nincome and expenses leaves her with less of a remainder than she had estimated at hearing (see ex.\nG). Her estimated net total monthly expenses for H and herself was $4,4457.82 (reduced to\n$4,117.94 with her brother-in-law contributing as suggested at hearing).  Revised net monthly\nincome between Applicant and H is $4,700.00, a slight net reduction from what she estimated at\nhearing (compare ex. G with R.T., at 57-58). Under either estimate, though, Applicant and H appear\nto have some net proceeds after expenses to address her other debts.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\n\n5\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may\nlead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively\ndemonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it\ncan deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks\nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing\nhis or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is an engineer technician for a defense contractor who accumulated a number of\ndelinquent debts over a five-year period spanning 1999 and 2004: some disputed and some\nacknowledged.   Considered together, and without resolution, they raise  security significant\nconcerns.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines where the individual appellant is so financially overextended as to indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which can\nraise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation, and place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and her past failures to document payments on any\nof her listed debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines for financial considerations: DC 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and\nDC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to her continuing disputes over the justification of\ntwo of her listed debts, i.e., creditor 1.b (an apparent duplicate debt with her prior landlord) and\ncreditor 1.d (a long disputed credit card account), the lack of health insurance to cover experienced\nmedical complications associated with her pregnancy, and extended assistance to a brother-in-law\nto cover car payments on a vehicle the latter had purchased from Applicant.  \nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has initiated considerable efforts to resolve the debts\nshe acknowledges as her own.  Specifically, she is able to document paying off one of her listed\ncreditors (creditor 1.h) and setting up payment arrangements to discharge three of the remaining\nones (creditors 1.a, 1.e, and 1.f).  She hopes to soon eliminate her interim support to her brother-in-\nlaw and apply the monthly savings to their still outstanding wireless debt.  Given her exhibited\nextenuating circumstances associated with her 2004 pregnancy, her limited resources available to\nher for an extended period between 2003 and 2006,  and her documented  responsible efforts to\nresolve her acknowledged debts, Applicant may rely on MC 20 (b) (the conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances) of the Guidelines for financial considerations. \nMitigation credit is also available to Applicant based on her presented repayment proofs.\nApplicant is able to demonstrate credible disputes with two of her listed creditors, (i.e., creditors\n1.b and 1.d) and initiated repayment efforts with remaining ones.  Age of the debts at issue is\ncovered by two of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations: MC 20(a) (the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\nhas applicability, while not dispositive.   MC 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute\nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue)\nhas applicability as well relative to her creditors 1.b (an apparent duplication) and 1.d (an\nacknowledged creditor who Applicant claims to have inflated the amount owed).\nWhile she is to be credited with her election to seek financial counseling, it is still too soon\nto determine whether or not she completes the identified course and profits from it.  So, at this time,\nshe may not claim credit from MC 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control).\nBased on her initiated efforts to date, though, prospects for her gaining important insights in\nhandling her finances in the future appear to be promising.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities,\namong which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial stability in a person\ncleared to access classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the\nholder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial\ndifficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\n\n7\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt\naccumulations and documented steps taken to resolve them, Applicant mitigates security concerns\nrelated to both her disputed debts and her proven debt delinquencies.  Favorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.h of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the\nE2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h:\nFOR APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Clearance denied.\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, as amended and\n1\nmodified\u2014most recently in August 2006 (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 23 April 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of\npersonal conduct and financial considerations.  Applicant answered the SOR 14 May 2007, and\n1\nrequested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 12 June 2007, and I convened a hearing 28 June\n2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 10 July 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations of deliberately falsifying two security clearance\napplications in \u00b61, but denied the allegations of financial delinquencies in \u00b62, except for  \u00b62.e.\nAccordingly, I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact.\nApplicant\u2014a 45-year-old security guard employed by a defense contractor since September\n2005\u2014seeks to retain the access to classified information he has had, as needed, since approximately\n1982.\nWhen Applicant completed clearance applications in December 1993 (G.E. 1), July 1999\n(G.E. 2), and April 2001 (G.E. 3), he truthfully disclosed an April 1992 arrest for felony assault with\na deadly weapon\u2014charges which were ultimately dropped. He failed to list this arrest on his\nSeptember 2005 clearance application, which he attributes to an oversight.\nWhen Applicant completed clearance applications in July 1999 and April 2001, he failed to\ndisclose two automobile repossessions within the last seven years\u2014in November 1995 and January\n1996. In his September 2005 clearance application, he failed to disclose delinquent accounts. He has\noffered no credible explanation why he failed to disclose his financial difficulties, as he was aware\non all three occasions that he had negative financial information required to be disclosed on the\napplications. In particular, he had been interviewed in May and June 2000 about the repossessions\nas part of the background investigation begun in July 1999. That investigation terminated in June\n2000, when Applicant no longer needed a clearance in his job (G.E. 5).\nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties dating to at least November 1995, when his\nfirst automobile was repossessed. Applicant purchased the automobile in June 1994, failed to make\nthe first payment on time, and ultimately was unable to keep up with the payments. The automobile\nwas repossessed in November 1995 and sold in March 1996,  resulting in a deficiency balance of\nnearly $6,600, which remains unpaid. After the November repossession, Applicant bought a second\nautomobile in January 1996, which he considered to be a lemon, although he never pursued lemon\nlaw or other consumer protection complaints against the seller. He surrendered the automobile\nvoluntarily in August 1996, and the seller reported a deficiency of over $9,000. When Applicant was\ninterviewed about these accounts in May and June 2000, he stated that he had not made payment on\n\n3\neither of the debts (G.E. 5). He reported nearly $800 per month negative cash flow based on his\nregular salary, but did not feel that he was over-extended because he frequently worked overtime.\nApplicant married in February 2002. He and his wife had difficulty managing their finances\nand eventually fell delinquent on several accounts, including the mortgage on a house they bought\nin August 2003. Applicant acknowledged (Tr. 40-41) that they sometimes spent money on frivolous\nthings and did not utilize a budget. \nWhen Applicant was interviewed about his clearance in April 2006 (G.E. 5), he\nacknowledged three delinquent accounts (SOR 2.b., 2.c., and 2.d..), as well as several medical\ncollection accounts (SOR 2.a.). He explained that he and his wife bought a home in August 2003 for\n$178,000 and refinanced it in 2004 for $192,000, but he had experienced a brief period of\nunemployment in February 2005, resulting in the delinquent accounts. He acknowledged receiving\ndunning letters and telephone calls from his creditors, but did not have the funds to repay them.\nAlthough he intended to repay his creditors when he was able, he had no specific plan for addressing\nhis debts, even though he knew that his job might be in jeopardy. Indeed, he took no steps to repay\nhis creditors until after he received DOHA interrogatories in February 2007 (G.E. 7). Those\ninterrogatories showed Applicant having $125 per month negative cash flow. In the wake of those\ninterrogatories, Applicant again refinanced his home, using cash out to pay all of the debts alleged\nin the SOR (.A.E. A), except 2.e., which remains unpaid because the creditor had archived his\nrecords and not yet been able to retrieve them (Tr. 38). He was not able to refinance his home any\nearlier because of his low credit score (Tr. 37). Although the mortgage company offered him credit\ncounseling along with the refinancing, Applicant declined because he believes his wife was\nresponsible for most of his financial difficulties (Tr. 74-75).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor considers him an honest employee and recommends him for his\nclearance (Tr. 92-95). He does not appear to be aware of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties or his\nfalsification of his clearance applications.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n3\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n4\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the\ndebt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . . (e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial\nanalysis;\n4\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns, except for \u00b61.a.. Having previously disclosed his April 1992 arrest\non several earlier clearance applications, it is unlikely he deliberately omitted this arrest from his\nSeptember 2005 clearance application. Further, the circumstances and disposition of that arrest were\nno longer relevant or material to a clearance determination in 2005. However, Applicant knew he\nhad adverse financial information that should have been reported on clearance applications in July\n1999, April 2001, and September 2005. He has offered no credible explanation for his failure to\ndisclose that information. I conclude he deliberately concealed the nature and extent of his financial\nproblems on his clearance applications.  In addition,  none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions\n3\napply. The concealed information was relevant to a clearance decision. I conclude Guideline E\nagainst Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. Government records reflect nearly $13,000 of delinquent debt\nacquired between November 1995 and April 2005.  Applicant attributes most of his financial\n4\nproblems to his wife, yet many of the debts were accrued before he married. Further, he experienced\nfinancial difficulties while he was in the military. While his unemployment in 2005 may have\naffected his finances some, it is clear the majority of his financial problems are attributable to his\ninability to live within his means, his unwillingness to seek and utilize financial counseling, and his\nfailure to establish any financial cushion for unforeseen expenses.\n\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n5\nunlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n6\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n7\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\n5\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His financial\ndifficulties are both recent and multiple;  indeed they may be ongoing. Applicant has not established\n5\nthat his debts were due to circumstances beyond his control, or that he has acted responsibly in\naddressing his debts.  There is no evidence that he has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought\n6\nthe problem under control.  Although he refinanced his home and paid the majority of his\n7\noutstanding debts just before the SOR was issued, the timing of the payments does not constitute a\ngood-faith effort to satisfy his debts.  Further, given his unwillingness to seek or use financial\n8\ncounseling, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will put his financial problem\nbehind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

He renounced Iranian citizenship and, with his Italian-born wife\nand daughters, are long-time U.S. citizens. His highly successful engineering career with a major\ncorporation led to his selection by top management, with high-level government concurrence, to an\nimportant and demanding position requiring a clearance. His ties and relations  in the U.S. weighed\nagainst minimal family contact in Iran, his character and history of protecting sensitive and classified\ninformation under identical circumstances, and the absence of any Iranian government contact with\nhis family to date mitigated foreign influence security concerns. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on October 26, 2005, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor. On February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR detailed reasons, under\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG),  why DOHA could\n1\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter dated April 10, 2007,  and\nelected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was then assigned to me on May\n9, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on June 4, 2007, and the hearing was held as scheduled on\nJuly 13, 2007. The Government offered two exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE)\n1 and 2, and admitted without objection.  The Government also submitted a request for\nadministrative notice of certain facts concerning Iran. Applicant\u2019s counsel made a relevance\nobjection to some of the contents of the supporting documents and to two of the facts of which the\nGovernment requested notice. After an explanation that irrelevant material would not be considered,\nwhich was accepted by counsel, administrative notice was taken of the truth of the proffered facts,\nsubject to a determination whether they were relevant and material to deciding contested issues. The\nmotion is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, with supporting government documents I through IX\nattached.  Concerning the source documentation, the government relied on publications of the\n2\n\nSee Background Note: Iran, dated Oct. 2006 (I); Consular Information Sheet: Iran, dated Apr. 3, 2006 (II);\n3\nTravel Warning: Iran, dated Oct. 10, 2006 (III); Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006: Iran, dated Mar.\n6, 2007 (V); and Country Reports on Terrorism 2005, dated Apr. 2006 (VI).\nSee Iran: U.S. Concerns and Policy Responses, dated Apr. 2, 2007 (IV).\n4\nSee The National Security Strategy of the United States of America, dated Mar. 16, 2006 (IX).\n5\nSee Statement for the Record Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, dated Jan. 11, 2007 (VII); and The\n6\nCurrent Situation in Iraq and Afghanistan Statement for the Record before the Senate Armed Services Committee, dated\nNov. 15, 2006 (VIII). \nThese findings are intentionally phrased in general terms to avoid identification of the individuals involved.\n7\nOmission of some specific facts raised by the evidence does not mean that the facts or supporting evidence were not\nconsidered. To the contrary, all were carefully evaluated. These facts are not in dispute, and are supported by GE 1 and\n2, AE A through T, Applicant\u2019s written response to the SOR (and Exhibits A through Q attached thereto), dated Apr.\n10, 2007, and the testimony of the three witnesses during the hearing (Tr. at 27-103).\n3\nDepartment of State,  the Congressional Research Service,  and the President,  and two Statements\n3\n4\n5\nfor the Record by the CIA Director before Senate Committees.  Applicant testified, and offered 20\n6\nexhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through T, and admitted without objection.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the truth of some factual allegations (while denying or asserting\nmitigation of the related security concerns) set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c (in part) pertaining\nto foreign influence under AG B. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He\ndenied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e.

He, his wife, and their elder daughter  became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1989. None\nof them have ever returned to Iran, and they affirmatively intend never to do so. Since 1980,\nApplicant has worked in increasingly responsible engineering and management positions for his\ncurrent employer. Until recently, his work has not required a security clearance, but has involved\nworking with highly sensitive, proprietary technical and commercial information. He has operated\nunder, and complied with, secrecy, proprietary information, and code of conduct agreements\nthroughout his 27-year career. To his knowledge, none of his family members have ever been\napproached by the present government of Iran concerning his life or work in the U.S. Although they\n\n4\nknow that he has been financially successful, none of them know any details of his professional life.\n  \nBased on his track record of accomplishment and his highly respected character, Applicant\nwas personally selected by the president and CEO of his company for the highly demanding position\nhe has held for the past two years with an interim security clearance. His two immediate supervisors,\nboth of whom testified in person and in writing concerning his outstanding character,\ntrustworthiness, and loyalty to the U.S., are top tier managers in the company. One is a retired three-\nstar officer who has held a security clearance for over 40 years and formerly acted as a classifying\nauthority. Both expressed supreme confidence in Applicant\u2019s ability to properly safeguard classified\nand other sensitive information, as he has done to date. He has shown his integrity by properly\nreporting program problems that arose under his cognizance even though he could have suffered\npersonally as a result. Based on having worked with him closely, they were confident that he would\npromptly disclose any questionable contacts or other potential security concerns even if that could\nresult in adverse personal consequences.\nBefore Applicant came to the U.S., he bought a two-room apartment in Teheran, Iran, with\nfinancial assistance from his father. After the Iranian revolution, his parents divorced and his mother\nmoved into the apartment. She still lives there, together with one of his sisters and his brother who\nare also unmarried. Applicant has had nothing to do with the apartment since coming to the U.S.,\nhas no remaining financial interest in it, and has no say over what happens to it. He presumes that\nonce his mother passes away, his sister and brother will continue to live there, but that is out of his\ncontrol. Applicant owns several homes in the United States, and his net worth is more than ten\nmillion dollars. He renounced any property interest in the apartment in Iran.  \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away several years ago. Although he was in Europe at the time,\nand was very saddened by his father\u2019s death, he did not travel to Iran for the funeral. His mother is\nquite old and frail. He will not go to Iran for her funeral either, when the time comes. He is never\ngoing to go back to Iran for the same reasons he sought and was granted asylum in the U.S. He\nconsiders himself to be fully an American citizen, and the Iran in which he once lived no longer\nexists. He is very much against the policies and anti-western conduct of the current Iranian\ngovernment, and would do nothing that might be of any assistance to them. He credibly testified of\nhis pride and dedication to working to enhance the national defense capabilities of the United States,\nand support for our national policies toward Iran.\nAs noted, Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Iran. He last saw her in 1979 when\nshe visited him in the U.S. His eldest sister and brother live with her in Iran now, and are also\nIranian citizens. The brother returned to Iran from studying engineering abroad shortly after\nApplicant came to the United States in 1978. The two have not seen each other since about 1976.\nApplicant speaks to his family in Iran by phone about once a year, and they only discuss how the\nfamily is doing, never anything professional or technical. The brother has worked his whole career\nas a civilian construction engineer, building buildings for a private contractor. He never worked for\nthe Iranian, or any other, government. \nApplicant\u2019s eldest sister was previously married to a U.S. citizen and lived in the U.S. with\na green card. She and her husband of twenty years had two children, who are U.S. citizens and\nresidents. She returned to Iran after their divorce, to live with and care for her mother. She visits the\nU.S. every three or four years to see her children and siblings living here. She and Applicant speak\nby telephone once or twice a year, usually during the same phone call with his mother and brother.\n\nAs administratively noticed, Iran is designated \u201cthe most active state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d by the U.S. State\n8\nDept. in Country Reports on Terrorism 2005, supra n. 3, at 173.\n5\nShe has never worked outside her home. As the eldest sibling, she became entitled to receive her\nfather\u2019s government pension when he died because her parents divorced. She and her mother subsist\ncomfortably on this pension, and Applicant sends them no money because it is illegal to send funds\ninto Iran. If the pension were cut off, Applicant\u2019s other siblings in Iran could and would support\ntheir mother. Their father\u2019s pension was restored to him when he returned to Iran as a very old man,\nmany years after he went into exile following the revolution. The pension was restored in return for\nhis not claiming any payments that might have been due to him during his absence.  \nApplicant has two sisters slightly younger than he is. One lives in the U.S. with her husband,\nwho recently retired from a career working for the U.S. Government. She moved to the U.S. in the\n1980s. She and her husband became  naturalized U.S. citizens in 1990. The other sister was educated\nin the U.S. during the early 1970s, then returned to Iran as a high-level government manager under\nthe Shah. After the revolution she was fired because of her gender, married, and had two sons who\nare medical doctors. She and her sons are now living and working in the U.S. on green cards.\nApplicant\u2019s fourth sister, born when he was a teenager, was educated in England where she met her\nIranian husband. They now live in Iran, subsisting off income from the private wealth and land\nholdings of her husband\u2019s family, but frequently travel to England. Applicant, the one sister, and his\ndeceased father, all lost their government positions working for the Shah after the revolution. None\nof his other family members ever worked for the Iranian government.\nThe facts set forth in the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice are supported by\nthe accompanying source documentation and are incorporated herein as being true. In summary,\nIran\u2019s clandestine efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction, sponsorship of international\nterrorism, intervention into Iraq\u2019s internal affairs and support for militants there, efforts to\ndestabilize the Middle East, and human rights violations against its own people are of major\nconcern. As a committed U.S. citizen, Applicant shares all of these concerns, and opposes Iranian\nactions in these regards. Two major areas of concern relevant to this security clearance decision arise\nfrom these administratively noticed facts. First, Iran is hostile to the United States and actively\nopposes western policies and goals in the Middle East. There is no direct evidence in the record\nconcerning Iranian espionage activity toward or within the U.S., but this hostile relationship supports\nthe inference that Iran would seek to damage or counter U.S. military capabilities by seeking to\nobtain classified and sensitive information when possible. Second, Iran\u2019s support for terrorist\nactivities  and its internal human rights abuses demonstrate a ruthlessness and disregard for human\n8\nlife and liberty in pursuit of anti-western and internal security policies. Iran does not recognize\nrenunciation of citizenship by those born there, and has detained and harassed naturalized U.S.\ncitizens traveling there. Applicant is aware of the dangerous nature of the regime, and intentionally\nminimizes his contact with family members there to a brief telephone call about once a year in order\nto minimize the chances of drawing government attention to their relationship to him. \nPOLICIES            \n\nAG \u00b6 2.\n9\nISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20,\n10\n2007); ISCR Case No. 04-11369 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 16, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-11414 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 5, 2007);\nISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006);  ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006).\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n11\n6\nThe revised AG that replaced Enclosure 2 of the Directive set forth adjudicative guidelines\nwhich must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions\n(DC) that may raise security concerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate\nsecurity concerns. Applicable DCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant,\ncontinue, deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information. Conditions\nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate\nsecurity concerns, under Guideline B: Foreign Influence, are set forth and discussed in the\nconclusions section below.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n9\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \"whole person concept.\" All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. While foreign\ninfluence security concerns are not based directly on the conduct of the applicant, the Appeal Board\nnevertheless recognizes that whole person analysis considering any applicable factors from the\nforegoing list, as well as other pertinent matters such as an applicant\u2019s personal attachments, the\nrelative nature and extent of the applicant\u2019s U.S. and foreign family and social ties, and his or her\nrecord of service to the U.S.  \n10\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n11\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n12\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n13\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n15\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n7\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n12\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n13\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of\n14\npersuasion (including any burden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the\ngovernment.  \n15\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial\nsecurity clearance decision shall be \"in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned,\" so a decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs set forth in the Regulation, every recommended personnel security decision must be a fair\nand impartial overall common sense decision based on all available evidence, both favorable and\n\nAG \u00b6 6.\n16\n8\n unfavorable.  The decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant or continuance\nof a security clearance or access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.  \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)            \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to\nhelp a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk\nof terrorism.16\nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, and two of his four sisters are citizens of and reside in Iran. This\nraises potential for security concerns under foreign influence disqualifying condition (FI DC) 7(a)\n(\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion\u201d). The mere existence of foreign family\nmembers is not sufficient\u2013the nature of Applicant\u2019s contact with them must be examined to\ndetermine whether it creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure or coercion. \u201cHeightened\u201d is a relative term, denoting increased risk over some normally\nexisting risk that can be said to be inherent anytime a family member lives subject to a foreign\ngovernment. One factor that heightens the risk in Applicant\u2019s case is the nature of the Iranian\ngovernment and its hostility toward U.S. interests, as compared to other countries around the world.\nWhile the Appeal Board states there is no per se rule involving any country, they have held that the\nnature of the Iranian regime creates a particularly heavy burden on applicants with close relatives\nthere to show that it is clearly in the national interest to grant them access to classified information.\nExcept for the nature of the Iranian regime, very little about Applicant\u2019s contacts with his\nIranian family members creates any heightened risk. He has normal family affection for his mother\nand siblings, but has chosen to forsake ever traveling to Iran to see them in person. Their contact is\nintentionally limited to one short telephone call per year, on average, during which only family\nwelfare is discussed. He has intentionally chosen this limited contact to minimize risk they will be\ntied to him or be subject to government attention over foreign contacts. He has more frequent contact\nwith his sisters who reside in the U.S. and are not subject to the Iranian government. This situation\nhas existed for more than 27 years, during which no member of his family has been bothered by the\nIranian government about his activities. Such government interest would have been more likely\nyears ago, when his service to the Shah\u2019s armed forces was more widely known and of potential\nconcern to those in power there. While there can be no absolute certainty, the absence of any Iranian\nexploitation,  inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion through his family contacts for 27\nyears is strong evidence that risk of it happening in the future is low.\n\n9\nFI DC 7(b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group or country by providing this\ninformation\u201d) also applies to Applicant\u2019s Iranian connections. There need not be evidence of an\nactual conflict of interest to raise security concerns. The potential conflict, arising from Applicant\u2019s\nfamily ties to Iranian citizens and residents, is sufficient to shift the burden to him to disprove its\nexistence, or otherwise mitigate the concerns. Applicant convincingly testified that he has no desire\nto help Iran, or any other foreign person, group or country, by providing sensitive information. To\nthe contrary, he strongly opposes the policies and practices of the Iranian government. The only\nconflict situation under which he might find that providing sensitive information could help a\nforeign person to whom he has connections would be the coercion, inducement, or threat scenario\nenvisioned under FI DC 7(a). As discussed above, there is very slight, if any, heightened risk of this\nhappening, and I am convinced that he would not disclose any sensitive information under those,\nor any other circumstances. He would protect the information and report the matter to company\nsecurity personnel and the FBI.\n  \nThe only other FI DC that is asserted by the Government, or addressed by any evidence in\nthe record, is FI DC 7(e) (\u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country,\nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to\nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\u201d). Applicant once owned the apartment in\nTeheran in which his mother, brother and eldest sister now reside. He has neither paid any expenses\nnor received any rent from the apartment since 1979, and has essentially abandoned any property\ninterest to his family there. The record does not support characterizing his property interest in that\napartment as \u201csubstantial,\u201d particularly in light of his substantial wealth in the U.S. He has no\ninterest in the apartment that could subject him to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation independent of an attempt at such influence through threats to the family members\nthemselves as covered by FI DC 7(a). Accordingly, FI DC 7(e) does not apply to raise any\nindependent security concerns. No other FI DC applies.\nForeign influence mitigating condition (FI MC) 8(a) (\u201cthe nature of the relationships with\nforeign persons, the country in which those persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government\nand the interests of the U.S.\u201d) does apply in part to reduce security concerns under FI DC 7(a) or (b).\nAs noted above, the nature of his relationship intentionally involves infrequent telephone\nconversations involving only family welfare matters. None of his family members now in Iran ever\nworked for any Iranian government. He and one sister who is now living in the U.S. worked only\nfor the former government of the Shah. None of his family members in Iran has been approached\nor bothered by the government there concerning Applicant\u2019s U.S. activities in the more than 27 years\nsince he was granted asylum here, including the past two during which he has held an interim\nsecurity clearance in his present position. As noted above, there is no possible absolute guarantee,\nbut such a guarantee is not required by the term, \u201cunlikely.\u201d This historical evidence is as\ncompelling as any could be to demonstrate the unlikelihood that Applicant will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of his family in Iran and those of the U.S.  \nFI MC 8(b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual\nhas such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d) also applies to mitigate any\n\nISCR Case No. 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007); ISCR Case No. 05-04648 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 24,\n17\n2007).\nISCR Case No. 04-08870 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006). This holding essentially renders this FI MC inapplicable\n18\nto telephonic communications unless contact results from dialing a wrong number.\n10\nremaining security concern from the unlikely possibility that Iran might seek to exploit Applicant\nthrough his family. Applicant permanently renounced any loyalty or obligation to Iran in 1980, and\nwith his family\u2019s blessing determined never to return there or, probably, see them again. He would\nhave been killed had he returned, and he dedicated himself to becoming an American. He honestly\nprofesses natural familial affection for his mother and, to lesser extent, his siblings. However, that\naffection is so substantially outweighed by his integrity, loyalty and sense of duty to the United\nStates, to his employer, and to his family here (as proven by his professional accomplishments,\nreputation, and character witness testimony), that he clearly would resolve any conflict that might\narise in favor of the U.S. interest. \nFI MC 8(c) (\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\u201d) does not\napply. Applicant is in regular, though intentionally infrequent, contact with his Iranian family\nmembers. There is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant\u2019s contacts with family members are\nnot casual.  Particularly in light of the Appeal Board\u2019s recent holding that \u201ccasual\u201d means\n17\nunplanned or fortuitous,  he did not rebut this presumption. Moreover, Applicant himself minimizes\n18\ncommunication to reduce any risk to his family in Iran from contact with him, in recognition that\nit could create risk of harm to them independent of any access he may or may not have to sensitive\ninformation. Accordingly, the nature of these communications is not independently mitigating,\nalthough they are relevant to determining the nature of the relationships and Applicant\u2019s loyalties\nas discussed above. \nAlthough I found no security concerns arising under FI DC 7(e) based on the apartment in\nTeheran, its minimal monetary value relative to Applicant\u2019s U.S. property holdings, and its fungible\nnature as an apartment in which his relatives can reside would completely mitigate any such\nconcerns under FI MC 8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or\nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used\neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual\u201d). None of the remaining FI MCs\napply. \nWhole Person Analysis \nI have considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and\nvulnerability in protecting our national interests. He is a mature, responsible, dedicated, long-term\nemployee of a major defense contractor. He rose through the ranks from an entry-level engineering\nposition and was hand-picked by the company\u2019s top executive from many possible candidates for\nhis current position requiring a clearance. Very senior and experienced civilian and former military\nsupervisors compellingly testified concerning Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, responsibility and\nintegrity even in the face of significant personal risk. They provided credible, independent evidence\nof his history of compliance with security procedures and regulations, protecting highly sensitive\n\n11\ntechnical and business information throughout his 28-year career, and while holding an interim\nclearance for the past two years without incident or any attempted contact from Iran. \nApplicant, his Italian-born wife, and two daughters are long-time U.S. citizens. They have\nannual telephonic contact with his mother and three of five siblings still living in Iran. All family\nmembers intentionally minimize this contact to avoid problems with the Iranian government\nindependent of any information security concerns. Two of his sisters and their families also reside\nin the U.S. All of his ten million dollars worth of assets are held in the U.S., and all of his social and\nprofessional contacts are here. Since 1978, he has never returned to Iran, even for his father\u2019s\nfuneral. He never will return to Iran while it is governed by an unfriendly regime to which he has\nno loyalty \u2013 only animosity.  \nApplicant\u2019s Iranian family\u2019s only tie to the Iranian government is his sister\u2019s receipt of her\nfather\u2019s government pension. This is not income on which they rely for survival, as the brother has\na successful private engineering career and the youngest sister married sufficiently well to provide\nany necessary resources. They live rent-free in the apartment Applicant formerly purchased with his\nfather, but in which he has neither ability nor desire to exercise any ownership interest. Applicant\u2019s\nfather also lived in exile for many years after the Iranian revolution. In old age, he returned to Iran\nand apparently settled any remaining government animosity toward his family due to former service\nto the Shah, because they restored his pension. For 27 years, Applicant\u2019s mother and some of his\nsiblings have been resident citizens of Iran while he lived in the U.S. under a grant of asylum and\neventual citizenship. They do not know the particulars of his work, but do know he has a successful\ncareer of increasingly responsible work for a major company. At no time have his family members\nbeen contacted or bothered by the Iranian government concerning Applicant\u2019s status or activities.\nShould there have been such interest, it would in all likelihood have happened before now. This\nhistory, and his family members\u2019 private and low-profile lives in Iran, combine to reduce the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress to absolute minimum levels, even taking full\nconsideration of the nature of the country involved. Considering the whole person, together with\napplicable FI DC and FI MC considerations, Applicant has met the particularly heavy burden of\nmitigating all potential security concerns arising from his family members or former property in\nIran. Accordingly, I find that it is clearly in the interest of national security to grant or continue his\naccess to classified material.\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \n            Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant\n\n12\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

T he revised Adjudicative G uidelines are\napplicable to Applicant\u2019s case.\n2\nApplicant used marijuana from June 2001 through November 2006.  He also\npurchased marijuana from June 2001 through June 2005. He used marijuana after\nsubmitting his security clearance application and during the background investigation\nfor his security clearance.  During that interview, he stated he had no plans to use\nmarijuana in the future. He failed to mitigate security concerns relating to drug\ninvolvement and personal conduct.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 16, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nMarch 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  \n2\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal\nConduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer dated and notarized on March 30, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 18, 2007. On April 20,\n2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on June 13, 2007.  The\nhearing was held as scheduled. On June 26, 2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.). I left the\nrecord open until June 22, 2007 to afford the Applicant an opportunity to submit additional material.\nTr. 17-18. He did not submit any additional material.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nAmendment of Statement of Reasons\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.b.to read, \u201cDuring the period June 2001\n\nG E 1, supra n. 1.is the basis for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherwise stated.\n3\n3\nthrough June 2005, you purchased marijuana.\u201d\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.c. to read, \u201cIn 2006, you used marijuana after\nsubmitting your security clearance application.\u201d \nApplicant did not object to the SOR amendments, and the motion was granted. Tr. 57.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant submitted a mixed response of admissions and\na denial regarding  the SOR allegations of illegal drug use. His admissions are incorporated herein\nas findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.  \nApplicant is 24 years old.  He received a bachelor of science degree in geographic science\n3\nin May 2005. He has no military service, and he has never been married. Applicant has been\nemployed by a government contractor as an assistant geographic information systems production\nmanager since January 2006. Tr. 20, 49-50. His grade point average in college was 3.45. Tr. 49. He\nis a first-time applicant for a security clearance.\nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency between June 2001 and November 2006.\nApplicant began smoking marijuana at age 18 for the following reasons:\nI mean I don\u2019t know. I mean it was just kind of something I did when I was\nhanging out with friends, usually outside. It wasn\u2019t, you know, it was something that\na couple of my buddies did and I tried it a time or two and it didn\u2019t  seem completely\nharmful. It didn\u2019t affect any sort of judgment of mine in situations and places. The\nsetting and location of where I was doing it, you know, was completely, you know,\nsafe environment for me and I felt \u2013 I never felt threatened, I never felt like it was\nsomething that I would endanger myself or anyone around me. (Describing the\nenvironment in which he smoked marijuana) Usually either on hiking trips or\nclimbing trips, just kind of something you did at the end of the day and, you know,\njust kind of [a] way of calming down. Tr. 27.\nApplicant stated his marijuana use declined in order to \u201cfocus more on school.  My you\nknow, overall drug use declined quite a bit my junior and senior year.\u201d After college, his marijuana\nuse declined even more when he began associating less with people who used marijuana. Tr 32. He\nstated \u201cit was a liberating feeling, not feeling like I had to be dependent on getting high or, you\nknow, getting marijuana or something like that.\u201d  Tr. 33-34. Also, he did not enjoy the physical\naffects of smoking marijuana and determined it was not in his best interests for employment. Tr. 47-\n48, 53-54. He has never participated in or attended any form of drug treatment or counseling\nprogram.  Tr. 37. \n\n4\nThe last time he smoked marijuana was in November 2006. This occurred after he began\nwork in January 2006 for his defense contractor employer, after he submitted his SF 86 in February\n2006, and after he was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) in July 2006 where he stated he had no plans to use marijuana in the future. Tr. 39-44. He\nknew marijuana use was a concern to the government when he began his employment. Tr. 46.\nRegarding the future non-use of marijuana, he stated at his hearing:\nI mean I can give you my word, and I guess aside from doing some sort or\nrehabilitation program, that would kind of give some sort of credence to that, I could\ndo something of that nature.  I have no problem doing that. Tr. 55.\nApplicant admitted purchasing marijuana during the period of June 2001 through June 2005, but\ndenied purchasing marijuana from June 2001 through November 2006 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The\ngovernment did not rebut Applicant\u2019s statement. \nApplicant did not submit any character evidence or work-related performance\nevaluations.\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guideline for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guideline[s]), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and\nMitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\n\n \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\n4\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR\nCase N o. 04-11463 at 2 (App. B d. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing D irective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cT his is\nsomething less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent\nc o nc lusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported b y\nsubstantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal M aritim e Com m \u2019n, 383 U .S. 607, 620 (1966).\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.\nW ashington M etro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n \u201cT he Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable\n5\nand unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circum stances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the D irective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion\nunder D irective \u00b6 E 3.1.15.\u201d ISC R Case N o. 04-10340 at 2 (A pp. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n5\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing\ncontroverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d  demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that\n4\nit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying\ncondition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship\nthat transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because\nof this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions\nunder this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions\nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual,\nrisk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision\nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any\nexpress or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above,\nI conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\n\nG uideline \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior,\n6\nincluding:\n(1) D rugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the\nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and\nother similar sub stances.\nSchedule I is contained in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 2 1  U .S.C. \u00a7 812(c).\nT he Controlled Substances Act, appears generally as 21 U .S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801 et seq.  M arijuana (Sch.\nI (c)(10)) is a Schedule I controlled substance. See U nited States v. Katz, 445 F.3d 1023 (8 th\nCir. 2006). \n G uideline \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a\n7\nlegal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d\n6\nDrug Involvement\nGuideline \u00b6 24 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning drug  involvement\n6\nstating, \u201c[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because\nit raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d\nTwo Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d  and an \u201cillegal\n7\ndrug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale,\nor distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and\n25(c).  The other six disqualifying conditions listed in Guideline \u00b6 25 are not\napplicable.\nThe two disqualifying conditions in Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply\nbecause Applicant used, possessed, and purchased marijuana. \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying\nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove\nmitigation. Guideline \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable criminal conduct\nmitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n\n In ISCR C ase N o. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. B d. D ec. 11, 2006) the Appeal B oard,\n8\nconsidered the recency analysis of an Administrative Judge, who held a hearing on July 31,\n2006, stating:\nT he Administrative Judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious\nhistory of improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was\nfamiliar with the security clearance process.  T hat histo ry included illegal\nmarijuana use two to three times a year from 1974 to 2002.  It also included the\nillegal purchase of marijuana and the use o f marijuana while holding a security\nclearance. \nAlthough Applicant did not abuse drugs while holding a security clearance, Applicant\u2019s\nillegal drug use was extensive, and his abstention from drug use was relatively brief.\n7\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation;\n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness\nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended;\n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program,\nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional.\n           Security concerns can be mitigated based on Guideline \u00b6 26(a) by showing that\nthe drug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for\ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful\nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d  ISCR\nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the evidence shows \u201ca significant\nperiod of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative\njudge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances\nor conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d Id. Guideline \u00b6\n26(a) does not fully apply because Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use occurred as recently\nas November 2006 and after he expressed an intent not to use drugs again during his July\n2006 interview with an OPM Special Agent.  His overall drug abuse was varied and long\n8\nlasting precluding the application of this mitigating condition. Based on all the facts and\ncircumstances, he has not met his burden of establishing that his drug use will not recur.\nGuideline \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse\nillegal drugs in the future. His use of marijuana in November 2006 after he signed his SF\n86 in February 2006 and stating to an OPM Special Agent he had no plans to use\nmarijuana in the future in July 2006 precludes application of any of these mitigating\nconditions.\n          Applicant offered no evidence other than his statements at his hearing that he\nintended to refrain from future drug use. He offered no corroborating evidence\n\nRetention of a security clearance is probably insufficient to ensure Applicant\u2019s\n9\nabstinence from drug abuse under these circumstances. Potential criminal liability for\npossession of drugs and adverse health, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug\nuse are among the strong motivations for remaining d rug free. N evertheless, Applicant was\nrepeatedly involved with illegal drugs from 2001 to late 2006.\n \nA d m inistrative judges \u201cmust look at the record for corroboration of Applicant\u2019s\n10\ntestimony.\u201d ISC R Case 02-03186 at 3 (App. B d. Feb. 16 , 2 0 0 6 ). M oreover, a judge may\nconsider \u201cApplicant\u2019s failure to present documentary evidence in corroboration of his denials\nand explanations.\u201d ISCR Case 01-20579 at 5 (A pp. B d. Apr. 14, 2004) (ho lding A p p licant\u2019s\nfailure to provide reasonably available co rroborative evidence may be used in common sense\nevaluation to determine whether Applicant\u2019s claims are established). In ISCR C ase 01-02677\nat 7 (App. B d. O ct. 17, 2002), the Appeal B oard explained:\nW hile lack of corroboration can be a factor in evaluating the reliability o r\nweight of evidence, lack of corroboration does not automatically render a piece\nof evidence suspect, unreliab le, or incredible. . . . Evidence that lacks\ncorroboration must be evaluated in term s o f its intrinsic believability and in\nlight of all the other evidence o f record, including evidence that tends to\nsupport it as well as evidence that tends to detract from it.  \n8\nsuggesting he was drug free or was refraining from the use of drugs.  He has not\n9\ndescribed or demonstrated he has a source for support and guidance, or other positive\nchanges. He has not shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of no drug abuse.\nMoreover, his failure to present readily available corroboration about his non-drug use\nor life altering behavior from co-workers, neighbors, family and friends is another factor\nin this decision weighing against mitigation of his drug involvement.  \n10\nPersonal Conduct\n        Guideline \u00b6 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning personal conduct\nstating, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, . . . or unwillingness to comply with\nrules regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.\u201d\n          One Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying in this case, \u201cpersonal conduct, . . .  or information about\none\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing . . . .\u201d  Guideline \u00b6 16(e).\n          Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana in November 2006 after he stated to an OPM Special\nAgent he had no plans to use marijuana in the future gives rise to questionable judgment\nand an unwillingness to follow rules.  Given this behavior on the heels of his OPM\ninterview precludes the application of any Mitigating Conditions under this Guideline.\n\nSee ISCR Case N o. 04-06242 at 2 (App. B d. June 28, 2006). \n11\n9\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\n      In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have\nconsidered the general adjudicative Guideline related to the whole person concept under\nGuideline \u00b6 2(a). As noted above, Applicant\u2019s history of drug abuse, and his actions\nconcerning illegal drug use were knowledgeable and voluntary. Although he is 24 years\nold, he was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct, especially for his\ndrug use in November 2006. The likelihood of future drug abuse remains substantial\nbecause insufficient time has elapsed since his last marijuana use, and Applicant has not\nprovided sufficient corroborative evidence of a change in his lifestyle. Nor does the\nrecord contain evidence of a good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement. Applicant\u2019s use of drugs raises the possibility of compromise of sensitive\nor classified information. Use of illegal drugs creates doubt about his judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness, and it calls into question his ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules and regulations. Abuse of drugs is not prudent or responsible.\n          Applicant presented little or no extenuating and mitigating evidence to counter the\ninformation about his drug abuse. He offered little other than his assertions that he has\nchanged his behavior and desire to maintain drug-free status in the future. On the other\nhand, he voluntarily and candidly disclosed his history of drug abuse on his February\n2006 SF 86 and in his July 2006 OPM interview. Applicant provided the only record\nevidence showing his drug abuse. The absence of evidence of any prior violation of his\nemployer\u2019s rules or requirements, and his sincerity about making future progress weigh\nin his favor. \n       In sum, Applicant did not demonstrate that he will remain drug free. There is\ninsufficient evidence about improvement regarding his understanding of his situation.\nHe did not receive counseling or therapy, and he may not have a clear perception of, or\nunderstanding about, how to avoid problematic situations or why he abused drugs. The\nrecency of his drug abuse, especially his marijuana use after applying for a security\nclearance weighed most heavily against him. The evidence of his rehabilitative efforts\nis insufficient to resolve my doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to drug involvement. The evidence leaves me with doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \n         I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and\n11\nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative\nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guideline. Applicant has\nnot mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he\nis not eligible for access to classified information.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n         Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\n          Against Applicant\nDECISION\n          In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security\nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nRobert J. Tuider\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Mendez, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on September \n16, 2005. On June 8, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for financial considerations \nand personal conduct under Guidelines F and E for Applicant. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response.  He denied all \nallegations with explanation.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing.  Department counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on October 26, 2007.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material \n(FORM) on November 16, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections, \nFebruary 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  \nDepartment Counsel mailed additional material to Applicant at the same mailing \naddress on December 10, 2007.  Applicant was provided an additional 30 days to \nrespond with additional information.  Applicant did not respond to the FORM or the \nadditional material.  The case was assigned to me on January 15, 2008.  Based on a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nDepartment counsel in the FORM moved to amend the SOR to add a second \nallegation, 2.b, under Guideline E, based on falsifications in Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nSOR.  Specifically, the new allegation is that Applicant knew of four debts that he stated \nin his answer to the SOR that he did not have knowledge. \n \nApplicant was provided in the FORM an opportunity to respond to the \namendment of the SOR.  Applicant did not raise an objection to amending the SOR.  \nThe SOR is amended to add allegation 2.b under Guideline E as requested by \nDepartment Counsel. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old senior information technology security manager for a \ndefense contractor.  He has worked with this contractor since 2005.  He retired after 18 \nyears of active Army service in 2001.  Between 2001 and 2005, he worked as a senior \nsystems engineer for defense contractors.  He and his first wife divorced after a 23 year \nmarriage in 2002.  They had two children who are now in their twenties.  Applicant notes \nthat some of the debts in the SOR were incurred by his first wife while he was stationed \noverseas, and also because she did not pay their bills.  He remarried in 2004.  He held \na security clearance while on active duty in the Army. (Item 23; Response to SOR, \nundated) \n \nApplicant responded \u201cNO\u201d to question 24 on his security clearance application \nwhich asked had he ever been charged with or convicted of an offense(s) related to \nalcohol or drugs.  Records show that in April 1994, while on active duty, Applicant was \narrested and charged by civilian authorities with driving under the influence.  He was \nfound not guilty of driving under the influence but guilty of reckless driving.  He paid a \nfine.  Applicant stated he had not been drinking alcohol that night but had taken a cold \nmedicine that contained alcohol.  In responding to the question on the security \nclearance application, Applicant believed he did not have to list the offense since it \nhappened over 14 years earlier and he thought outside the time line for listing these \ntype offenses.  He states he was told he only had to go back ten years.  (Item 2, \nparagraph 2. a; Item 10) \n \nApplicant claims in his answer to the SOR that he did not know about some of \nthe debts listed.  The debts include a debt of $16,660 to a bank in collection (allegation \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.d); a debt for $117 for satellite television service (allegation 1.e); a debt to a credit \nunion for $3,224 (allegation 1.q); and a bank debt for $9,978 (allegation 1.s).   \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2004.  He listed unsecured \nliabilities of over $194,000 with $6,700 in assets. (Item 20)  The bankruptcy trustee \nrecommended dismissal of the bankruptcy because the unsecured debts were \nconsumer debt; Applicant is capable of paying on his debts based on his income and \nwork potential; the purchases causing his debts exceeded his ability to pay at the time \nthe debts were incurred; he could contribute to debt payment without being deprived of \nthe necessities of living; he qualifies for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy; and he has not \nparticipated in a debt repayment program.  The trustee questioned Applicant\u2019s good \nfaith in resolving debt. (Item 21)  The bankruptcy was dismissed based on the \nrecommendation of the trustee. (Item 22)  Applicant claims his former wife and their \ndivorce caused his financial problems leading to bankruptcy, and that the trustee \nrecommended dismissal of the bankruptcy because he was continuing to support his \ncollege student daughter. (Item 2)  \n \nThe SOR lists 18 delinquent debts totaling over $105,000.  These debts include a \ncollection account for a utility for $89 (1.b); a medical debt for $135 (1.c); a credit card \ndebt to a bank for $16,660 (1.d); a satellite television account for $117 (1.e); a cable \ndebt for $143 (1.f); another cable debt of $431 (1.g); a state lien for child support for \n$2,910 (1.h); a credit card debt for $27,000 (1.i); a credit card collection account for \n$7,051 (1.j); a consumer loan for $544 (1.k); a collection account for $13,000 (1.l); two \ncredit card accounts to the same company for $1,634 (1.m) and $2,413 (1.n); three \ncredit accounts to the same credit union for $7,666 (1.o), $11,000 (1.p), and $3,224 \n(1.q); another delinquent credit account for $1,039 (1.r), and a bank credit card debt for \n$9,978 (1.s).  All of the above delinquent debts are listed on and confirmed by various \ncredit reports.  The credit reports also show Applicant\u2019s debt total has risen from \n$68,000 in 2001, to $74,000 in 2003, to $86,000 in 2004, to over $100,000 in 2007.  As \nnoted, the SOR lists delinquent debts of over $105,000. (See, Items 14, 16, 17, 25, 26, \nand supplemental FORM material, December 10, 2007)   \n \nApplicant denied any knowledge of the debts in 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.j, 1.l, 1.q, 1.r, \nand 1.s.  He did not present any information concerning any inquiry he made about the \ndebts.  He stated the cable debts in 1.f and 1.g were paid in full but he does not have \nreceipts.  Applicant stated he was out of the country on military assignment when he \nwas ordered to pay child support.  He contacted the child welfare office upon returning \nand set up an automatic payroll deduction for the child support.  He has continued to \npay child support even though he is no longer required to do so.  He presented no \ninformation concerning support payments or any efforts to pay past due child support \nthat may have accumulated while he was overseas.  He discussed the credit card debt \nlisted at 1.i with the creditor to have them split the debt between he and his wife.  The \ncreditor refused and Applicant stated he would only pay his part of the debt.  He has \npresented no information to show any payment of any part of this debt.  He claims the \ndebt listed at 1.j is his wife\u2019s and not his debt and was charged off before he returned \nfrom overseas.  Applicant claims the credit card debts at 1.m and 1.n are the same debt \n\n \n4 \n \n \nand that he paid the debt.  He presented no information to verify the debts are the same \nor that they have been paid in full.  In addition, on his statement to security \ninvestigators, he acknowledged he owed both debts. (Item 18 at 3)  Applicant stated the \ncredit union debt at 1.o is the same debt as listed at 1.k.  The debts are for different \namounts and the account numbers are not the same on the credit reports.  Applicant \nclaims the debt at 1.p is for a car purchased by his former wife and he is not responsible \nfor the debt.  He presented no information on any contact with the creditors on these \ndebts. \n \nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he did not know about the debts at \n1.d, 1.e, 1. q, and 1.s.  All four debts are listed on various credit reports dated as early \nas 2001.  In addition, he acknowledged the four debts in a statement to security \ninvestigators in 2004.  (Item 18, statement dated February 13, 2004, at 3-4). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are a security concern raising Financial \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts), FC DC \u00b6 19(b) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible \nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt), FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations), and FC DC \u00b619(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis).  Applicant accumulated delinquent \ndebts because of an unwillingness to pay his financial obligations.  The debt total has \nrisen over the years with no indication of any attempt to pay the debts.  The debts \nappear to be for normal consumer items which indicate he may be spending beyond his \nmeans. \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \n\n \n6 \n \n \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  Most of the delinquent debts have \nnot been addressed by Applicant and are listed on the most recent credit report.  The \ndebts are still not paid so they are current debts.  There are a number of delinquent \ndebts from various sources so they are not infrequent.  The debts seem to be ordinary \ncredit card debts, telephone bills, department store accounts, or loans.  There is no \nevidence they were incurred under unusual circumstances.  An examination of the \ndebts by the bankruptcy trustee shows they are largely consumer debts.  Since they are \ncurrent debts that have not been paid, they cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  Applicant claims some of his \ndebts were incurred by his wife without his knowledge while he was overseas.  He \npresented no information to establish that the debts were incurred by his wife.  He also \ndid not show any actions he took to resolve the debts once he returned from overseas.  \nApplicant also claims his debts were caused by his divorce.  He presented no \ninformation to show how the divorced caused his debts.  In fact, the credit reports show \nhe incurred delinquent debt years before the divorce, and continued to incur delinquent \ndebt after the divorce.  He did not establish he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances, so the mitigating condition does not apply. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control).  Applicant presented no information of financial counseling, so this \nmitigating condition does not apply. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant presented no information to show he has a plan to pay the debts or any action \nthat he has taken to pay his debts.  There is no indication Applicant acted responsibly \ntowards his debts or that the situation is under control.  In fact, the opposite seems to be \ntrue, his finances are not under control and that he has not acted responsibly.  The \nindication is that he just did not pay his debts, the debts continued to accumulate, and \nhe continued to incur more debt.  There is no indication of a good faith effort to pay \ncreditors or resolve debts.  Applicant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate \nsecurity concerns for financial considerations. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance process depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s potentially inaccurate \nanswers to a question concerning an alcohol-related charge on his security clearance \napplication and his SOR response that he had no knowledge of delinquent debts raise \nsecurity concerns under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (the \ndeliberate omission concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations determine security eligibility or trustworthiness). \n \n \nApplicant denied intentional falsification.  He believed he only had to list alcohol-\nrelated offenses that happened in the last ten years.  He claims to have asked \nsupervisors and other about the process and was informed that he had to go back only \nten years.  Since the offense was over 14 years earlier, he did not include it.  However, \nin his response to the SOR, he claims he had no knowledge of four debts.  The debts \nare clearly listed on credit reports and he acknowledged the debts in a statement he \nprovided security investigators.  It is clear that he knew of the four debts and his \nstatements on the debts in response to the SOR are false.  While there is a security \nconcern for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \ndocument or oral statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance, \nevery omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is not a falsification.  A \nfalsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and \nwillfully.  Applicant knew of the four debts when he completed his response to the SOR, \nso his false responses as to knowledge of the debts were knowing and willful.  The \nquestion concerning alcohol-related charges is clear and straight forward and uses the \nword \u201cever\u201d and does not limit the time of concern.  Applicant established a pattern of \naction in answering questions falsely or providing false information.  Applicant has \ndemonstrated on two separate occasions that he deliberately provided false information \nin the security clearance process with intent to deceive.  I find against Applicant as to \nPersonal Conduct.   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \n\n \n8 \n \n \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s Army service and many years holding a security \nclearance.  However, Applicant has not taken action to resolve his past due debts.  His \nindifferent attitude and lack of actions shows he is not trustworthy, responsible, or \nexercises good judgment.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \narising from his finances and personal conduct.  Clearance is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.s:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPatrick Gromek, Personal Representative\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 50-year-old training instructor for the Army employed by a defense contractor,\nmitigated financial security concerns arising from IRS tax delinquencies for four tax years arising\nbecause of underemployment for a four year period after he retired from the Army. Payments have\nbeen made and are continuing under a payment plan for the $7,500 balance due worked out by\nApplicant and the IRS. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn or about May 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\n\n2\nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, and\nsubject to the revised Adjudicative Guidelines effective September 1, 2006, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nOn June 25, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. The\nmatter was assigned to me on July 23, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on August 30, 2007, for\na hearing on September 12, 2007, and held that day. The government offered five exhibits. Applicant\noffered eight into evidence at the hearing. All of the offered exhibits were admitted in evidence\nwithout objection. The transcript was received on September 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted with explanation six of the eight SOR allegations relating to a 1992\nbankruptcy and delinquent debts to the IRS. He denied two allegations relating to state taxes. After\na complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as a training instructor\nin the intelligence field since November 2004. He served 22 years in the Army and retired in 1998.\nFor the five years between his retirement and his present employment he had only occasional work\nas an independent contractor which was not remunerative. In large measure, that led to his current\nfinancial problems. \nAn analysis of the debts alleged in the SOR from testimony and documentary evidence\nsubmitted in the record indicates as follows:\n1. Par. 1.a.: Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 1992 as a result of a divorce.\n \n2. Par. 1.b.: Applicant was discharged in bankruptcy in July 1992. Some of the debts were\npaid, others were discharged without payment. \n3. Par. 1.c.: An IRS tax lien for 1999 taxes in the amount of $3,909 was filed against him.\n4. Par. 1.d.: An IRS tax lien for 2000 taxes in the amount of $3,366 was filed against him.\n \n5. Par. 1.e.: Applicant is indebted to IRS for tax year 2005 in the amount of $599. \n6. Par. 1.f.: Applicant is indebted to IRS for tax year 2006 in the amount of $1,076. \n7. Par. 1.g.: Applicant was indebted to the State of Arizona in the amount of $288 for 1999.\n\n3\n8. Par. 1.h.: Applicant was indebted to the State of Arizona in the amount of $249 for 2000.\nDuring the period 1999 to 2004, when Applicant was working as an independent contractor\nno taxes were withheld and he should have received 1099s from his employers but often did not.\nThus, he fell behind in payment of his 1999 and 2000 taxes and liens were placed by IRS. He has\nsince worked out a plan with IRS to resolve the debts from these two tax years. He has been paying\non them through voluntary withholdings from his salary (Exhs. A, C, and D), but now they are being\nresolved through garnishment by payroll deduction in the amount of $130 per month (Exhs. G and\nH). The net result is that his total tax debt is now approximately $7,500.\nApplicant is also negotiating a payment plan for the two recent tax years, 2005 and 2006. He\nfiled the tax returns but did not have sufficient funds to pay all the taxes but has made partial\npayments and is making voluntary payments of $100 per month (Tr. 27 and Exh. D). \nAs to the Arizona tax debts, Applicant submitted documentation to establish that he does not\nowe those state taxes (Exh 5). The government concedes that the debts are not owed (Tr. 8).\nApplicant has a BS degree in Information Technology and an associates degree in\nIntelligence Operations both of which he earned in 2005. He is paying $240 per month on his student\nloan (Exh. 3). \nApplicant is highly regarded by his employer for his work ethic and skills (Tr.40). His present\nwork involves application of skills he learned while on active duty with the Army. He is highly\nregarded by the Army office for which he provides support services (Exh. E). The chief executive\nofficer of his employer served as his personal representative at the hearing and offered his support\nin helping him further reduce his tax indebtedness through the use of his own CPA firm (Tr.40).\nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is $65,000 and his Army retirement is $12,000 per annum. He is\ndivorced and has two grown children one of whom is in the Army. His present income and financial\nobligations are such that he can resolve his outstanding tax debts and live without incurring\nadditional debts which he could not pay (Exh. 3). He intends to increase the payments now being\nmade to accelerate the payment of the tax debts. \nApplicant has made good faith efforts to resolve delinquent debts arising from causes many\nof which were beyond his control.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the\n\n4\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.  Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG \u00b6 2 a). Security clearances are\ngranted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No.\n10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2 b) \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) and factors in the Directive, I\nconclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concerns under Guideline\nF because an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude a history of not meeting financial obligations (AG \u00b6 19 c) and evidence of inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts (AG \u00b6 19 a). Mitigating Conditions (MC) that might apply include the\nfact that the behavior happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability , trustworthiness, or good judgment (AG \u00b6 20 a), or the\nperson has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts (AG \u00b6\n20 d). I find that the evidence justifies application of the cited mitigating conditions to Applicant.\nThe fact that Applicant has had one Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1992 raises possible concerns\nabout a pattern of financial problems. However, that was 15 years ago while he was in the Army and\nunder circumstances not likely to be repeated. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant\nimpressed me at the hearing as a credible, hard-working person whose delinquent debts arose in large\nmeasure as a result of his under-employment for five years Those conditions are unlikely to recur\nas he has a well-paying job with a company that is very supportive and appreciative of his work. He\n\n5\nhas taken significant corrective steps and established to my satisfaction that he is now financially\nresponsible and will remain so.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that a security clearance should be granted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge\n",

The record\ndid not establish conduct cognizable under Guideline E: Personal Conduct.

He answered the SOR 4 April 2007, and requested a decision\n1\nwithout hearing.

DOHA assigned the case to me 19 June\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate the admissions as\nfindings of fact.2\nApplicant\u2014a 28-year-old mechanical engineer employed by a defense contractor since June\n2003\u2014seeks to retain the access to classified information he has held since approximately\nSeptember 2004.\nApplicant first applied for a clearance in November 2003 (Item 4), truthfully claimed to have\nno history of drug use, and was granted his clearance in September 2004. On 12 December 2005,\nApplicant used marijuana at a concert when it was offered to him. On 21 December 2005, he was\nsubjected to a random drug screen at work and tested positive for marijuana use. His employer\nsuspended him from work and ordered him to undergo a substance abuse evaluation. He returned\nto work three weeks later when he passed a subsequent drug screen and was found by the substance\nabuse evaluation to not require further treatment. In approximately September 2006, he passed a\nrandom drug screen at work.\nIn late January 2006, Applicant annotated his clearance application to reflect his drug\ninvolvement, and the company resubmitted the application to the government. The application (Item\n4) is the only record evidence supporting issuance of the SOR.\nIn his Answer (Item 3), Applicant acknowledged exercising poor judgment in trying\nmarijuana at the concert when it was offered to him. However, he credibly stated he had made a\nconscious effort since to avoid similar situations where illegal drugs might be present. He also\ncredibly asserted that he had no desire or inclination to use any drug again, and pledged not to do so.\n\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct is wholly inapplicable to the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct did not\n3\ninvolve deliberate omission. . . [\u00a7 16.(a)], deliberately providing false or misleading information . . . [\u00a7 16.(b)], personal\nconduct . . . that creates a vulnerability . . . [\u00a7 16.(e)], violation of a written or recorded commitment . . . [\u00a7 16.(f)], or\nassociation with persons involved in criminal activity [\u00a7 16.(g)]. The closest Applicant\u2019s conduct gets to implicating\nGuideline E is credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas . . . [\u00a7 16.(c)] and credible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline . . . [\u00a7 16.(d)][Emphasis added.]. Applicant\u2019s\nmisconduct is completely circumscribed by the adjudicative criteria delineated by the disqualifying and mitigation\nconditions enumerated under Guideline H: Drug Involvement.\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\nAny drug abuse [\u00a7 25.(a)];\n5\n3\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline H (Drug Involvement).3\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.4\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by demonstrating\nthat Applicant used marijuana in December 2005,  tested positive for marijuana use later that\n5\n\nTesting positive for illegal drug use [\u00a7 25.(b)];\n6\nAny illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance [\u00a7 25.(g)];\n7\nThe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely\n8\nto recur or does not cast doubt n the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment [\u00a7\n26.(a)][Emphasis supplied];\nA demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: . . . (2) changing or avoiding the\n9\nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; . . . [\u00a7 26.(b)].\n4\nmonth,  and did so after being granted a clearance in September 2004.  However, Applicant\n6\n7\nmitigated the security concerns, by demonstrating that the use was infrequent and under\ncircumstances unlikely to recur,  and further demonstrated intent to not abuse drugs in the future.\n8\n9\nThe record reflects that Applicant used marijuana on a single occasion, in a concert setting, when\nthe drug was passed to him. The drug does not appear to have been passed to him by friends, but by\nfellow concert-goers. While Department Counsel fairly characterizes Applicant\u2019s use as \u201crecent,\u201d\nthis term has less meaning under the new adjudicative criteria, where the corresponding language\n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago. . .\u201d [\u00a7 26.(a)], is used in the disjunctive with language that clearly\napplies to Applicant. Further, given the minimal marijuana use by Applicant, his abstention from\nmarijuana use from December 2005 to June 2007\u2014nearly 18 months\u2014is an appropriate period of\nabstinence [\u00a7 26.(b)]. Applicant used marijuana once in an admitted exercise of poor judgment, and\nsuffered consequences, both at work and with regard to his clearance, that clearly sobered him and\nimpressed upon him the importance of refraining from drug use in the future. On this record, it is\nextremely unlikely that Applicant would return to illegal drug use. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline\nH. for Applicant.\nThe government failed to establish a Guideline E case. There is no aspect of Applicant\u2019s\nconduct that is not completely addressed by the adjudicative criteria for drug involvement, and the\ndrug involvement did not occur under any circumstances implicating the more substantive criteria\nunder personal conduct. I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\n\n5\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nGE 1 (Electronic Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance Application is dated September 14, 2005, on the\n1\nfirst page, and subsequent signature release page).\nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR was received at DOHA on April 9, 2007.  \n2\n2\nOn September 14, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86).   On March 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  On May\n1, 2007, Department Counsel filed a Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons adding additional\nallegations under Guideline B, Paragraph 2.\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), and Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \nIn an answer notarized on April 6, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and\nasked for a hearing.   Applicant responded to the Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons on\n2\nJune 11, 2007.  The case was assigned to me on May 9, 2007.  On May 21, 2007, DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing, scheduling the hearing on June 26, 2007.  The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled.  The government submitted three documentary exhibits that were admitted as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 without objection.  I took administrative notice of nine\nadditional documents offered by the government as discussed, infra.  The Applicant testified and\nsubmitted four documents that were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D without\nobjection.  Applicant submitted additional documents post-hearing that were collectively marked as\nAE E and admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript on July 6, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the Statement of Reasons and noted Applicant had\nalready answered his Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons.  Without objection, I granted the\nmotion.  Tr. 10-12.\nAdministrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Exhibit (Exs.) I through\nIX.  Without objection, I took administrative notice of the Exs. I through IX.  Tr. 17-19.\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004));\nMcLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most\n\n3\ncommon basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well\nknown or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co.\n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). I took administrative notice of various\nfacts derived from Exs. I through IX and discussed infra.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted with explanation the allegations contained in the original SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.\nthrough 1.d. and 2.a. and 2.b.  As to the amended SOR, Applicant admitted with explanation the\nallegations contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c. through 2.f. except for SOR \u00b6 2.e.  As to \u00b6 2.e., he noted that\nthe person alleged as his cousin is not his cousin, but rather his wife\u2019s cousin.  His admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact, and his clarifying remarks about security concerns will be\ndiscussed in further detail, infra.\nI took into account Applicant\u2019s native language is Russian. Applicant\u2019s Personal\nRepresentative also served as a translator when it was helpful or necessary.\nApplicant is a 58-year-old senior database/applications development specialist employed by\na defense contractor since March 2004.  He has not previously held a clearance. He testified during\nthe hearing, and I found his testimony to be credible.\nApplicant was born in 1948 in Moscow, Russia, then part of the United Soviet Socialist\nRepublics (USSR).  He grew up in Russia and completed his education there, served two years of\ncompulsory military service in the USSR Army from 1971 to 1973 and later obtained a master\u2019s\ndegree in physics from a prestigious Russian university in June 1976. After college, he worked as\nan engineer. He is eligible to receive a pension of approximately $100 a month from the Russian\ngovernment in approximately a year and a half.  However, because of the small amount of money\ninvolved and the bureaucracy involved in collecting such a pension, he does not intend to apply for\nit.  Tr. 33.\nApplicant\u2019s wife, like him, was born, raised and educated in Russia.  They married in\nMoscow in October 1981 and have three children, a 25-year-old daughter, and two twin sons, who\nare 23 years old.  Applicant\u2019s three children were all born in Russia.  Fulfilling a life-long dream,\nApplicant and his family immigrated to the U.S. in February 1997. GE 1, Tr. 40. Applicant became\na naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2003, and received his U.S. passport in June 2004.  Applicant\u2019s\nwife and three children are all naturalized U.S. citizens. GE 1, Tr. 46. At the time Applicant and his\nfamily moved to the U.S., his daughter was 14 years old and his twin sons were 13 years old.  His\nchildren are all university graduates and are gainfully employed in promising careers.  One of his\nsons is employed by a government contractor as a programmer and is currently undergoing a\nbackground investigation for a security clearance.\nAmong the concerns alleged in the SOR were that Applicant and his wife exercised dual\ncitizenship with Russia and the U.S., that one of his children is a citizen of Russia and resides with\nhim in the U.S., that he held a Russian passport with an expiration date of December 14, 2006, that\nhe used his Russian passport in lieu of his U.S. passport in July 2004 and April 2006, and that he\nintended to renew his Russian passport.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d., 2.a. and 2.c.)  None of\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family members residing in the U.S. to include his wife and three children\nhave valid Russian passports.  Tr. 40.\nIn addition to expressing a willingness to renounce his Russian citizenship, Applicant has\nundertaken the formal process to renounce his Russian citizenship. This is a lengthy process which\nincludes submission of numerous documents and a $400.00 processing fee.  Tr. 50-51, AE E.\nApplicant also submitted excerpts from the Russian Embassy website that stated he was required to\nhave a valid Russian passport in order to renounce his Russian citizenship and that as a dual citizen,\nhe was required to use his Russian passport to travel to and from Russia.  AE E.  It was this guidance\nthat prompted him to use his Russian passport in July 2004 and April 2006 after receiving his U.S.\npassport, and previously state that he intended to renew his Russian passport.  \nHis Russian passport expired on December 14, 2006.  He submitted a copy of his expired\nRussian passport with his application to renounce his Russian citizenship, and at present does not\nintend or desire to renew his Russian passport.  Tr. 36-37, AE E.  Until he began the process of\napplying for a security clearance, he was unaware of the prohibition against holding a U.S. passport\nand a foreign passport.  Being aware of the requirements, he has no desire to renew or hold a Russian\npassport, and desires to comply with DoD security clearance guidelines.  Tr. 43-44.\nApplicant traveled to Russia in 1999, 2000, 2004, and 2006, and as previously noted used\nhis Russian passport during the later two visits.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., and 2.b.)  In 1999, he traveled to\nRussia to see his mother after she experienced two strokes that left her paralyzed.  In 2000, he\ntraveled to Russia to attend his mother\u2019s funeral.  In 2004, he traveled to Russia to attend his father\u2019s\nfuneral.  In 2006, he traveled to Russia to make arrangements to sell his late father\u2019s apartment.\nFollowing the death of his father, he has no immediate relatives in Russia.  \nApplicant adamantly stated he has no intention of ever returning to Russia stating, \u201cI live[d]\nfor 25 years to leave Russia. For what I will come back (sic)?\u201d  Tr. 40, 57.  Applicant\u2019s wife is\nemployed by a U.S. government agency and \u201cpassed a thorough background investigation as part of\nher employment requirement.  As part of her job duties, she regularly deals with Sensitive but\nUnclassified (SBU) . . . data.\u201d  AE E.  She first worked for this U.S. government agency as a sub-\ncontractor in November 2002 until she was hired on as a full-time employee in October 2005.  AE\nE.\nAdditional concerns raised under Guideline B were Applicant\u2019s wife is a dual citizen of the\nU.S. and Russia, his brother-in-law is a resident citizen of Russia, his cousin is a resident citizen of\nRussia, and his best friend is a resident citizen of Russia. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c. though 2.f.)  As previously\nnoted, Applicant\u2019s wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen and works for a government agency that\nconducted a background investigation on her that resulted in her being granted access to sensitive\ninformation.  Her Russian citizenship is based on her birth in Russia.  Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is\na 51-year-old bank programmer.  Contrary what was alleged, he does not have a resident citizen\ncousin in Russia.  Rather the person identified in the SOR is his wife\u2019s 70-year-old cousin.  His\nwife\u2019s cousin is a widow and works as an assembly line worker in an optical factory that makes\ncameras.  His \u201cbest friend\u201d is a childhood friend who is 59 years old and works in a library doing\nmaintenance work such as minor plumbing, electrical and furniture repairs.  Applicant telephones\nhis friend \u201cabout one time a month.\u201d  Tr. 39.\n\n5\nApplicant has no financial or other interests in Russia, no connection to the Russian\ngovernment, no contacts with Russian citizens other than limited contact with his wife\u2019s brother and\ncousin, and monthly contact with his childhood friend.  His financial interests, his personal interests,\nand his emotional commitments are all in the U.S.  Applicant knows to report to proper authority any\nefforts to coerce classified information from him.   All of his real and personal property is in the\nU.S., which includes a home and automobiles.  Applicant conducts all his banking in the U.S.  He\nexercises his right to vote in the U.S. and enjoys all other privileges of being a U.S. citizen.  \nApplicant provided one work-related reference letter from his company vice president, who\ndescribed Applicant\u2019s performance in a very positive light.  In particular, he stated Applicant is\n\u201copen and honest in his dealings with individuals, his co-workers and the company.\u201d  He further\nopined Applicant could make a greater contribution if given a security clearance and did not question\nApplicant\u2019s dedication to the U.S., \u201cand his desire to fulfill the American dream, exercise the\nfreedoms and liberties we enjoy, and contribute to the well being of our nation.\u201d  AE A.\nRussia has an active, recent, and ongoing collecting program targeting the U.S. and has been\nthe target of terrorist activity in recent years.  Russia imposes rigid visa requirements on foreign\ntravelers entering, and traveling within their country.  Russia is a nominal democracy with a mixed\nhuman rights record.  However, the U.S. and Russia cooperate over a broad spectrum of foreign\npolicy issues, particularly counter-terrorism efforts.  Exs. I through IX.\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure\n2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n3\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable,\n4\n[evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides]\nwhether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App.\nBd. July 6, 2006). \n6\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to the relevant adjudicative guidelines are set forth\nand discussed in the Conclusions section below.  Since the protection of the national security is the\nparamount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that\nthe issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching\nthis decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n3\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive. Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nUnder Guideline C, a security concern may exist when an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nDirective \u00b6 9.\nApplicable is Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10(a) exercise of any\nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . .  .  Applicant\u2019s\nRussian passport expired in December 2006.  He used his Russian passport after obtaining his U.S.\npassport in 2003 and 2004 when he traveled to Russia to attend his father\u2019s funeral and sell his\nfather\u2019s apartment.  Per information submitted by Applicant and not challenged by Department\nCounsel, Applicant was required under Russian law to use his Russian passport to enter Russia\nbecause he held dual citizenship.  \nUnder Russian law, Applicant\u2019s Russian citizenship did not expire when he became a U.S.\ncitizen.  Rather, Applicant must undergo a lengthy and costly process to renounce his Russian\ncitizenship.  Applicant\u2019s use of his Russian passport occurred before he applied for a security\nclearance and before he became aware of DoD restrictions on the use of foreign passports.  Inasmuch\nas Applicant has no immediate family in Russia and no property or other interests in Russia and\nwhose life is fully vested in the U.S., he has no intent to ever return to Russia.  As noted, Applicant\nhas taken the additional step of formally renouncing his Russian citizenship.\nIn light of the above, Applicant is able to invoke Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition\n(FP MC) 11(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country;\nMC 11(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship; and MC 11(e)\nthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated.  As noted by Department Counsel in his closing argument, \u201c. . . it appears that . . . for\nGuideline C, there\u2019s an argument to be made that Applicant has mitigated the prima facie concerns\nof the government.\u201d  Tr. 59.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Directive \u00b6 6.\nContacts with citizens of other countries, or financial interests in other countries, are also\nrelevant if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.\nCommon sense suggests that the stronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a\n\n8\nperson is to being manipulated if the relative is brought under control or used as a hostage by a\nforeign intelligence or security service.\nThe government established a potential case under this Guideline by demonstrating that\nApplicant\u2019s two sons are citizens of Russia and reside with him, that his wife is a dual citizen of\nRussia and the U.S., that his brother-in-law is a resident citizen of Russia, and his childhood friend\nis a resident citizen of Russia.  It was also established that Applicant traveled to Russia in 1999,\n2000, 2004, and 2006.  The SOR alleged Applicant had a cousin, who was a resident citizen of\nRussia, but this allegation was determined to be incorrect as the cousin referred to was his wife\u2019s\ncousin rather than his cousin.  \nThese facts trigger application of Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) 7(a)\ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; FI DC 7(b) connections to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and FI DC 7(d) sharing\nliving quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates\na heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nApplicant, his wife and three children immigrated to the U.S. in February 1997 where they\nhave remained for the last ten years.  At the time Applicant moved here, his children were teenagers.\nAll three children have since completed their education to include graduating from university and\nare all embarked on successful careers.  All four family members are naturalized U.S. citizens.  With\nthe passing of his father in 2004, Applicant has no living immediate family members remaining in\nRussia.  Applicant\u2019s previous travel to Russia was prompted by the illness or deaths of his parents,\nand need to sell his father\u2019s apartment after he died.  Hence there is no longer a requirement for\nApplicant to travel to Russia.  \nThe closest connection Applicant has with a Russian resident citizen is his childhood friend.\nHe does maintain limited contact with two Russian resident citizen relatives who are relatives of his\nwife.  The Russian passports of Applicant, his wife and three children have expired and are no longer\nvalid.  Applicant is a highly respected employee, who is making a significant contribution to his\ncompany.  Applicant\u2019s wife has undergone a background investigation in conjunction with her\nemployment at a U.S. government agency and has been granted access to sensitive information.  In\nshort, Applicant\u2019s life is fully vested in the U.S.\nThe facts presented in this case warrant application of Foreign Influence Mitigating\nConditions (FI MC):  8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that\nit is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of\na foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; and FI MC\n8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to\nthe foreign person, group, government or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n\n ISCR Case No. 02-30864 at 4 (App. Bd.

Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that eighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in\nforeign influence cases).  \n9\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed\npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept\nunder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that a Judge may find in favor of\nan applicant where no specific mitigating conditions apply.   Moreover, \u201c[u]nder the whole person\n5\nconcept, the administrative judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life\nseparately, in a piecemeal manner.  Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility\nby considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.\u201d   The directive lists nine\n6\nadjudicative process factors (APF) which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign\ninfluence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior\nchanges, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.  In addition to the\n7\neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the\nclearance decision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.    \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s\npersonal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his [or\nher] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the\nfacts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  In that same decision,\nthe Appeal Board commended the whole person analysis in ISCR Case No. 03-02878 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJune 7, 2006), which provides:\nApplicant has been in the U.S for twenty years and a naturalized citizen for seven.\nHer husband is also a naturalized citizen, and her children are U.S. citizens by birth.\nHer ties to these family members are stronger than her ties to family members in\nTaiwan.  She has significant financial interests in the U.S. , and none in Taiwan.  She\ntestified credibly that she takes her loyalty to the U.S. very seriously and would\ndefend the interests of the U.S.  Her supervisors and co-worker assess her as very\nloyal and trustworthy.  \nSeveral circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis.  First and more\nimportantly, Russia has an active, recent, and ongoing collection program targeting the U.S.  Second,\nApplicant has connections to Russia through his wife\u2019s relatives and his childhood friend.  Third,\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n8\n10\nApplicant is eligible for a nominal pension from the Russian government.  There is no evidence in\nthe record to suggest Applicant or his wife provide any support to anyone in Russia.\nThere are many other countervailing, positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life as a U.S. citizen\nthat weigh towards granting his clearance.  His Russian passport is expired.  He has strong links or\nconnections to the United States: (1) Applicant, his wife, and three children are all naturalized U.S.\ncitizens and reside in the U.S., (2) Applicant\u2019s three children immigrated to the U.S. when they were\nteenagers and spent their formative years in the U.S., were educated in the U.S. to include\ncompleting university degrees.  Each child resides in the U.S., is hard working, productive,\nsuccessful, and making positive contributions to society; (3) Applicant and his family have resided\nin the U.S. for ten years, (4) Applicant\u2019s wife works for a U.S. government agency where she holds\na responsible position and has successfully gone through a background investigation, (5) Applicant\nholds a responsible position working for a defense contractor and is highly regarded by his employer,\n(6) all of Applicant\u2019s real and personal property are in the U.S. to include owning a home.  All his\nfinancial connections are in the United States, (7) he exercises all rights of U.S. citizenship including\nthe right to vote, and (8) he credibly stated that she would never do anything to harm the U.S.\nThere is no reason to believe that he would take any action which could cause potential harm\nto his U.S. family or to this country.  He is patriotic, loves the United States, and would not permit\nRussia to exploit him.  He has close ties to the United States.  His closest family members are his\nwife and three children.  They are U.S citizens and live with him or near him.  Because his wife and\nchildren live in the United States, they are not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign\npower.  The realistic possibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress is low.  I base this\nconclusion on his credible and sincere testimony, and I do not believe he would compromise national\nsecurity, or otherwise comply with any Russian threats or coercion.  Applicant has not been to Russia\nsince 2006 and that was to settle his late father\u2019s affairs, and is unlikely to return to Russia.  His\ncompany official describe him as very honest, loyal, and trustworthy.  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances,\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated or overcome the security\nconcerns pertaining to foreign influence and foreign preference.  I have no doubts concerning\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  I take this position based on the law, as set forth in\nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person\nfactors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative\n8\nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  I conclude\nApplicant is eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n11\nSubparagraph 2.a. - 2.f.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is granted.\nRobert J. Tuider\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nFebruary 19, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, W ilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 14,\n2002 (Government Exhibit 1). On July 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines C and B of the Directive describing why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005,\nand effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n \n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 19, 2007. He answered the\nSOR in writing on August 10, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 6, 2007, and I\nreceived the case assignment on September 12, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on October 4, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 22,\n2007. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through I, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\non October 31, 2007. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nNovember 2, 2007, to submit additional matters.  On October 29, 2007, he submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit J, without objection. The record closed on October 31, 2007. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Russian Federation (Russia). (Transcript at 12-18.) The\nrequest and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence, but were\nincluded in the record as Government Exhibits 5 through 13. The facts administratively\nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 57, married, and has a Post-Graduate degree.  He is employed\nby a defense contractor as a manager and seeks a Secret level clearance in connection\nwith his employment in the defense industry.  In his Answer to the SOR, dated August\n10, 2007, the Applicant admitted factual allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i.,\nand 2.a. of the SOR, with explanations. He denied allegations 1.c., 1.f., and 1.j.  He also\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance.  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise\nof poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nThe Applicant\u2019s immediate family all live in the United States.  This includes his\nwife, daughter, parents, son by a previous marriage and two sisters.  Except for his son,\nwho is a permanent resident of the United States, all of his relatives are also American\ncitizens.  By dint of Russian law, those relatives, like the Applicant, are still viewed as\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s father fought in W orld W ar II as an officer in the Red Army.  That fact has no current security\n1\nsignificance.  (Transcript at 99-101.)\n\u201cResearch Establishment\u201d is not the real name of the organization.\n2\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel in\n3\nsupport of her request for administrative notice.  (Government Exhibits 5 through 13.)\n3\nRussian citizens as well.  None of the Applicant\u2019s direct relatives were members of the\nCommunist Party or were connected to the Soviet or Russian defense establishment.1\nThe Applicant and his family members receive no funds of any type from the Russian\ngovernment.  (Transcript at 78-82, 95-105.)  \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, brother-in-law and step-son are residents and\ncitizens of Russia.  His wife is close to her mother and brother and talks to her mother\nby telephone on an approximately weekly basis.  (Transcript at 83-90.)   She is also\nclose to her son by a prior marriage, and talks to him on a weekly basis.  (Transcript at\n90-94.)  None of these relatives are members of the Communist Party or were\nconnected to the Soviet or Russian defense establishment.\nFrom 1972 to 1994 the Applicant was employed by a Research Establishment\nconnected to the Soviet, and then Russian, Academy of Science.   During part of his\n2\ntime at the Research Establishment he held the Soviet equivalent of a Top Secret\nclearance and, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian equivalent of a Secret\nclearance.  His current employment is directly related to his work in Russia.  (Transcript\nat 76-78.) \nThe Applicant has traveled to Russia in 2003, 2004 and 2006.  During each of\nthose trips, he presented his Russian passport to Russian authorities.  Each of his trips\nto Russia have been in connection with his employment.  (Government Exhibit 3,\nTranscript at 66-69.) \nThe Applicant has contacts with Russia.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to discuss\nthe situation in Russia at this time.   I take administrative notice of the following facts.\n3\nRussia is a federation made up of 21 republics. Its government has a poor human rights\nrecord and it is plagued with corruption, media suppression, politically motivated crimes,\nand human rights violations. Russia has a significant intelligence capability that it\nretained from the Soviet Union. Russia\u2019s intelligence efforts continue to increase in\nsophistication, scope, and number. It has an aggressive industrial espionage and\nintelligence collection program targeting sensitive and protected U.S. technology.\nRussia\u2019s government sells to other countries technology with application for weapons of\nmass destruction (nuclear and biotechnology) and missiles. It has provided technology\nand support to China, Venezuela, India, and Iran against U.S. wishes. \n\n4\nParagraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has acted in a way that shows a preference for another country\nahead of the United States. \nThe Applicant was born in Russia (then the Soviet Union) in 1950.  He and his\nimmediate family emigrated to the United States in 1994 after applying for refugee\nstatus.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, D, E, F and J; Transcript at 40-58.)  The Applicant\nbegan working for his current employer in 1999.  He became a naturalized American\ncitizen in July 2001.  (Government Exhibit 1, Question 3.)  His wife was also born in\nRussia, and she also became a naturalized American citizen in July 2001.  They were\nmarried in 1983, and have one child, who is also a naturalized citizen of the United\nStates.  They have about $2 million in assets in the United States.  (Transcript at 112.)\nThe Applicant has had a Russian passport during the entire time he has been an\nAmerican citizen.  In April 2005, the Applicant renewed this passport.  (Government\nExhibit 3, and Government Exhibit 4 at page 5.)  He submits that he uses this passport\nonly to travel to Russia at the behest of his employer to attend international conferences\nconcerning his area of expertise.  (Transcript at 60-69.)  The Applicant argues that the\nRussian passport is just a visa to him, because there are stamps on there that identify\nhim as a dual citizen of Russian and the United States.  (Government Exhibit 2 at page\n3; Transcript at 73-75.)  \nThe Applicant is still a dual citizen of Russia and the United States.  The totality\nof the record shows that the Applicant is very reluctant to credibly state that he is willing\nto renounce his Russian citizenship.  The Applicant\u2019s primary reasons for not\nrenouncing his Russian citizenship appears to be that he does not want to draw the\nattention of the Russian authorities to himself, as well as those reasons stated above\nconcerning his passport.  (Government Exhibit 4 at page 3; Transcript at 70-75, 128-\n130.)\nThe Applicant stated that he has discussed the situation regarding his passport\nwith the security office of his employer.  He is knowledgeable of the requirements set\nforth in the Directive concerning how a foreign passport may be retained and used.\nAccording to him, nobody has proposed a solution in accordance with those\nrequirements.  (Transcript at 120-124.)  \n \nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted letters and other documents.  They show that the\nApplicant is a highly respected expert in his field, and that he has provided valuable\nservices to the defense efforts of the United States.  People who work with him currently\nbelieve him to be an honest man and recommend him for a security clearance.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, D, E, F, G, H, and I.)\n\n5\nPolicies\nW hen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n6\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant is a dual citizen of Russia and the United States, and that\nhe has a valid Russian passport in his possession (Guideline C); and that the Applicant\nhas family members in Russia (Guideline B)\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nThe Applicant\u2019s entire immediate family lives in the United States.  It is obvious\nthat the Applicant spent a great deal of time, trouble and money to move his immediate\nfamily here.  Except for his son, they are all American citizens.  Except for his wife, as\ndescribed below, I find that the fact they all may be viewed as Russia by dual citizens\nhas no current security significance.  Subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e. and 1.f. are\nfound for the Applicant.\nHis wife, however, has connections to Russia.  As described above, her mother,\nbrother and son still live in Russia.  His wife has many contacts with her relatives and it\ncannot be said that her relationship, as opposed to his, can be seen as being casual or\nthe contacts infrequent. \n\n7\nIn addition, there is the situation with the Applicant\u2019s long-time employment with\nthe Research Establishment.  To be sure, he made the choice to emigrate to the United\nStates, a decision which had serious consequences for his family.  The fact remains\nthat he was a senior scientist in the Research Establishment for many years.  Under\ncertain circumstances, this involvement could be mitigated.  However, combined with\nhis continuing to hold Russian citizenship and passport, as set forth below, this\nrelationship has a continuing security significance.\nAll of these connections must also be viewed in the context of the Russian\ngovernment, and in particular that government\u2019s history of attempting to obtain classified\nand other information from American companies.  To his credit, the Applicant repeatedly\nstated that he is a loyal American citizen, that he understands his responsibilities as a\nsecurity clearance holder, and that he would not be a party to any attempt by the\nRussian government to obtain information from him.  However, given the depth and\nextent of his connections with Russia, he has failed to meet his burden of showing an\nunequivocal connection to the United States. \nBased \non \nthe \nevidence \nthe \nGovernment \nhas \npresented, \nthe \nfollowing\nDisqualifying Conditions apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member .\n. . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b)\nconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information; and (d)\nsharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.  I have also considered the information concerning the Russian government,\nprovided by Department Counsel in Government Exhibits 5 through 10. \nThe Applicant has not provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background:\n7(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest; and (c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.  Paragraph 1 is found against the Applicant.\n\n8\nParagraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nTurning to Guideline C, the Applicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s\nconcerns about his dual citizenship with Russia, and his continued possession and use\nof his Russian passport after becoming an American citizen.  The concern is stated thus\nunder this Guideline, When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nUnder any analysis of the evidence, it is obvious that the Applicant would like to\nretain his Russian citizenship and passport if at all possible.  The Government well\nunderstands, and appreciates, that the Applicant does not wish to draw attention to\nhimself.  However, the Applicant did not even attempt to make a credible showing that\nhe expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship as required by Mitigating\nCondition 11.(b).  The reasons were somewhat obscure, but seem to revolve around his\nwife wanting to visit her parents.\nDisqualifying Condition 10(a)(1) applies to the facts of this case: Conditions that\ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a) exercise of any\nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport.  (Emphasis supplied.)\nOnce again, the Government understands and appreciates that the Applicant\nwould want to travel to Russia on his Russian passport in order not to draw attention to\nhimself from a security standpoint.  It is also understood that his employer would want a\nRussian speaking expert to go to symposia in Russia.  That is the reason behind the\ntwo prongs of Mitigating Conditions 11.(d) and 11.(e).  Neither the Applicant nor his\ncompany have attempted to obtain permission from the cognizant security authority for\nuse of his Russian passport, as required by Mitigating Condition 11.(d).  In addition, the\nApplicant\u2019s Russian passport has not been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.  Accordingly, Mitigating Condition 11.(e)\ndoes not apply to this case.  In light of the foregoing, Guideline C is found against the\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof \nthe \nconduct; \n(2) \nthe \ncircumstances \nsurrounding \nthe \nconduct, \nto \ninclude\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\n\n9\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Two of the factors have the most\nimpact on this case.  First, I cannot find that there is the \u201cpresence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set forth under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nThe Applicant simply has not engaged in sufficient conduct which shows a preference\nfor the United States instead of Russia.  Such conduct might include his taking the\nactions concerning his Russian passport set forth in Mitigating Conditions 11.(d) and\n(e).  In addition, he could state a credible willingness to renounce his Russian\ncitizenship at an appropriate time in the future.  \nThe lack of any of the actions stated above make it impossible for me to find that\nthere is little or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth\nin AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst  the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nW ILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 7 August 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, as amended and\n1\nmodified\u2014most recently in August 2006 (Directive).\n2\nfinancial considerations and personal conduct.  Applicant answered the SOR 16 August 2007, and\n1\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me 19 November 2007, and I convened a hearing 10\nDecember 2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 19 December 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nSix days before the scheduled hearing date, Applicant requested a continuance until February\n2008, to permit her to retain counsel to represent her, because she did not currently have the funds\nto retain counsel [Appellate Exhibit (App.E. 1)]. In a conference call on 5 December 2007, I denied\nthe request because it was not timely, not to a reasonable date certain, and was contingent on her\nhaving funds to retain counsel\u2014itself a speculative proposition (Tr. 5-9). At hearing, I left the record\nopen until the close of business on 17 December 2007, to allow Applicant to submit copies of any\nIRS documentation she claimed to have, but which she did not bring to hearing (Tr. 106-108). To\ndate, she has submitted no documentation.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the financial allegations of the SOR. She admitted failing to timely file her\nFederal income tax returns for 2000-2005, but denied falsifying her clearance application. She has\nbeen a 47-year-old instructional designer for a defense contractor since June 2006. She has not\npreviously held a clearance. She obtained her master\u2019s degree in education in May 2006.\n \nApplicant\u2019s problems with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began in 1996, when the IRS\nfiled a $9,369 tax lien against her for unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest for tax years 1991 and\n1992. She failed to file her tax returns for 1991 and 1992 because she listened to a tax protestor who\ntold her that she did not have to file her income tax returns. Applicant received periodic notices over\nthe years, which she largely ignored. In 1999, she submitted an offer in compromise to the IRS that\nthe IRS rejected. She took no further action to resolve this debt.\nApplicant does not recall whether she filed her income tax returns for 1993 through 1998,\nbut acknowledges that she did not file her income tax returns from 1999 through 2005 because she\nknew she owed taxes and did not have the money to pay them. She also acknowledges that she was\nparticularly irresponsible with her finances during this time. She filed her late tax returns in January\n2007 (G.E. 2). The income tax refunds she would have otherwise earned for those tax years were\nsufficient to satisfy the 1996 tax lien, which was released in September 2007. She filed her 2006 tax\nreturn in September 2007, within the time permitted by the extensions of time to file she obtained\nfrom the IRS.\nWhen Applicant submitted her clearance application in July 2006 (G.E. 1), she answered\n\u201cno\u201d to two questions (questions 28 a. and b.) asking if she had been 180 days delinquent on any\naccounts within the last seven years, or was currently 90 days delinquent on any account. Although\nshe had taken no steps to address her tax lien, and knew she had failed to file her income tax returns\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\nfor the last six years, she testified\u2014not credibly\u2014that she thought of the lien as dating back more\nthan seven years, and also did not think of debts to the government as debts within the scope of the\nquestions.\nIn her February 2007 answer to DOHA interrogatories (G.E. 2), Applicant listed her tax lien\nas well as three other debts to the IRS (SOR 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d.). she testified that she got those\nfigures off IRS documents in her possession, but could not remember whether those figures\nrepresented taxes due other than the tax lien or were interim balance figures on the tax lien. She did\nnot bring any IRS records to the hearing other than the lien release, and did not provide a post-\nhearing submission as she was permitted.\nApplicant\u2019s character references (A.E. B) consider her an honest and trustworthy person.\nIt does not appear that they are aware of Applicant\u2019s tax issues.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines list factors to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; (g) failure\n3\nto file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same;\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n4\nunlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n\u00b616.(a) The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel\n8\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b617.(a)  The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\n9\nbefore being confronted with the facts;\n\u00b617.(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission or concealment was caused or significantly contributed\n10\nto by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process . . . [later] the individual cooperated fully and truthfully.\n4\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. Government records reflect over $19,000 of delinquent debt\nacquired since 1996, because of her failure to file her federal income tax returns.3\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial\ndifficulties are both recent and multiple.  Her debts were not due to circumstances beyond her\n4\ncontrol, and she did not act responsibly in addressing her debts.  There is no evidence that she has\n5\nsought credit counseling or otherwise brought the problem under control.  Her tax lien from 1996\n6\nwas satisfied by the IRS seizing her income tax returns for some or all of the tax years that she was\nlate in filing. This is hardly a good-faith plan for satisfying her debts.  Applicant currently has one\n7\ntax year in which she timely filed her tax return, albeit with two extensions. This is against a\nbackdrop in which she failed to timely file her tax returns for eight of the past 14 years, and did not\nresolve an IRS tax lien for 11 years after it was filed. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. She deliberately concealed the nature and extent of her tax debts\nand issues.  Her stated explanations are a fanciful justification for her failure to disclose these issues\n8\nto the government. Further, none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. There is no\nevidence demonstrating that she corrected the falsification before being asked about it.  There is no\n9\nevidence to suggest that Applicant receive bad advice about what she was required to disclose on\nher clearance application.  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJohn Hernandez, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has had a history of financial difficulties. He has paid off or is paying the majority\nof his debts, and he has a plan to resolve any remaining overdue debt, that is not in dispute. His\nfinancial situation is stable and current. Applicant reasonably believed that the financial information\nthat he provided to the Government, on a Security Clearance Application (SCA), regarding his\nfinances,  was materially correct.  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 3, 2007 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive\n\n2\nOrder 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, dated July 14, 2007, Applicant responded in writing to the\nSOR allegations (RSOR), and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.\nThe case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on August 22, 2007. A Notice of Hearing\nwas issued to the parties on September 4, 2007, and the hearing was held on September 17, 2007.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-7) and\nno witnesses were called. Applicant appeared with counsel, submitted 11 documentary exhibits\n(Exhibits A through K) and offered his own testimony. All documentary evidence was entered into\nevidence without objection. The transcript (Tr) was received on September 24, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. The\nSOR contains seven allegations, 1.a. through 1.g., under Guideline F, and two allegations, 2.a. and\n2.b., under Guideline E. In his Response to the SOR (RSOR), Applicant admitted SOR allegations\n1.b. through 1.e. and 1.g., with explanations, and he denied allegations 1.a., 1.f., 2.a., and 2.b. The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.\n \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the live testimony and upon due consideration of\nthat evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: \nApplicant is 57 years old. He is currently engaged to be  married, and he has two daughter\nand two sons. He was born in Mexico, and English is his second language. Applicant is employed\nby a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense sector. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR lists six debts that Applicant allegedly owed as of December 27, 2006, 1.a. through\n1.g., under Adjudicative Guideline F.  The debts will be discussed in the order that they were listed\nin the SOR: \n1.a. This debt to Creditor 1 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $590, for a judgement\nentered against him. Applicant testified that this debt arose because a former landlord claimed\nApplicant  still owed him money. Applicant agreed that he went to court for this debt, but he testified\ncredibly that it was his understanding that the judge ruled that the money that the landlord had\n\n3\nretained as a security deposit would resolve any claimed debts. Applicant believed the judge\ndismissed the case, and he claimed that he never received any further documents from the court to\ninform him that he owed any additional money to the landlord. Applicant further testified that if it\nwas shown that he owed this debt, he would pay it, but he did not believe there was an overdue debt\nto this creditor.\n1.b. through 1.e.  These debts are all to Creditor 2, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax\nyears 1994, 1995, 1998, and 1999 is in the amounts of $1,592.87, 11,500.64, 272.65, and $495,\nrespectively.  Applicant testified that he always filed and paid his taxes in a timely manner but\ncontended that when he was audited by the IRS, he never received the notice, as he was a long\ndistance truck driver traveling throughout  the U.S., and he simply did not get his mail. He also\nclaimed that he did not get notice of the back taxes that he owed.  \nApplicant further testified that for the last two years, since  he became aware of the debt to\nthe IRS, he has been in contact with them, attempting to resolve this debt. He stated that his overdue\ndebt to the IRS had totaled $30,000, but it  has now been reduced to $11,500, through the IRS lien\nand by his filing amended taxes for tax years 2004 and 2006 (Exhibits A and B) . Applicant also\nrecently filed an amended tax return for year 2005, and he anticipates an additional $2,400 being\napplied to the debt (Exhibit C). \nFinally, Applicant has entered into an agreement with the IRS, in which he would make\npayments of $226 a month to the IRS. Thus far he has made two payments of $226. \n1.f. This debt to Creditor 3 is in the amount of $1,684. Applicant testified that this debt was\nincurred as a result of a dental treatment that he received from a work related injury. He was\ninformed, and it is still his belief, that this debt should have been resolved through workers\ncompensation insurance. He is attempting, with the help of his attorney, to have this debt resolved\nas  a workers compensation debt.\n1.g. This debt to Creditor 4 is listed in the SOR in the amounts of $221. At the hearing,\nApplicant testified that this debt arose because he cosigned the contract for his daughter\u2019s phone. He\nhas been attempting to resolve the debt, but when he contacted the collection agency which had been\nattempting to collect on this debt, he was informed that they no longer were responsible for this debt.\nHowever, he was not told who is now attempting to collect this debt. He testified that when he could\nascertain who owned this debt, he would make prompt restitution. \nSince Applicant  incurred these debts, he has been and remains current on all his other debts,\nand he has demonstrated a stable and mature outlook about his finances.\nApplicant also submitted 4 letters of reference from individuals, who know him. All of them\nspoke extremely highly of him as honest, hard working and dependable (Exhibit K). \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges that when Applicant completed an SCA,  executed on October 7,\n2005,  (Exhibit 1), he did not furnish truthful, complete answers. \n\n4\n2.a. Question #27 c.  asks,  \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your\nproperty for failing to pay taxes or other debts?\u201d Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to this question. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have included all of the debts, listed on the SOR as 1.b.\nthrough 1.e., above, as they were all debts for which  the IRS did place a lien on Applicant\u2019s wages.\nApplicant testified credibly that he believed the question only concerned real property, and\nsince he did not own any property, he believed that  he answered the question correctly. As discussed\nabove, English is the second language of this Applicant, and I am persuaded that his incorrect\nresponse to this question was as a result of a misunderstanding, not an attempt to mislead the\nGovernment.\n2.b. Question #27 d. asks,  \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any judgements against you that\nhave not been paid?\u201d Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to this question. The Government alleges that\nApplicant should have included the judgement,  listed on the SOR as 1.a. \nAs discussed in subparagraph 1.a., above, Applicant believed this debt was resolved and no\njudgement was placed against him. The evidence has not clearly established that a judgement was\nentered against Applicant , but it any case, I find that Applicant had a good faith belief that there was\nno judgement, so his response to this question was not an attempt to mislead the Government.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully\nconsidered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense\ndetermination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or\nmitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.\nAlthough the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not\ndeterminative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of\nseriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of\nknowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). \nBURDEN OF PROOF\n\n5\n            Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish\nhis security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\ndemonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's\nfitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration\nof such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of\nrecurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has\na heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted\nby the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988),\n\"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance. This the\nApplicant has done.\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines F and  E: \n(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government has established its initial case under Guideline F. The record evidence\nproves Applicant's history of indebtedness, primarily to the IRS. However, there is evidence that\nApplicant is attempting to resolve the overdue debts to the IRS.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F in the Adjudicative\nGuidelines, I conclude DC 19 (a) applies because of Appellant\u2019s \u201chistory of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nIn considering the Mitigating Conditions (MC) I find that MC 20. (d)  applies, as Applicant\nhas initiated a good-faith effort to repay the IRS, and (e) also applies, as Applicant has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the debt listed as 1.a., because he believes the court resolved the case in his favor,\n\n6\nand 1.f., because Applicant believes this debt should have been resolved through workers\ncompensation insurance.   I, therefore, hold Guideline F for Applicant. \n(Guideline E -Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided incorrect\nmaterial information to the Government in response to at least one of the two questions on the SCA\nthat he executed in 2005. Applicant did have a lien placed on his property by the IRS. As discussed\nabove, it is not clear if a judgement was entered against him. However, I find that Applicant\u2019s\ncontention that he did not believe a judgement was entered against him, and he understood the term\nproperty to mean only real property when he completed his SCA are valid, and Applicant did not\nintend to mislead the Government.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC applies against Applicant.\nI therefore, resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the  Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations,  Guideline F: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: For Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct,  Guideline E: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.: For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances and facts presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\n\n7\nMartin H.

As required by Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R (Jan.\n1987), as amended (Regulation), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan. 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 30, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July\n12, 2007, and elected to her case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernments\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on August 9, 2007. The FORM was mailed to\nApplicant on August 15, 2007, and it was received on August 20, 2007. Applicant was afforded an\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant\ndid not submit additional material. The case was assigned to me on October 5, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 25-year-old mother of four children. She lists in her Public Trust Position\nApplication dated January 27, 2006, that she has never been married.  In answers to interrogatories\n1\nshe stated she is looking for an attorney \u201cdue to a culturly\u201d (sic) divorce.  It is unclear what this\n2\nmeans. Applicant has worked for a federal contractor since January 2006, although she was on a\nleave of absence, for an unknown period of time, when she gave birth to her last child sometime in\n2007.\nApplicant admitted she owes more than $29,500 in delinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-\n1.o. She denies she owes the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but offered no explanation as to any action she\nhas taken to resolve it with the creditor.  Applicant also admitted she has not made any payments\n3\nsince September 2004 on any of the delinquent debts. The delinquent debts are for telephone\nservices, credit cards, clothing stores, a repossessed automobile, and student loans. \nApplicant admitted she lives paycheck to paycheck and pays her monthly living expenses,\nbut does not earn enough money. She provided no information as to whether she receives child\nsupport for her children. She stated she planned on \u201cfixing\u201d her debts but it will take some time\nbecause she has a newborn. She stated she was looking into counseling to help her with her credit.\nShe offered no other information as to whether she actually attended credit counseling.  She also\n4\nstated she is looking into bankruptcy.  Applicant provided this information on February 26, 2007.\n5\nShe did not provide any additional information since then to substantiate that she has taken any of\n\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n6\nRegulation \u00b6 C2.1.2.\n7\nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n8\nRegulation \u00b6 C3.1.2.2.\n9\nRegulation \u00b6C6.1.1.1.\n10\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n11\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines 2(a).\n12\n3\nthese actions. She did not provide any other information to show she is paying or resolving any of\nher delinquent debts.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised adjudicative guidelines are used to make ADP trustworthiness determinations.\nDepartment of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the\nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.6\nAn individual may not be assigned to perform sensitive duties unless a competent security\nauthority determines it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to do so.  Positions\n7\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  ADP III positions are\n8\n\u201cnonsensitive positions.\u201d  However, DOHA has been directed to apply the due process provisions\n9\nof the Directive for all trustworthiness determinations under ADP I, II, and including ADP III\npositions by a memorandum from the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and\nSecurity) dated November 19, 2004. Thus, even though ADP III positions are nonsensitive, they are\ntreated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP I and II\ncases. \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for \u2026assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \u2026assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  The\n10\nrevised adjudicative guidelines set for potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the\nadjudicative procedures contained in the Directive.11\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  Each eligibility\n12\ndetermination  must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically these are: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of\nparticipation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n13\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n14\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n15\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

Although the presence or absence of a particular condition\nor factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n13\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n14\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n15\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n16\ndecision.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\n17\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n18\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n19\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n20\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n21\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n\n5\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nFinancial Considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.\nBased on all of the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and FC DC 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration, and/or other\nfinancial analysis) apply in this case. Applicant has more than $29,500 in debts that are delinquent.\nShe has not made any payments since at least September 2004 and presently does not have the means\nto pay them. She did not provide any evidence that she has taken any action to resolve them. The\namount owed on certain credit cards, at least one which could be considered a luxury store, raises\nconcerns that she is spending beyond her means. \nI have considered all of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Applicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unpaid and\nunresolved. She is a mother of four, but provided no information as to how she became so deeply in\ndebt, if the cause was beyond her control, whether she receives any support for her children, and why\nshe has not taken any action to resolve them since 2004. She stated she was looking into credit\ncounseling and bankruptcy, but did not substantiate any action in this regard. She was also looking\ninto some type of divorce, but again no information was provided regarding how this impacted her\nfinances. Applicant is deeply in debt and admitted she does not earn enough money to repay the debt,\nbut does plan on \u201cfixing\u201d the problem. After careful consideration of all of the mitigating conditions\nI find none apply. Applicant has not offered any evidence to show she is doing anything to resolve\nher financial problems. \nThe Whole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\n\n6\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating  Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness. Applicant is a young mother with four children and is having\ndifficulty with her finances. She provided very little information to show the cause of her problems,\nwhether the problems were beyond her control, or that she has taken any substantive action to resolve\nher financial problems. I find Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised by the\nfinancial considerations concerns. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this\ncase, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a trustworthiness\ndetermination. Accordingly Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not  clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position. Eligibility\nis denied.\nCarol G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, the testimony and the exhibits. The Applicant is 51 years old and has a high school diploma. She is employed by a defense contractor as a Benefits Service Representative and is seeking to obtain a determination of trustworthiness in connection with her employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a determination of trustworthiness, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a determination of trustworthiness because she is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits each of the delinquent debts set forth in allegations, 1(a) through 1(i) of the SOR. (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR). 3 Credit reports of the Applicant indicate that she is indebted to eight separate creditors, totaling an approximate amount of $11,800.00. (See Government Exhibits 2, 3, 5, and 6). During her marriage, the Applicant and her husband often spent money that they did not have. In June 1996, they filed Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and discharged their debts in October 1996. (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 4). ",

Howry, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nCircumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control caused most of her financial indebtedness.\nNamely, a bad marriage followed by a separation and divorce, a job lay off, and a cancer diagnosis\nfollowed by surgery and radiation treatment.  Since then she has consolidated her debts and is paying\nthem off on a regular monthly basis.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, she has made\na good faith effort to resolve these debts.  A determination of trustworthiness and access to sensitive\npersonal information is granted.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nCommand, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD C3I) entered into a memorandum of\nagreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed\nin Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulations 5200.2R, Personnel Security\nProgram (Regulation), dated January of 1987.\nOn May 24, 2007, DOHA, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\ndetermination of trustworthiness, suitability, and eligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive\nSystems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 19, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on August 22,\n2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on August 30, 2007, scheduling the hearing for September 25,\n2007.  Applicant requested a continuance in the matter, but good cause had not been shown and the\ncontinuance was denied.  At the hearing the Government presented eight exhibits.  The Applicant\npresented six exhibits and testified on her own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on\nOctober 3, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 51 years old and has a high school diploma.  She is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Benefits Service Representative and is seeking to obtain a\ndetermination of trustworthiness in connection with her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a determination of trustworthiness, on\nthe basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the Applicant\nis ineligible for a determination of trustworthiness because she is financially overextended and at risk\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the delinquent debts set forth in allegations, 1(a) through 1(i)\nof the SOR.  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR).  \n\n3\nCredit reports of the Applicant indicate that she is indebted to eight separate creditors,\ntotaling an approximate amount of $11,800.00.  (See Government Exhibits 2, 3, 5, and 6).   \nDuring her marriage, the Applicant and her husband often spent money that they did not\nhave.  In June 1996, they filed Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and discharged their debts in October 1996.\n(See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 4).  Problems in the marriage concerning their finances continued and the\nApplicant and her husband separated in December 1997.  \nFrom 2002 to 2004, the Applicant worked two jobs to support herself and her children.\nDuring this period, all of her bills were paid on time and her credit rating was good.  She received\nno financial assistance from her husband whatsoever.  However, due to health reasons, namely high\nblood pressure, stress and irritable bowel syndrome she was forced to quit one of her jobs in 2004.\nThen in April 2005, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and was laid off from her other job.  She\nunderwent surgery and in January 2006, started radiation treatments.  Her unemployment benefits\nran out, and she was unable to find work that she was able to do.  Since she had no income to support\nherself or her children, the Breast Cancer Survivors Association assisted her with some of her bills,\nher rent, utilities, car payment and car insurance for the months of January, February and March\n2006.  Her other bills simply became seriously delinquent, and these are the debts that are listed in\nthe SOR.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).  \nSeveral unexpected events occurred that further aggravated her financial situation.  She was\nthe victim of check fraud, in the amount of $2,500.00.  Her son with whom she had cosigned for a\ntruck stopped making payments on it and left her responsible for it.  The job she eventually got paid\nsubstantially less than what she had earned before, so her earnings were still not enough to meet her\nexpenditures.  \nThe Applicant filed for divorce in January 2006, and it became final in September 2006.  She\nstarted working for her current employer in February 2006.  In May 2007, the Applicant applied for\nand obtained a loan in the amount of $2,500.00 to assist in paying off some of her debts.  At the time,\nshe thought that she could afford to pay for it.  She later determined that with everything else she was\nresponsible for, the payments were just too much for her to handle. \nIn June 2007, she first sought out professional help to assist in resolving her delinquent debts.\nThe financial counselor that she hired lost her paperwork in July 2007, and the matter was delayed\nby no fault of the Applicants.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  In September 2007, the Applicant was\nactually able to enter into a debt consolidation program that includes each of the debts listed in the\nSOR.  The debt consolidation program will take 38 months to pay off all her debts and requires her\nto pay $224.00 per month that is automatically deducted out of her banking account.  She started the\nprogram in September 2007.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \nThe Applicant has accumulated no new debt since her job layoff.  She is current with all of\nher regular monthly expenses.  She has moved into an affordable apartment and is living well within\nher means.  She plans to continue with the debt payment program until all of her debts are paid off\nin full.\n\n4\nThe Applicant\u2019s performance appraisal for the period from April 1, 2006 through March 31,\n2007, reflects that she either \u201cmeets day to day expectations\u201d or \u201cconsistently meets and often\nexceeds day to day expectations\u201d in every category.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D). \nE-mail correspondence from coworkers and/or supervisors attest to the fact that the Applicant\nis a good trainer and is patient, flexible and willing to help others.  She is well respected and greatly\nappreciated for her efforts on the job.  She is highly recommended for a position of trust. (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are\nfound to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead\nto financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n19.  Conditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)\n inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)\n a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual has acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\n\n5\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n6\nIn the defense industry, a determination of trustworthiness and access to sensitive personal\ninformation is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive\ninformation twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for such access may\nbe involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the holding of a\ndetermination of trustworthiness.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the\nApplicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to\novercome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of\npersuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a\ndetermination of trustworthiness.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been\nfinancially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with her determination of trustworthiness\neligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  Conditions largely\nbeyond the Applicant\u2019s control caused her financial delinquencies.  Namely, a bad marriage followed\nby a separation and divorce, a job lay off, and a cancer diagnosis followed by surgery and radiation\ntreatment.  Since then, the Applicant has completed her medical treatment, obtained employment,\nand financial counseling and she is paying her delinquent debts.  What more can we ask under the\ncircumstances.  She has entered into a debt consolidation program and is making regular monthly\npayments toward her debts.  She will be completely debt free in 38 months.  Under the particular\nfacts of this case, she has made a good faith effort to resolve her debts.   Her financial indebtedness\nis not recurring and she has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of financial\nresponsibility.\n  \nThere is sufficient evidence of financial rehabilitation.  Under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c)\na history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20(b) the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual has acted responsibly under the circumstances, 20(c) the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control, and 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.\n\n7\nClearly, her financial problems were isolated to the periods when she was married, ill and/or\nunemployed.  She is now divorced, healthy and gainfully employed.  Her finances are in proper\norder.  Her financial problems are not recurring, and the Applicant has initiated a prompt, good faith\neffort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing\nher request for a trustworthiness determination.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the\nApplicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                           \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nto grant or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability, and eligibility for the Applicant\nto hold a sensitive Systems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\n\n8\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision under Guideline\nE is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings: Applicant is a 34-year old senior security\nclearance adjudicator employed by a defense contractor since October 2005.  She seeks to retain the\nsecurity clearance she has held since September 1997.\nApplicant first went to work for Company 1 in October 2002, when she was employed as a\ncontract adjudicator on-site at a federal government agency.  Company 1 lost the contract to\nCompany 2 in May 2005; but because Company 1 did not have a contract on which to employ her,\nshe continued to work at the same site for Company 2.  In so doing, she signed a standard non-\ndisclosure agreement, stating that she would not disclose any information about Company 2 or its\nemployees outside the company without the company\u2019s permission.  She asserted that she never read\nthe document and signed it hurriedly to keep her job.  However, she knew from earlier employments\nthat she was prohibited from disclosing information about the company or its employees without\npermission.  In September 2005, Applicant received an offer of employment from Company 1, which\nshe indicated she would accept.  Company 1 also indicated it was looking for other employees, and\nwas willing to consider any of her coworkers who were interested.  Applicant passed the information\nto her coworkers, collected resumes they offered to her, and attempted to transmit them by facsimile\nto Company 1\u2014using the government agency facsimile machine and agency cover sheet.  By error,\nshe did not transmit the resumes and other supporting documents to Company 1, but to her then\nemployer, Company 2.  Company 2 fired her the same day for violating her written non-disclosure\nagreement.  \nIn October 2005, Applicant resumed employment with Company 1.  Her current supervisor\nconsiders her an excellent employee, but acknowledged that a non-disclosure agreement such as\nApplicant signed with her previous employer is fairly standard in the industry, and Applicant\u2019s\ncompany also uses a similar agreement.  He stated that providing employee information, such as\nresumes, to a third party without authorization is potential grounds for termination.  At the hearing,\nas in her answer to the SOR, Applicant insists that she did nothing wrong.  However, she\nacknowledged that it was not in her then-employer\u2019s financial interest for her to transmit her co-\nworkers\u2019 resumes to a competitor, and it was not part of her job description.\n  \n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because\nthe Judge erred in finding that Applicant \u201cinsistsedthat she did nothing wrong\u201d and that \u201cshe does\nnot really understand why what she did was wrong or why her employer was so upset that it fired her\non the spot.\u201d  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s argument persuasive.\n\n3\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge erred, as a matter of law, because (a) he did not\narticulate a nexus between Applicant\u2019s conduct and the security concerns set forth under Guideline\nE, and (b) he did not favorably apply any mitigating conditions or whole-person factors. Applicant\u2019s\nargument does not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under\nany of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-22325 at\n3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2004).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually\nmishandles or fails to properly handle or safeguard classified information before it can deny or\nrevoke access to such information.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969),\ncert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  The absence of security violations does not bar or preclude an\nadverse security clearance decision. See ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005).\n \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the recency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct.  Decision at 3-4.  He\nreasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was\ninsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  Id. at 4.  The Board does not review\na case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172\nat 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\n\n4\nexplanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice\nmade.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S.\n29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nPro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 9 August 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nE.  Applicant answered the SOR 4 September 2007, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 6 December 2007, and I convened a hearing 11 January\n2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 22 January 2008.\n \nMarch 31, 2008\n\nHer original employer had a copy of her resume, and she was considered subject to recall because of the\n2\ncircumstances of her earlier termination.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant denied the SOR allegations. She is a 34-year-old senior security\nclearance adjudicator employed by a defense contractor since October 2005. She\nseeks to retain the security clearance she has held since September 1997.\nApplicant first went to work for her current employer in October 2002, when she\nwas employed as a contract adjudicator on-site at a federal government agency. Her\nemployer lost the contract to another company in May 2005, but because the employer\ndid not have a contract on which to employ her, she remained with the new holder of the\ncontract. In so doing, she signed a standard non-disclosure agreement, stating that she\nwould not disclose any information about the company or its employees outside the\ncompany without the company\u2019s permission. She claims that she signed the document\nhurriedly to keep her job and never read it. However, she knew from earlier\nemployments that she was prohibited from disclosing information about the company or\nits employees without permission (Tr. 28).\nIn September 2005, she was contacted by her old employer with an offer of\nemployment,  which she indicated she would accept. Her old employer also indicated it\n2\nwas looking for other employees, and was willing to consider any of her coworkers who\nwere interested. Applicant passed the information to her coworkers, collected resumes\nthey offered to her, and attempted to transmit them by facsimile to her old\nemployer\u2014using the government agency facsimile machine and agency cover sheet.\nUnfortunately, she did not transmit the resumes and other supporting documents to her\nold employer, but to her current one. That company fired her the same day for violating\nher written non-disclosure agreement (G.E. 3). In October 2005, she resumed\nemployment with her old company.\nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor considers her an excellent employee, but\nacknowledges that a non-disclosure agreement such as Applicant signed with her\nprevious employer is fairly standard in the industry, and Applicant\u2019s company also uses\na similar agreement. He stated that providing employee information, such as resumes,\nto a third party without authorization is potential grounds for termination.\nAt hearing, as in her answer to the SOR, Applicant insists that she did nothing\nwrong. However, she acknowledged that it was not in her then-employer\u2019s financial\ninterest for her to transmit her co-workers\u2019 resumes to a competitor. Nor was it part of\nher job description.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b616.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not\n4\nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available\ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not\nlimited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information;. . . (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\n3\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. She used government resources to\nattempt to transmit employee information that her current employer considered sensitive\nor proprietary to a competitor\u2014one who had previously held the same contract.  She\n4\n\nemployer\u2019s time or resources; (f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to\nthe employer as a condition of employment; \n4\ndid so the same day that she had been offered, and accepted, re-employment with that\ncompetitor. Without doubt, Applicant was within her rights to discuss employment with\nher old employer, even to provide her resume. She was even within her rights to inform\nher co-workers that her old employer was hiring. They, in turn, could properly submit\ntheir resumes to the company. Where Applicant ran afoul of her fiduciary duty to her\nemployer was undertaking to accept and transmit her co-workers\u2019 resumes to the\ncompetitor. This is true whether she obtained the resumes directly from her co-workers\nor from company files. More tellingly, even today she does not really understand why\nwhat she did was wrong or why her employer was so upset that it fired her on the spot.\nBecause of this, I conclude that none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The\ncircumstances of this conduct were not unusual\u2014contractors are replaced by successor\ncontractors who routinely retain some of the employees working for the old company.\nFurther, Applicant\u2019s inability to recognize how she breached her fiduciary duty to her\nemployer supports my whole-person assessment that she should not have access to\nclassified information. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

CEFOLA\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRobert E. Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant is a dual national with Turkey.  She also maintains a current Turkish passport,\nwhich she used to enter and exit Turkey during her last two visits in 2005 and 2006.  The Applicant\nintends to retain her dual nationality and Turkish passport, as she will inherit her family\u2019s property\nin Turkey.  Her mother and step-father are citizens and residents of Turkey.  They are both retired,\nbut apparently have a substantial property interest in Turkey, which will be passed on to the\nApplicant, their only child.  Mitigation is not shown.  Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about June 26, 2007.\nApplicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 9,\n2007.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or\nmitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received her copy on September 25,\n2007, and submitted nothing in reply.  The case was received by the undersigned for resolution on\nDecember 13, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's alleged Foreign Preference\nand Foreign Influence militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits\nthe underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File of\nRelevant Material.  The Applicant is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\n1.a.~1.d.  The Applicant is a dual national with Turkey (Item 4 at page 3).  She became a U.S.\ncitizen in July of 2005, but retains a current Turkish passport which does not expire until May of\n2011 (Id, and Item 5 at page 2).  In August of 2005 and again in August of 2006, the Applicant used\nher \u201cTurkish passport instead of . . . [her] United States passport to enter Turkey in order to avoid\nthe visa charge and [for] ease of moment through customs\u201d (Item 3 at page 1).  The Applicant is not\nwilling to destroy, surrender or invalidate her Turkish passport (Id).  She \u201cmust maintain [her]\nTurkish citizenship in order to inherit land currently owned by [her] mother\u201d (Item 3 at page 20).\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n2.a. and 2.b.  The Appellant traveled to Turkey in 1998, 2000, 2003, 2005 and 2006 to visit\nher parents (Item 3 at page 2, and Item 4 at pages 21~23).  Her mother and step-father are both\nretired (Item 6 at page 3).  Her step-father served in the Turkish Army during the Korean War (Item\n3).\n\n3\nTurkey lies between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea and strategically links Europe\nand the Middle East.  The roots of the modern state of Turkey go back to the Islamic Turkish\nOttoman Empire.  Turkey has been officially secular since 1924, although 99% of the population is\nMuslim.  In terms of human rights, the Turkish government continues to face major challenges of\nincreasing the legal accountability of government security forces.  The abuses of the security forces\ninclude killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests.  In foreign relations, Turkey\u2019s political, economic, and\nsecurity ties are with the West and it is negotiating to seek admission into the European Union.\nTurkey is also a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  Turkey cooperates closely with\nthe U.S. on a number of security issues (Items 7~11).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\n\n4\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who has demonstrated a Foreign Preference or who is subject to Foreign\nInfluence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a\nsecurity clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant is a dual national with Turkey, and maintains and uses a current Turkish\npassport.  She maintains her Turkish citizenship and passport, as the Applicant fully expects to\ninherit property in Turkey.  The first disqualifying condition under Foreign Preference is therefore\napplicable as there was an \"exercise of any right . . . of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen . . . .  This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; . . . (5)\nusing foreign citizenship to protect financial . . . interests in another country . . .\"  There are no\ncountervailing mitigating conditions.\nThe Applicant's parents are citizens of and reside in Turkey.  The first and second\ndisqualifying conditions under Foreign Influence are therefore applicable as this contact \u201ccreates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\" and\ncreates \u201ca potential conflict of interests between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that\ninformation.\u201d  The fifth disqualifying condition is also applicable, as there apparently is \u201ca\nsubstantial . . . financial or property interest in a foreign country . . . which could subject the\nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  Again, I can find no\ncountervailing mitigating conditions here.  The Applicant\u2019s parents will pass on a substantial\nfinancial and/or property interest to the Applicant, an interest she is relying on to the extent of\nmaintaining her Turkish citizenship.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding\nher  perceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence.  The Applicant has thus not met the\nmitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly,\nshe has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines B and C.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Foreign Preference AGAINST THE APPLICANT\na.   Against the Applicant.\nb.   Against the Applicant.\n\n5\nc.   Against the Applicant.\nd.   Against the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Foreign Influence\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\na.   Against the Applicant.\nb.   Against the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

On April 18, 2007, the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nsecurity concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline H (Drug\nInvolvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) regarding Applicant. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992),\nas amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 3, 2007. He answered the\nSOR allegations in writing with brief narrative comments through a letter dated May 3,\n2007. In that letter, he admitted all allegations contained in the SOR and requested a\ndetermination based on the written record. \n\n Item 7 (Report, \u00a7 g, dated October 14, 2005).\n1\n2\nIn response to Applicant\u2019s answer, Department Counsel prepared a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM), dated September 7, 2007.

Consequently, the facts\nof record are scant. Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He\nhas been a senior technician for the same company since 1997. From 1986 through\n1988, he served in the U.S. Army as a Specialist 4/Corporal [E-4], then served in the\nArmy National Guard from 1988 through May 1991.

He did so\nto feel a \u201cslight buzz of drunkenness.\u201d  \n1\nIn 1991 or 1992, at approximately 23 or 24 years of age, Applicant worked for a\ncomputer-related business. He stole a computer valued at approximately $600. He\nnever returned the computer to his employer. \nOn April 1, 1992, at the age of 24, he joined some friends for drinks after work on\na work night. He had five or six vodka martinis within two to three hours. He was later\narrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). Applicant considered the\nincident to be atypical of his usual drinking habits and tastes. He continued drinking\nbeer on weekends at parties and at bars.\nIn 1992 through about 1993, Applicant worked in a restaurant. He had a\nromance with the district manager. She introduced him to marijuana. He used\nmarijuana about four or five times during that time period, but never purchased it. \nApplicant acquired his current work position in 1997. He eventually applied for a\nsecurity clearance. In approximately October 1998, he was granted a security\nclearance.\n\n Id.\n2\n The FORM only includes a copy of Applicant\u2019s May 2005 and November 2004 SF-86 forms. Both reflect\n3\nnegative answers to Questions 27 and 28. The FORM does not include a copy of the referenced October 14,\n2005, SF-86. Since the Applicant admitted to SOR allegations 3(a) and 3(b) concerning negative answers to\nthose questions on the October 2005 SF-86 without objection,  I will consider his admission as evidence of\nthe fact asserted in the applicable allegations.\n See Id. at \u00a7 h.\n4\n Item 4 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR).\n5\n3\nOn a few occasions in 1999 and 2000, Applicant again used marijuana. In the\ninterim, on December 1, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with a second DWI.\nHe became concerned about his alcohol use. He ceased drinking alcohol from\nDecember 1999 through about August 2000 and attended a counseling center\u2019s out-\npatient alcohol treatment program. Abstinence was not difficult for Applicant and he had\nno withdrawal symptoms. He was comfortable serving as a designated driver at parties.\nHe reintroduced alcohol into his lifestyle in the summer of 2000. Applicant has not had\na problem with alcohol since the December 1999 incident. He considers his present\ndrinking patterns to consist of socially consuming beer with friends on weekends. He\ndoes not drink with the express purpose of getting intoxicated, and opines that he only\ngets to the point of intoxication about three to four times per year.  \n2\nOn November 30, 2004, Applicant completed an SF-86. On that form, he\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 27: You Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity \u2013 Illegal\nUse of Drugs \u2013 Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, which ever is shorter, have\nyou illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack\ncocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.) , hallucinogenics\n(LSD, PCP, etc.) or prescription drugs? He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 28: Your\nUse of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity \u2013 Use in Sensitive Positions \u2013 Have you\never used a controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer,\nprosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or while in a\nposition directly or immediately affecting public safety. Applicant again answered \u201cNo\u201d to\nthese two questions on SF-86 forms completed and signed on May 18, 2005, and\nOctober 14, 2005.  \n3\nOn May 29 or May 30, 2005, over Memorial Day weekend,  Applicant was at a\n4\nsocial gathering and had more than his limit to drink. He succumbed to using marijuana\nwith an acquaintance. He has since refrained from the use of illegal drugs. Despite this\nusage, Applicant again answered \u201cNo\u201d to Questions 27 and 28 regarding illegal drugs\nand drug activity on an SF-86 form completed on October 14, 2005.\nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s drug use, it has been sporadic, infrequent, and he has\nexpressed his intent to not again use illegal drugs in the future.  He denied past drug\n5\nuse on his SF-86s on the advice of co-workers. He has since regretted not being\ntruthful about these past incidents, but was not sure how to reconcile the facts without\n\n See Item 7 (Review Documents, October 14, 2005, Report).\n6\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n7\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n9\n4\nrisk to his well-being. He voluntarily came forward with facts about his past drug use\nwhen he applied for a higher clearance, thinking this would be an opportune time to\ncome clean. He disclosed these facts in an October 14, 2005, interview.  He is relieved\n6\nthat he has since done so. With regard to alcohol consumption, he has not had any\nother alcohol-related incidents since his 1999 DWI. Applicant stresses that these issues\ndo not reflect the more mature man he is today.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n7\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n9\n \n\n Id.\n10\n Id.\n11\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n12\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n11\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n12\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption. The Concern: Excessive\nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement. The Concern: Use of an illegal drug\nor misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because\nit raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations. \u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior altering\nsubstances, and include drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds\nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g.,\nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens)\nand inhalants and other substances. \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or\nuse of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n\n6\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct. The Concern: Conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is\nany failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate\nsecurity concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nIssues regarding one\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness can arise from unbridled\nalcohol consumption because it can lead to uncontrolled impulses and questionable\njudgment. Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI in 1991 and in 1999 during his\npersonal time off work. Therefore, Alcohol Consumption (AC) Disqualifying Condition\n(DC) 1, AG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while\nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent) applies. With a disqualifying condition thus established,\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate related security concerns.\nApplicant started consuming alcohol as a teen. He is now nearly 40-years-old.\nHe has experienced two alcohol-related incidents in the intervening years. His first DWI\noccurred when he was in his early 20s, nearly 16 years ago. His second DWI occurred\nnearly a decade ago. He completed a lengthy out-patient treatment program. There is\nno evidence any professional ever determined that he was alcohol dependent. Although\nhe still continues to consume alcohol, there is no evidence of a subsequent alcohol-\nrelated incident in the past decade. Consequently, AC Mitigating Condition (MC) 1, AG\n\u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. \nAfter the 1999 DWI, Applicant became concerned about his alcohol use. He\nunderwent approximately eight months of out-patient treatment without difficulty. There\nis no indication in the record he was determined to be alcohol dependent, although\nfacts indicate he abused alcohol then drove an automobile in 1991 and 1999. He quit\ndrinking alcohol for nine months without difficulty. He resumed moderate use of alcohol\nin September 2000. He now comports his behavior appropriately when imbibing, and\nhas not had another alcohol-related incident. Although additional testimony would help\nclarify what other, if any, precautions Applicant has taken to preclude future alcohol-\nrelated incidents from again happening, AC MC 2, AG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual\nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a patter of abstinence (if\n\n7\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser) applies. None of the other\nAC MCs apply.\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug such as marijuana can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Marijuana may impair judgment and its use\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with the law. Here,\nApplicant used marijuana on a few occasions in 1992\u20131993. In October 1998, he was\ngranted a security clearance, but again used marijuana on a few occasions in 1999-\n2000, and on one isolated occasion in late May 2005. Consequently, both Drug\nInvolvement (DI) DC 1, AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse) and DI DC 7, AG \u00b6 25(g) (any\nillegal drug use after being granted a security clearance) apply. With disqualifying\nconditions thus established, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate related security\nconcerns.\nApplicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs was limited to the occasional use of marijuana, an\nillegal substance. From 1992 through 1993, Applicant, then in his early 20's, partook of\nthe narcotic on a few occasions because his girlfriend used the drug. He then abstained\nuntil he again used it on a few occasions in 1999 through 2000. He used it one more\ntime in May 2005. Applicant candidly divulged his past drug use in order to set his\nrecord straight and has since affirmatively stated his intent to never again use drugs.\nGiven the sporadic and infrequent nature of his past use, this should not be a difficult\nresolution to keep. Although his singular use of marijuana in 2005 brings his drug use\ninto the new millennium, the fact that the majority of his use occurred a number of years\nago and the fact that he has resolved not to use marijuana again, give rise to DI MC 1,\nAG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. None of the other DI MCs,\nhowever, apply.\nApplicant\u2019s past drug use is a matter of fact. He candidly and voluntarily came\nforward about his previously concealed past on his own initiative. He has corrected the\nrecord, and taken responsibility for his past actions. Moreover, Applicant has expressed\nhis resolve to never again use illegal drugs. Given his sporadic and nominal past use,\nthe majority of which was in the distant past, there is no reason to believe he will\nrelapse or that such incidents will recur. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Here,\nApplicant failed to disclose his past use of marijuana in his 2004 and 2005 SF-86s. He\nsimilarly sought to conceal his past use of marijuana while possessing a security\nclearance. Consequently, Personal Conduct (PC) DC 1, AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\n\n This is especially true given the guideline\u2019s statement \u2013 \u201c[o]f special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n13\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \n8\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities) applies.  With PC DC 1 thus raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to\n13\nmitigate the related security concerns.\nAlthough Applicant ultimately disclosed the truth regarding the theft of office\nequipment from a former employer and drug use that dates back to the early 1990s, he\ndid not do so until sometime between May 2005 and October 14, 2005, the date of his\nlast SF-86. Although the October 14, 2005, SF-86 is not part of the official FORM,\nApplicant admitted he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the illegal drug use questions on that SF-86.\nOn that same day, however, he voluntarily disclosed his past drug use to an\ninvestigator.  While he made prompt efforts to correct matters with regard to the\nOctober 2005 questionnaire, such promptness does not extend to those prior SF-86\nquestionnaires completed between 1998 and May 2005, when he denied past illegal\ndrug use while maintaining a security clearance. Therefore, PC MC 1, AG \u00b6 17 (the\nindividual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts) cannot apply.\nApplicant partly attributes his concealment of facts on his SF-86 questionnaires\nto the advice of colleagues. Without more information, the exact role and rank of these\nworkplace peers cannot be discerned. Consequently, PC MC 2, AG \u00b6 17(b) (the refusal\nor failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal\ncounsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security\nclearance process. Upon being aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the\ninformation, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully) cannot apply. Furthermore,\ndrug involvement is a significant consideration in the granting of a security clearance\ninasmuch as drug use affects sound judgment and demonstrates questionable concern\nregarding the law. Although Applicant last used marijuana almost three years ago, in\nMay 2005, he did so almost immediately after certifying he had not used drugs in the\npast seven years and had not used drugs while maintaining a security clearance.\nConsequently, doubt lingers as to his good judgment and trustworthiness. Under these\nfacts, the sum of the considerations under PC MC 3, AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.\nFinally, it cannot be ignored that Applicant took it upon himself to come clean\nand disclose the truth of his past illegal drug use. Therefore, PC MC 5, AG \u00b6 17(e) (the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress) applies. \n\n9\nAlthough Applicant is to be applauded for voluntarily disclosing the truth about\nhis drug use from the early 1990s through May 2005, it cannot be ignored that he\ncontinued to use drugs after he was granted a security clearance in 1998. Nor can it be\nignored that he repeatedly denied drug use on SF-86 questionnaires multiple times in\nthe year preceding his 2005 disclosure. Although nearly three years have passed since\nhe last used drugs and although nearly two and a half years have passed since he took\ncorrective action, Applicant failed to provide any additional facts which might tend to\nfurther mitigate security concerns. Without such information, it can only be concluded\nthat insufficient time has passed to reestablish the level of trust he once enjoyed with\nthe government for access to protected information. Consequently, Applicant has failed\nto mitigate personal conduct security concerns. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Here, little is known about the Applicant because he has declined\nto significantly expand the record beyond the documents contained in the FORM. What\nis known is that he is a mature man, just shy of age 40. His use of alcohol in his teens\nand 20s can be dismissed as youthful indiscretions, and he has demonstrated through\nnearly a decade of incident-free conduct that alcohol does not presently detract from his\nabilities, cause questionable judgment, or lead to impulsive behavior. \nApplicant has used marijuana, an illegal substance. He did so in his early 20s\nand into his 30s, but his use was sporadic and minimal. While his use included a\nsingular and isolated  incident that occurred as recently as May 2005, his declaration to\nnever again helps to allay concerns that drug use might impair his judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s denials concerning drug use, however, lead to serious questions\nregarding his personal conduct vis-a-vis his willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations, and his exercise of sound judgment. He has helped rehabilitate the quality\nof his judgment by voluntarily disclosing his past drug use. In doing so on the heels of\ncompleting an SF-86 in which he denied drug use, and following that denial weeks later\n\n AG \u00b6 2(b).\n14\n10\nwith another instance of drug use, however, leaves issues remaining about the\nconstancy of that judgment. With little more than his contrition and the passage of less\nthan three years since his disclosure to speak for his judgment in light of the scant\navailable facts, personal conduct security concerns remain unmitigated. Any doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information must be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  Clearance is revoked. \n14\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted seven and denied nine of the sixteen factual allegations in the SOR. His admissions are included in my findings of fact. Applicant is 30 years old, and has been a network operator and systems administrator with a defense contractor for over five years. He has received certificates of training in several network and security operations, to include network operations (App. Ex. A, Certificate, dated August 10, 2007); security (App. Ex. B, dated July 21, 2007); IT Technician (App. Ex. C, dated May 2, 2007; and Microsoft Professional (App. Ex. D, Microsoft, undated). He is not married. However, he lives with a girlfriend and they share living expenses. His monthly pay is $2,200 and her monthly salary is $2,500, for a combined $4,700 in monthly income. Their monthly expenses are about $4,000, leaving approximately $700 in monthly discretionary funds (Tr. 66-67; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 85P, dated March 25, 2005). Credit reports (Gov.

On May 19, 2009, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns for financial considerations under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 8, 2009. He admitted seven and \ndenied nine of the sixteen factual allegations. Applicant provided a detailed response to \nthe SOR on September 14, 2009, admitting and denying the same factual allegations. \nHe requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on November 17, 2009, and the case was assigned to me the next \nday. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on November 20, 2009, for a hearing on \nDecember 8, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered six \nexhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6, which were admitted \n1 \n \nFebruary 26, 2010\n\n2 \n \nwithout objection. Applicant submitted eight exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. \nEx.) A through H, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his \nbehalf. I left the record open until December 29, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments. No documents were submitted. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on December 22, 2009. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant stated at the hearing that he received the Notice of Hearing on or about \nDecember 3, 2009, five days prior to the hearing. However, Applicant dated his receipt \nof the Notice of Hearing December 14, 2009, six days after the hearing. Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days advance notice of the hearing (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8). Applicant \ndiscussed with Department Counsel the hearing date of December 8, 2009, prior to the \nNotice of Hearing being mailed so actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to \nthe hearing. At the hearing, Applicant waived the 15 days advance notice requirement \n(Tr. 5-7). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted seven and denied nine of the \nsixteen factual allegations in the SOR. His admissions are included in my findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old, and has been a network operator and systems \nadministrator with a defense contractor for over five years. He has received certificates \nof training in several network and security operations, to include network operations \n(App. Ex. A, Certificate, dated August 10, 2007); security (App. Ex. B, dated July 21, \n2007); IT Technician (App. Ex. C, dated May 2, 2007; and Microsoft Professional (App. \nEx. D, Microsoft, undated). He is not married. However, he lives with a girlfriend and \nthey share living expenses. His monthly pay is $2,200 and her monthly salary is $2,500, \nfor a combined $4,700 in monthly income. Their monthly expenses are about $4,000, \nleaving approximately $700 in monthly discretionary funds (Tr. 66-67; Gov. Ex. 1, SF \n85P, dated March 25, 2005). \n \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 3, dated July 2, 2005; Gov. Ex. 4, dated March 2, 2007; \nGov. Ex. 5, dated April 4, 2008; and Gov. Ex. 6, dated November 16, 2009) listed 16 \ndelinquent debts totaling approximately $26,000 owed by Applicant. Applicant admitted \nto seven of the debts totaling $12,000, and denied nine of the debts totaling $14,000. \nThe debts date back to 2005. The delinquent debts include an energy bill for $48 (SOR \n1.a); car repossession for $7,015 (SOR 1.b); another car repossession for $9,212 (SOR \n1.c); a telephone service debt for $188 (SOR 1.d); another telephone service debt for \n$1,046 (SOR 1.e); apartment rent for $1,265 (SOR 1.f); a pay day loan for $581 (SOR \n1.g); a credit card debt for $540 (SOR 1.h); a cable service debt for $557 (SOR 1.i); \nanother utility debt for $124 (SOR 1.j); a student loan for $2,206 (SOR 1.k); another \nenergy debt for $25 (SOR 1.l); a credit card debt for $1,350 (SOR 1.m); another credit \n\n3 \n \ncard debt for $346 (SOR 1.n); another telephone bill for $1,076 (SOR 1.o); and a debt to \na furniture company for $710 (SOR 1.p). Since 2007, Applicant's other debts have been \npaid and are current (Tr. 66). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.a for $48 is for an energy debt. The debt has been \npaid in full (Tr. 18-19; App. Ex. A, letter, date June 12, 2009). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.b for $7,015 is from a car repossession. Applicant \nbelieves the debt should be only for $5,000. Applicant co-signed for the debt with his \nthen girlfriend. The girlfriend drove the car and was suppose to make the car payments. \nShe made payments for about 18 months. Applicant learned of the repossession and \ndebt for this car when he received the SOR. He has not made any further payments on \nthe debt. His last discussion with the creditor was in March 2009 (Tr. 19-25). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.c for $9,212 is for a car repossession. Applicant \npurchased the car in 1999. He made payments for about two years until he lost his job. \nHe has not made any further payments or been in contact with the creditor (Tr. 25-27). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.d for $188 is for a telephone debt. The debt has \nbeen paid in full (Tr. 27-28; App. Ex. F, letter, dated June 12, 2009). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.e for $1,046 is for another telephone debt. It has \nbeen delinquent since 2002. Applicant stated he disputed the debt with the credit \nreporting agency and it was removed from his credit report. Applicant was to forward the \ndispute letter and documents resolving the dispute after the hearing. No documents \nwere received (Tr. 28-33). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.f for $1,265 is rent for an apartment Applicant \nrented before working for the defense contractor. Applicant left the apartment after he \nand his then girlfriend roommate had a disagreement. The roommate was to finish \npaying the lease. He does not understand why the debt is for $1,265 since the rent was \nonly $700 monthly. Applicant stated he has been making $100 monthly payments and \nwould forward receipts for these payments after the hearing. No documents were \nreceived (Tr. 33-35). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.g for $581 is for a pay-day loan. Applicant used \nthe money to visit his mother who was sick. The loan has been paid (Tr. 35-26; App. Ex. \nG, Paid in full letter, date June 3, 2009). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.h for $540 is for a bank account that was over \ndrawn. Applicant paid this debt (Tr. 37; Response to SOR, Letter, dated March 28, \n2008). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.i for $557 is a cable service debt. Applicant stated \nhe returned the cable equipment. He could not find the receipt, but he sent a dispute \nletter to the creditor, but did not receive a reply. He does not have a copy of the receipt \nfor the equipment or the dispute letter (Tr. 37-40). \n\n4 \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.j for $124, and SOR 1.l for $25, are for utility bills \nowed to the same utility company. Applicant called the creditor but the debts could not \nbe located. Applicant has not paid either debt. (Tr. 40-47). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.k for $2,206 is to a university for school tuition. \nApplicant does not understand why he has this debt. While attending school, he was \nreceiving student financial aid. Applicant sent a dispute letter to the credit reporting \nagency, but did not send a letter to the school. He did not receive a reply from his letter. \nHowever, the debt is no longer on his credit report (Tr. 47-50). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.m for $1,350 is for a credit card Applicant received \nwhen he left high school in 1998. Applicant believes the debt should be for only $700. \nHe has not made any payments on this debt (Tr. 50-54).  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.n for $346 is for a credit card. Applicant tried to \npay the debt from his bank account but provided the wrong account number. The \naccount has not been paid (Tr. 54-56).  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.o for $1,076 is for a telephone debt to the same \ncreditor listed in SOR 1.e. Applicant believes the debts at SOR 1.e and 1.o are \nduplicates. However, the debts are for different amounts, have different account \nnumbers, and have different start dates. Neither the debt at SOR 1.e or SOR 1.o has \nbeen paid (Tr. 56-64). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.p for $710 is for furniture. The debt has been paid \nin full (Tr. 64-65; App. Ex. H, Letter, dated June 4, 2009). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all \navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \n\"assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d Trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA \nby the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management (See, The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004). Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded \nthe right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable \naccess determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust or a sensitive position, \nthe administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision (AG \u00b6 2(c)). \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect sensitive \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a public trust position. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt-free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, as established by credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s statements and testimony, are a security concern raising Financial \n\n6 \n \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nApplicant has 16 delinquent debts consisting of utility bills, credit cards, telephone \nservice debts, cable service charges, student loans, and pay-day loans that have been \ndelinquent for some time, indicating a history of not meeting financial obligations, as \nwell as an inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). These mitigating conditions do not apply. Applicant paid in \nfull five of the delinquent accounts mostly in mid 2009 (SOR 1.a, 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, 1.p). \nApplicant stated he is making payments of $100 monthly on one debt but he did not \nprovide documentation of payments even though provided the opportunity (SOR 1.f). \nThe remaining debts became delinquent as early as 2002, are still unpaid, and are thus \ncurrent debts. The debts were incurred in the normal course of life and there were no \nunusual reasons or reasons beyond his control for the debts. Since the delinquent debts \narose in the normal course of living and not for any unusual reasons, the debts could \nlikely recur.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. The \nconcept of good-faith action requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Applicant \nmust establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \"meaningful track record\" \nof debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments. An applicant \nis not required to establish that he paid off each and every debt listed. The entirety of an \napplicant\u2019s financial situation and his actions can reasonably be considered in \nevaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \ndetermination. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrates that he has \nestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems and has taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan. Applicant has paid five of the debts (SOR 1.a, 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, 1.p). \nHe stated he is making payments on one of the debts, but failed to present proof of \npayment even though provided the opportunity (SOR 1.f). He has not made contact with \nor paid five other creditors (SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.j, 1.n, and 1.o). His payment of five of the \ndebts is some indication of good-faith. However, the majority of his delinquent debts \nremain unpaid or unaddressed. Applicant failed to establish a meaningful track record of \ndebt payments, and that he acted reasonably, with prudence, honesty, and an \nadherence to a duty or obligation.  \n\n7 \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute \nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumentation to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \ntaken to resolve the issue). The mitigating condition does not apply. Applicant stated he \ndisputed four of the debts (SOR 1.e, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.m). He did not provide \ndocumentation of his disputes even though he said he was able and provided the \nopportunity. Based upon the information provided by Applicant, it does not appear he \nhad a reasonable basis for his disputes. His only dispute on one of the debts was the \namount of the debt (SOR 1.m).  \n \nApplicant stated he believed SOR 1.e and 1.o were duplicates but he presented \nno documentation to establish the duplication. In fact, from the information available, it \nappears they are separate debts.  \n \nApplicant's lack of action to pay his debts is significant and constitutes credible \ninformation to show that he has not acted reasonably under the circumstances. \nApplicant has not acted responsibly towards his debts and finances under the \ncircumstances. Applicant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate security \nconcerns for financial considerations because he did not establish that the reasons for \nhis debts were beyond his control and that he took reasonable and responsible efforts \nto manage his finances. His finances indicate a public trust concern.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \n   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant is a good \nemployee who has been trained in his field of network operations.  \n \n\n8 \n \n \nApplicant paid five debts. Applicant has not established a meaningful track record \nof paying his remaining delinquent debts. He stated he had receipts for payments and \nletters of disputes, but he did not provide documentation to verify payments or disputes \non his other debts. He was provided the opportunity to present verifiable documentation. \nNone was received. He has yet to contact some creditors. Applicant has not provided \nsufficient credible documentary information to show he acted reasonably and \nresponsibly towards his debts. His failure to act reasonably and responsibly towards his \nfinances indicates he may not act reasonably and responsibly to protect sensitive \ninformation. In the future, if Applicant is able to establish a meaningful track record of \ndebt payment and reduction, and provide sufficient credible documentation, he should \nbe afforded the opportunity to establish eligibility for a position of public trust. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial situation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i - 1.o: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, and he admits, in part, the allegation in \u00b6 1.c. He denies the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 2.a. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 37-year-old security analyst/engineer who is employed by a company engaged in defense contracting. He attended community college during 1993\u20131995, and he was awarded a general education degree in January 1995. He then attended a state university where he earned a 3 bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology in May 1999. He is twice divorced, and he is currently living with a woman he has been seeing since March 2007. He is the father of a 13-year-old son from a previous relationship. He started working for his current employer in July 2000. He obtained a secret-level security clearance from the Defense Department in 2003. His current application (Exhibit 1) was submitted to upgrade Applicant to a top-secret security clearance (R. 161\u2013162). Applicant was required to answer a series of questions about his background in his March 2004 security-clearance application (Exhibit 1). He is accused of providing a deliberately false answer to Question 19, which is a two-part question phrased as follows: In the last 7 years, have you consulted a mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.) or have you consulted with another health care provider ",

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nMelvin A. Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDavid P. Price, Esq. \nSYNOPSIS\nFrom about 1992 to 2005, Applicant engaged in domestic violence with two girlfriends and\ntwo spouses. His conduct included spitting on women on three occasions. None of these incidents\nresulted in arrests, charges, or convictions. Although he is making progress in addressing his\nchildhood and anger-management issues, it is too soon to tell if this period of his life is a thing of\nthe past or a firmly ingrained pattern of behavior that is likely to recur. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nThis is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on May 23, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it\ndetails the factual basis for the action. The issues in this case fall under Guideline J for criminal\nconduct and Guideline E for personal conduct based on an alleged falsification of a security-\nclearance application.      \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn June 29, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took\nplace on November 13, 2007, and the transcript was received on November 21, 2007.\nThe record was left open until November 30  to allow Applicant to submit an additional item\nth\nof documentary evidence. It was timely received and it is admitted as Exhibit F without objections.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nThe SOR was amended in two ways without objections from either side. First, it was\namended to reflect Applicant\u2019s correct social security account number (R. 4\u20135). Second, it was\namended by moving the allegation in \u00b6 2.a under Guideline E and placing it under Guideline J as \u00b6\n1.g, and then by renumbering the allegation in \u00b6 2.b as \u00b6 2.a (R. 9\u201312). \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e,\nand 1.f, and he admits, in part, the allegation in \u00b6 1.c. He denies the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 2.a.\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old security analyst/engineer who is employed by a company engaged\nin defense contracting. He attended community college during 1993\u20131995, and he was awarded a\ngeneral education degree in January 1995. He then attended a state university where he earned a\n\n3\nbachelor\u2019s degree in psychology in May 1999. He is twice divorced, and he is currently living with\na woman he has been seeing since March 2007. He is the father of a 13-year-old son from a previous\nrelationship. He started working for his current employer in July 2000. He obtained a secret-level\nsecurity clearance from the Defense Department in 2003. His current application (Exhibit 1) was\nsubmitted to upgrade Applicant to a top-secret security clearance (R. 161\u2013162). \nApplicant was required to answer a series of questions about his background in his March\n2004 security-clearance application (Exhibit 1). He is accused of providing a deliberately false\nanswer to Question 19, which is a two-part question phrased as follows:\nIn the last 7 years, have you consulted a mental health professional (psychiatrist,\npsychologist, counselor, etc.) or have you consulted with another health care provider\nabout a mental health related condition?\nDid the mental health related consultation(s) involve only marital, family, or grief\ncounseling not related to violence by you?\nApplicant responded \u201cyes\u201d to both questions. \nHaving experienced a difficult childhood, Applicant left home at age 18 after completing\nhigh school. He worked for several years as a merchandise stocker and then a cashier for wholesale\nwarehouse store. In about 1992, he met the woman with whom he would have a son. Their\nrelationship was ongoing when their son was born in 1994. Sometime thereafter, with the assistance\nof counseling, they decided to not marry believing it would be better for their son due to the\ndifficulties in their relationship. The difficulties included an incident where Applicant admits hitting,\njabbing, or punching her in the side during an argument (Exhibit 2 at 3). Another incident is where\nApplicant displayed a loaded pistol in a threatening manner to the woman (Exhibit 2 at 3). The\nwoman has no recollection of the firearm incident (Exhibit C2). Applicant recalls the incident and\ndescribed it as follows:\nI remember pointing the gun at her and acting like - - it was almost a playful but\nsexually charged - - this sounds really bad, obviously, - - but kind of playing and\ncontrol in a relationship, the locust of control or something like that, and we didn\u2019t\n- - we didn\u2019t have intercourse. It wasn\u2019t a rape situation. But it was like, this is what\nyou can do with a gun and look at this. It has power and all this. But, obviously, now\nI don\u2019t have any - - any bone in my body that I would ever disrespect another human\nbeing or mishandle a firearm in that manner (R. 100-101).\nApplicant married his first wife in January 1997, and they divorced in February 1998 (Exhibit\n1). There were two incidents with her. The first took place when they were mountain biking and had\nan argument. Applicant lost his temper and spit on her. The second took place when they were\nhaving an argument in the bedroom and he pushed her onto the bed.\n In 1999, Applicant had sexual intercourse with a girl he met through a friend. Applicant\ndescribed the incident in a written statement as follows:\n\n4\nIn about 1999, when I was twenty nine years old, I had sex with an underaged girl.\nOne of my good friends had a cousin that was attracted to me. The cousin was\nbetween age sixteen and eighteen at the time. I believe she may have been sixteen.\nWe had consensual sexual intercourse one time. I was not married at the time and\nthere were no allegations against me for sex with a minor (Exhibit 2 at 1). \nApplicant acknowledges he used poor judgement in this situation (R. 109). He explains the incident\nas a period when he felt lonely and thought it might soothe his loneliness. This appears to be an\nisolated incident, as there is no other evidence of similar behavior.\nApplicant completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1999, and started work with his current\nemployer in July 2000. He met his second wife through  work, she worked at the same company,\nand he introduced himself to her while riding on a commuter train. They married sometime in 2004,\nbut their marriage was short-lived. His spouse obtained a restraining order against Applicant in late\n2004 concurrent with commencing divorce proceedings, which was final in January 2006. Applicant\nrecalls three incidents during their relationship. \nThe first incident took place in early 2004 when Applicant was working on a clothes dryer\nwith a screwdriver. An argument took place, and at one point Applicant stood up and said to her that\nhe was so angry he could shove the screwdriver in her. Although he did not intend to threaten her,\nhe saw that she was scared and felt threatened. He put the screwdriver on the counter and they settled\nthe argument.\nThe second incident was in mid-2004 when Applicant and the woman were driving home\nfrom a social event. A back-and-forth argument was ongoing. Applicant told her that if they did not\nstop arguing he would kill her. He explained that he did not mean it, but was trying to stop the\nargument  by showing how their bickering could only lead to a negative conclusion and used that\nstatement as a negative example.\nThe third incident in 2004 took place during an argument over money. Applicant discovered\nthat the woman had lied to him about money and that she had spent about $10,000 without telling\nhim. Applicant spit in the woman\u2019s face during the argument. \nAfter separating from his second wife, but before the divorce was final in January 2006,\nApplicant became involved with another woman whom he referred to as his current girlfriend in his\nNovember 2006 written statement (Exhibit 2 at 3). They began cohabiting in August 2005. In his\nwritten statement, he admits spitting in her face during an argument in 2005. He also admits being\naggressive with her four or five times during their relationship, and he admits being verbally abusive\ntoward her.   \nAfter the 2005 spitting incident, Applicant began counseling on a weekly basis as his then\ngirlfriend requested he obtain counseling due to his bad temper (Exhibit A1). Applicant did so and\nreceived a diagnosis of mild depression. Applicant was cooperative and improved during the\ncounseling, which continued until he was informed that the healthcare insurer would not pay for the\nservices. \n\n5\nApplicant found a counselor who would be covered by his insurance. He began counseling\nin September 2005 (Exhibit A2), and this counseling continues to date. Applicant has had nearly 70\nsessions with the counselor, a licensed psychologist who limits her practice to adult psychology. The\ninitial diagnosis of Applicant was adult adjustment relationship disorder/anxiety. He was not\nprescribed any medication and has been treated primarily with talk therapy. His diagnosis changed\nto post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) stemming from Applicant\u2019s childhood history of adoption,\nthe death by suicide of his adopted mother, neglect by his adopted father, and abuse (physical and\nsexual) by two stepmothers. As a result, Applicant has problems with relationships with women,\nhe has a lack of trust, and he feels abandoned. The psychologist confirmed at the hearing that\nApplicant\u2019s PTSD is a current diagnosis and that the prognosis is very good (R. 53\u201354). She opined\nthat Applicant has shown willingness to work on his issues and he is proficient at using techniques\nto manage his anger. Also, she opined that they are approximately 80% to 85% complete in\naddressing Applicant\u2019s issues. \nIn addition to the counseling, Applicant recently completed an anger-management program.\nThe six-session program started in September 2007 and Applicant completed it in November 2007\n(Exhibits A3 and F). The crux of the program was to teach cognitive/behavioral strategies to cope\nwith anger in daily life, and Applicant did well in the program (Exhibit A3).\nApplicant began a new relationship with a woman he met in March 2007. They have\ndeveloped a close relationship and began cohabiting recently. She believes Applicant has improved\nhis communication skills during their relationship, and, as a result, they have improved their ability\nto handle and resolve conflicts in their relationship. There have been no incidents of domestic\nviolence between them. She has not observed Applicant engage in any inappropriate behavior or\nlanguage in the presence of her children. Likewise, she has seen him be a kind and loving father to\nhis son. She believes he has been a positive influence in her life. \nIn addition to his current girlfriend, Applicant enjoys a friendship with the mother of his son\n(Exhibit C2). She believes that his best character trait is his honesty. When their son was about five\nyears old, she and Applicant reached a voluntary agreement that Applicant would pay $400 per\nmonth child support, and he has made those payments on a regular basis. He has become more active\nin parenting their son and often spends time with his son hunting, fishing, hiking, and sailing.\nRecently, the child support payment increased to $600 per month (R. 130\u2013131). \nApplicant has enjoyed a good deal of success in his current employment as evidenced by\nperformance reviews, bonuses, and pay raises over the years (Exhibit B). For example, his annual\nsalary has increased from $50,000 in 2000 to his current salary of $86,000. A fellow employee\ndescribes Applicant as a responsible and ethical employee who is able to connect with his coworkers\nand has a sense of humor along with an even-keeled personality (Exhibit C3). \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n6\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 10\u201312 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n14\n Revised Guidelines at p. 10.\n15\n See Directive, Enclosure 1, \u00b6 3(1) (an SOR is required to be as comprehensive and detailed as the national\n16\nsecurity permits).\n7\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements, credible adverse\n14\ninformation that may not be enough to support action under any other guideline, and other personal\nconduct of concern. In particular, a security concern may arise due to \u201c[c]onduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations [that may] raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability\nto protect classified information. Of special concern is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d  For an answer, statement, or omission to be deliberately false, it must done\n15\nknowingly and willfully. It is not deliberately false if the person genuinely forgot about the\ninformation, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported. \nThe SOR alleges in \u00b6 2.a that Applicant gave a false answer to the second part of Question\n19 of his security-clearance application by answering \u201cyes,\u201d which indicated the consultation he\nobtained was not related to violence by him. In particular, the allegation asserts that Applicant\n\u201cdeliberately failed to disclose that [Applicant] had mental health consultation for [his] abuse toward\nwomen, both emotionally and physically.\u201d The allegation does not state the who, where, or when of\nthe consultation.  Obviously, the counseling that Applicant started in 2005 was not required to be\n16\ndisclosed in 2004 when the security-clearance application was completed. The government\u2019s\nevidence does not affirmatively establish the specific mental health consultation that is alleged to\nhave been omitted (Exhibits 1 and 2). Applicant\u2019s recollection and testimony on this matter is also\ninconclusive, as he explained that he obtained counseling after his first divorce (R. 121\u2013124). A\ndeliberate falsification is not established given the vagueness of both the SOR allegation and the\nrecord evidence. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided for Applicant. \n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 21\u201322 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n17\n Revised Guidelines at p. 21. \n18\n DC 3 is \u201callegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\n19\nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n MC 4 is \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\n20\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training of higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\u201d \n8\nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the security concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n17\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls\ninto question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d18\nThe allegation of intercourse with the minor in SOR \u00b6 2.d is not of particular concern. First,\nthe only evidence that the person was a \u201cminor\u201d is Applicant\u2019s estimation of her age. Second, no\nevidence was introduced concerning the age of consent in the particular jurisdiction. Third, it\nhappened in 1999, which is several years ago, and there is no indication of similar behavior. To sum\nup, it appears to be an isolated incident of situational behavior and it is mitigated based on passage\nof time without recurrence. Plainly, this incident is not the gravamen of the SOR, which is\nApplicant\u2019s history of domestic violence based on his problematic relationships with women. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of unadjudicated criminal\nconduct, as he has never been arrested, charged, or convicted. Nevertheless, the evidence supports\na conclusion that Applicant has engaged in criminal conduct generally known in the law as assault,\nbattery, and communication of a threat. These matters fall within the meaning of DC 3  of the\n19\nguideline. \nAlso, the evidence shows he has a history of personal relationships where he has\ndemonstrated poor judgment. Of particular concern here are the firearm incident and the spitting\nincidents. Displaying a loaded firearm in a home is high-risk behavior in most circumstances. Given\nthe circumstances here, Applicant\u2019s use of the loaded firearm was a foolish and dangerous act. His\nspitting on women was despicable conduct. Spitting on another person is a provocative act intended\nto degrade. His conduct in spitting on women demonstrates an extreme lack of respect for women\nand provides some insight into his problematic relationships with women. His demonstrated lack of\nrespect for the women in his life calls into question his willingness to respect the rules for handling\nand safeguarding classified information. \nAll of the MCs under the guideline have been considered and Applicant receives some credit\nin mitigation. The most pertinent matter in mitigation is MC 4,  which addresses evidence of\n20\nsuccessful rehabilitation. Applicant has produced substantial evidence of the following: (1) long-\nterm and ongoing counseling that is addressing his childhood and relationship issues; (2) completing\nan anger-management program; (3) a good employment record; and (4) a stable relationship with a\nwoman since March 2007. Taken together, these facts and circumstances are evidence of reform and\nrehabilitation. Applicant knows he has a serious problem and he is making efforts to address it. \n\n9\nTo sum up under the whole-person concept, this case presents both disqualifying and\nmitigating information, which requires thoughtful balancing. Applicant is 37 years old and\nsufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about how he interacts with the women in his life. The\ndiagnosis of PTSD helps to explain the source of his anger and somewhat extenuates his acting out\non his anger. He has made progress in addressing his issues through counseling and he is\ncommended for his efforts. But at this point Applicant is a work in progress. It is simply too soon\nto tell if Applicant has truly resolved this period of his life, or if this period is substantial evidence\nof a firmly ingrained pattern of behavior that is likely to occur again when Applicant hits the normal\nbumps in the road that one encounters with personal relationships. Based on this record, the\nlikelihood of recurrence is more probable than not, and that assessment is contrary to the clearly-\nconsistent standard applicable to this case. \nAfter weighing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant has not explained, extenuated, or\nmitigated the criminal conduct security concern. And Applicant has not overcome the case against\nhim and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nAccordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a, b, c, e, f, g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph d:\nFor Applicant \nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

O\u2019Brien, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nEric Adams, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is a high regarded member of a defense contractor who has a  history of delinquent\ndebts, which he accumulated during a lengthy military deployment between 1996 and 1997.\nApplicant has received counseling and initiated substantial successful efforts before the issuance of\nthe SOR to restore his credit.  Of the two debts listed as delinquent in the SOR, one is disputed and\nthe other is barred by the relevant statute of limitations.  Both debts have since been removed from\nApplicant\u2019s latest credit report, which contains no listed delinquent debts.  Based on Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial counseling, repayment efforts he has demonstrated to date, and engendered whole person\ntrust, he mitigates security concerns associated with his past history of delinquent debts.  Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 26, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case\nwas assigned to me on March 28, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on June 5, 2007.  A hearing\nwas convened on June 5, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At\nhearing, the Government's case consisted of no witnesses and two  exhibits; Applicant relied on one\nwitness (himself) and five exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on June 14, 2007.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nApplicant is a 42-year-old program integrator for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein\nby reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nWhile on military deployment during the 1996-1997 time frame, Applicant accrued debts\nwith two of his creditors that he was not able to take care of.  Before leaving for deployment, he gave\nhis mother $10,000.00 to cover her expenses in his absence.  His mother had lost her job, and his\nstepfather\u2019s company was preparing to go on strike (R.T., at 20-21).  During his deployment he was\noverpaid on his housing allowance and had no backup sources to cover the overpayments in lieu of\npay deductions.  So, in the interim while he was awaiting his return to full payment status he got\nbehind with several of his creditors (R.T., at 22-23).  When he returned from deployment in 1999,\nhe found several accounts in delinquent status (including his bank debt with the predecessor of L)\n(R.T., at 24).\nIn hopes of consolidating his debts, Applicant applied for an AE account in 1998.  But before\nhe could obtain an answer from AE, he was redeployed (R.T., at 24-25).  When he returned from\ndeployment in early 1999 he learned that AE had approved his account request and transferred the\n\n3\nbalances from his other accounts into this new account, creating a consolidated account (R.T., at 25-\n26).   Since 1998, Applicant has not created any new delinquent debts (R.T., at 26).\nApplicant retired from active duty in September 2004 (ex. 1; R.T., at 27).  Just before his\nofficial retirement, he went to work for his current employer (i.e., in August 2004).  Shortly after he\njoined his current employer\u2019s staff, he initiated efforts to restore his credit.  He considered\nbankruptcy but eventually accepted his attorney\u2019s advice and signed up for consumer counseling and\ndebt consolidation with Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS) (R.T., at 30-31).  After paying\nover $6,000.00 to $8,000.00 a year to CCCS over the course of three years (1999 to 20002) to pay\noff his debts, he experienced problems with the counseling service and  switched firms (R.T., at 32-\n33). \nThrough the efforts of the new consolidation firm he engaged (a law firm), Applicant was\nable to pay off his bank debt for about $3,900.00 in 2003 (R.T., at 52-54, 64-65).  Before he paid this\ndebt, though, the bank assigned its debt to a collection agency, who later it sold the debt to L (R.T.,\nat 56-57).  Applicant\u2019s efforts to obtain his payment documentation from the law firm (which has\nsince gone out of business) have been unsuccessful. This law firm apparently filed a bankruptcy\npetition in Applicant\u2019s behalf without notifying him.  Applicant was able to able to enlist the\ntrustee\u2019s assistance in withdrawing this unauthorized petition.  \nUpon seeing the L account appear in his December 2005 credit report (ex. 2), Applicant\ndisputed the debt with the credit reporting agencies.  Acting on Applicant\u2019s dispute of the L debt,\nthe credit reporting agencies have since removed the L debt (in approximately 2006) from their\nrecords (see ex. A; R.T., at 36-38, 58, 67-69).  \nApplicant makes no claim of satisfying the listed AE debt.  But he did make payments to\nCCCS for satisfying his known creditors, including AE (see ex. C; R.T., at 59-60), and is able\ndocument settling one of his AE accounts (see ex. E). Neither CCCS nor the law firm he\nsubsequently engage, however, apparently paid this AE debt (R.T., at 60-61).  Since over seven years\nhave elapsed since the AE debt became delinquent, he claims application of the governing statute\nof limitation (R.T., at 62), while still expressing an intent to eventually pay off this debt.\nBecause Applicant\u2019s listed AE debt is barred by the governing statute of limitations, he is\nreluctant to reaffirm this AE debt anew and enter into repayment arrangements.  To do so could\ntrigger the beginning of a new statute of limitations period (R.T., at 40-41). So, rather than begin\npaying on the AE account, he is accumulating funds with which he hopes to use in making a lump-\nsum settlement offer to AE.  He hopes to generate something between $10,000.00 and $15,000.00\nfrom his earnings and retirement, and then contact an attorney about reaching a settlement with AE\n(R.T., at 41-45, 71-72).  In the meantime, the AE debt is no longer reported on his latest credit\nreports (see ex. A).  Although, the AE debt was not deleted from Applicant\u2019s credit report until\nsometime in 2006, Applicant is uncertain whether the removal of the AE account had anything to\ndo with the running of any applicable statutes of limitation in his state.  \nAside from the two debts covered in the SOR (i.e., the AE and L debts), Applicant is current\nwith all of his accounts listed in his credit report.  Since restoring his credit, he has been able to buy\na house and reports a very good credit score of 727 (see ex. A; R.T., at 39-40).  He reports an annual\nincome of around $76,000.00 and a military retirement of $25,000.00 (R.T., at 48).  He currently has\n\n4\nabout $6,000.00 in savings (put aside to pay his AE debt), a 401(k) retirement account valued at\n$23,000.00, and no other stocks and investments (R.T., at 49-51, 73-76).  In addition to paying on\na mortgage he recently secured on his home (R.T., at 76-77),  he continues to help his  mother with\nher expenses: He sends her between $300.00 and $500.00 a month (R.T., at 28-29).\nApplicant has excellent character references and credit references.  He is current with all of\nhis remaining creditors.  His supervisor credits him with excellent performance evaluations and work\nethics (see ex. B).  Applicant\u2019 former military associates also characterize him as reliable and\ntrustworthy (ex. B).\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead\nto financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\napplicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make\na common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of\nan applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those\ninferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\nsecurity clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his\nor her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\n  CONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a program integrator with two delinquent debts he accumulated some years ago:\none during a military deployment between 1996 and 1997, and another associated with a post-\ndeployment effort to consolidate his debts.  One of the debts (associated with L) he paid, and then\ndisputed the ensuing claim of a creditor assignee.  The other debt (the AE debt) is since barred by\nthe applicable statute of limitations. Although Applicant presents an overall positive credit history\nwith a high credit score, the previously reported delinquent debts were significantly substantial to\nraise Government security concerns. \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the Regulation\nwhere the individual applicant is so financially overextended that he or she is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and his failure\nto document payments of the two debts in issue (i.e., his AE and L debts warrant the application of\ntwo of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for financial\nconsiderations: DC 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and DC 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations).\n Both his AE and L debts are extenuated to some extent, and MC 20 (b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under th circumstances) has some applicability given his\nmother\u2019s/stepfather\u2019s situation before he deployed in 1996 and his overpayment problems he\nexperienced on deployment.\nTo his credit, Applicant initiated credit counseling with CCCS following his military\ndischarge and paid off most of his debts through the program before he experienced disagreements\nwith the counseling service and switched firms.  Through the efforts of the law firm that handled his\ndebts before going out of business, Applicant addressed one of the two listed debts.  This debt was\nsubsequently assigned to a credit collection agency (L), which Applicant disputed.  His most recent\ncredit report reflects the removal of both of his listed debts and current status of all of his remaining\nlisted debts.  Based on his counseling and repayment efforts to date, he may take advantage of two\nof the mitigating conditions (MC) of the financial considerations guideline: MC 20 (c) (the person\n\n6\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control) and MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. \nMC 20 (e) (the individual has reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt\nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the\ndispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) also has  application to the facts of this\ncase.  True, Applicant does not dispute the bank debt as one of his creation: He disputes L\u2019s\nownership of the debt that he assures he satisfied before the debt was resold  to L.  While the Appeal\nBoard has never defined the meaning of the term \u201clegitimacy\u201d in MC 20(e), the term can reasonably\nbe construed to include not just disputes over the origins of the debt, but subsequent assignments as\nwell, and possibly even enforcement issues (such as statutes of limitations).\nAt the very least, MC 20(e) is capable of embracing debt ownership questions (such as L\u2019s\ndisputed assignment).   Reasonable grounds for Applicant\u2019s disputing the L debt is documented  by\nthe debt\u2019s removal from Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities,\namong which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.   Financial stability in a person cleared\nto access classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of\nthe clearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties\nis vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases\n(as here) and bring into play security concerns covered by the financial consideration guideline.\nHere, Applicant satisfies that one of his debts was disputed (the L debt), and the other is barred by\nhis State\u2019s relevant statute of limitations.\nWhile statutes of limitation in general are considered important policy tools for discouraging\nplaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation, they have never been\nequated with good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 02-30304, at\n3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).  And so,\nreliance on his State\u2019s statute of limitations bar to excuse payment of his AE debt is not by itself\ndispositive of security concerns.  However, the AE debt appears to be the only remaining debt on\nApplicant\u2019s credit report that represents an acknowledged undischarged debt.  The debt, as such, is\nisolated and one that is not likely to recur.  Applicant may invoke MC 20(a) (the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) under\nthe circumstances of his case.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt\naccumulations, his efforts to seek counseling and  restore his credit, and his overall demonstration\nof solid performance evaluations and demonstrated trustworthiness, Applicant mitigates security\nconcerns related to his past debt delinquencies and judgment lapses associated therein.  Favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline F.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nDE CISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

In 2000 and 2003, he had convictions for driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. In both\ninstances, his driver\u2019s license was suspended. In 2004, he was convicted of driving on a suspended\nlicense. He served 40 days in jail for that offense. He was on probation from 2004 through January\n2007 and did not consume alcohol during this period. He now has an occasional drink. Applicant has\nmitigated the criminal conduct and alcohol consumption security concerns. Clearance is granted.\n\nEx. 1 (Security Clearance Application, signed on August 23, 2005).\n1\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 23, 2005, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security clearance, and issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR)  on May 2, 2007, detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns\n2\nraised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. Department Counsel\nindicated the Government was ready to proceed on June 21, 2007. The case was assigned to me on\nJune 22, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on July 11, 2007, scheduling the hearing for August\n1, 2007. On July 19, 2007, Applicant\u2019s attorney moved for a continuance of the hearing to a date to\nbe determined later. The motion was granted without objection. On July 20, 2007, an Amended\nNotice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for August 8, 2007. The hearing was conducted\nas scheduled. At the hearing, the Government submitted exhibits 1-3, and Applicant submitted\nexhibits A-B. All exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on August 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations. Those admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 37 years old and has worked as a design engineer for a defense contractor since\n2005. He served in the Navy from 1993 to 1997, spending the majority of time in the Persian Gulf.\nHe received an honorable discharge. In September 2006, Applicant received a bachelor of science\ndegree in criminal justice and graduated magna cum laude. His first marriage ended in divorce. He\nremarried in July 2006. He held security clearances in the past.\nOne evening in October 2000, upon leaving a nightclub after having numerous drinks,\nApplicant was pulled over by the police for failure to turn on his headlights. Applicant was arrested\nand eventually convicted for DUI. He was sentenced to five days in jail, fined $1,000, placed on\nprobation for one year, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year.\nIn November 2003, Applicant was out drinking with a friend. His friend needed a ride to the\nairport. While driving a friend to the airport, he was pulled over by the police for not having a front\nlicense plate and given a Breathalyzer test.

He had an alcoholic drink the\nnight before.  He subsequently completed the court-ordered counseling.\n3\nIn August 2004, Applicant was charged with driving after his license was suspended and\neluding the police. The charge for eluding the police was nolle prosequi,  dismissed. He was\n4\nsentenced to 90 days in jail but served 40 days due to good behavior, fined $1,000, ordered to attend\nalcohol counseling with a physician, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year. He\ncompleted the court-ordered counseling. \nApplicant\u2019s wife and two other witnesses testified on his behalf. All three have security\nclearances and unequivocally support Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance. One witness\nhas known Applicant since 1998 and they have both a professional and personal relationship.  He\n5\nhas seen positive changes in Applicant\u2019s lifestyle since Applicant\u2019s incarceration. He believes that\nApplicant\u2019s incarceration \u201cput the fear of God in him. It changed his life.\u201d  Another witness also\n6\nworks with Applicant and has known him for a little more than two years and in fact hired\nApplicant.  When Applicant was hired, this witness was aware of his arrests for DUI and driving on\n7\na suspended license.  Applicant was hired because he already held a security clearance.  Applicant\u2019s\n8\n9\nwife knew him two years before they dated.  She stated that between the time he got out of jail in\n10\n2004 and the end of his probation in January 2007, he did not drink alcohol.

She believes that his\n12\n13\ntime in jail changed his perspective for the better about drinking and driving.14\nApplicant abstained from alcohol from the time he got out of jail in 2004, until his probation\nended in January 2007. In his Answer, Applicant stated this about himself:\nI have traveled on official business with the [government agency] to over 83 cities\nthrough the world and never once put myself in a position to hurt my fellow\nAmericans and never would. I have never been an individual who would ever\njeopardize the government\u2019s interests, my country or the individuals I work with.\nApplicant has amended his drinking behavior and has the occasional drink, but he no longer\ndrives if he has been drinking. He is usually the designated driving when he and his wife go out.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n15\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n16\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n17\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n18\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n19\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n20\n6\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.20\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nCriminal Conduct\nCriminal conduct under Guideline J may be a security concern because \u201ccriminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls\ninto question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6\n31)\nIn 2000, Applicant was arrested for DUI and sentenced to five days in jail, fined $1,000,\nplaced on probation for a year, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for a year. In 2003, he was\narrested for DUI. He spent two days in jail, fined $650, ordered to attend counseling and alcohol\nsupport classes, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for three years. Approximately nine weeks\ninto his court-ordered counseling and alcohol support classes, he was given a Breathalyzer and blew\na .001 or .01, which was in violation of the program\u2019s rules. Moreover, in 2004, he was charged and\nconvicted of driving after forfeiting his driver\u2019s license. He served 40 days in jail, was fined $1,000,\nordered to attend alcohol counseling with a physician, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for one\nyear. Consequently, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses) and \u00b6 32(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate criminal conduct. In 2000, Applicant was convicted for DUI,\njailed, fined, and placed on probation for one year. In 2003, he was again convicted for DUI, fined,\nincarcerated, ordered to attend alcohol counsel, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for three\nyears. In 2004, he was charged with driving after his license was suspended. He was jailed for 40\ndays, fined, ordered to attend counseling, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended. His probation ends\nin October 2008. While in counseling, he violated the program\u2019s rules by drinking alcohol the night\nbefore. His behavior has changed because he no longer drinks. He has been alcohol-free since May\n2006 and as a result, he has not participated in any other criminal activities. Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training\nor higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement) applies.\n\n7\nAlcohol Consumption\nAlcohol consumption is always a security concern because \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption\noften leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21)\nIn 2000 and 2003, Applicant was arrested and convicted for DUI. In 2000, he served five\ndays in jail, was placed on probation for a year, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for a year.\nIn the 2003 DUI offense, he spent two days in jail, was ordered to attend counseling and alcohol\nsupport classes, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for three years. Moreover, while attending\nthe court-ordered counseling and alcohol support classes, he failed a Breathalyzer test. Consequently,\nAlcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from\nwork, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the\npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent) and AG \u00b6 22(g) (failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol\neducation, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence) applies.\nVarious factors can mitigate alcohol consumption. From 2000 through 2004, Applicant was\nbreaking the law, getting to trouble, and drinking to excess as evidenced by his DUIs and evidenced\nby driving with a suspended license. Applicant spent about 40 days in jail. His incarceration, which\nto him was a lengthy period of time, changed his perspective on how alcohol could influence his life.\nHe remained alcohol-free while on probation. He now has an occasional drink. Based on those facts,\nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions, AG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her\nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol\nabuser)) applies.\nI have considered all of the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Since his\nincarceration in 2004, Applicant has modified his behavior toward alcohol consumption. Enough time\nhas elapsed for Applicant to show that he is unwilling to be incarcerated for any length of time. Thus,\nhe is no longer excessively drinking alcohol. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable\nfor access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Kline, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant was cited for possession of marijuana in 2000 and 2006. He did not list \nthe 2000 citation on his security clearance questionnaire because it had been dismissed \nand expunged and he did not believe he had to list it. Applicant has rebutted or \nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under drug involvement, personal \nconduct, and criminal conduct. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nDecember 17, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July 2, 2008, detailing security concerns \nunder drug involvment, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. \n \n \nOn August 8, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nSeptember 23, 2008, I was assigned the case. On September 29, 2009, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on October 21, 2008. The government \noffered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant and his \nfather testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf and submitted Exhibits A through C, which were \nadmitted into evidence. On October 30, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n2. a, and 3.c. He admitted the remaining factual allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old analyst who has worked for a defense contractor since \nApril 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Friends and co-workers state \nApplicant is a person of unquestioned dedication and loyalty. He is hard working, \nconscientious, diligent, industrious, trustworthy, intelligent, dedicated, competent, and a \nconsiderate young man. He accepts responsibility, uses excellent judgment in dealing \nwith sensitive personnel information, and performs his work with speed, accuracy, and \nefficiency. (Ex. B) \n \n \nApplicant was a good high school student graduating in the top 10% of his class. \nApplicant received academic scholarships for college. Applicant maintains good credit \nand has a credit score of 771. (Tr. 20, Ex. C) \n \n \nFrom May 2000, when Applicant was 18 years old, through October 2000 and \nagain in September 2006, he used marijuana. He did not use marijuana between 2001 \nand 2005. (Tr. 50) In September 2000, at the start of the college fall semester, Applicant \nwas charged with possession of marijuana by the university police. (Ex. B, Ex. 2) He \nand his roommate had been smoking marijuana in their college dorm room. The \nuniversity police discovered a small amount of marijuana in the room. (Tr. 33) Applicant \nwas found guilty, sentenced to one year probation, 150 hours of community service, \npaid $225, and his driver\u2019s license was restricted for six months. He was subject to \nrandom drug test for a year and was required to attend ten weeks of substance abuse \nmeetings. (Tr. 50-51, 73) He was required to attend four AA meeting, which he found to \nbe eye-opening. (Tr. 75)  \n \nIn November 2001, following the completion of probation, the case was \ndismissed. (Tr. 33, Ex. B) He was dismissed from the university and the next semester \nattended community college.  \n \n \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\n \nIn June 2001, Applicant\u2014then age 19\u2014was charged with, and later found guilty \nof, underage possession of alcohol. (Ex. 3) Applicant was at a state park fishing with his \nboss from a landscaping company. The park ranger saw a beer near Applicant. (Tr. 31) \nHis boss told the park ranger the beer was his. Applicant was given and passed a \nbreathalyzer test, but the ranger never-the-less ticketed Applicant. (Tr. 59) Applicant \npleaded no contest, paid a $30 fine, and performed 25 hours of community service at a \nhomeless shelter. Applicant juggled his community service commitment with his school \ncommitment and a part-time job. (Tr. 61)  \n \n \nIn January 2006, Applicant obtained a bachelors of science degree. (Tr. 37) In \nSeptember 2006, Applicant was again cited for possession of marijuana. (Ex. 4) \nApplicant was riding in a friend\u2019s car when his friend ran a stop sign. A search of the car \ndiscovered \u201ca piece of marijuana\u201d in a cigarette pack under Applicant\u2019s seat. (Tr. 69) \nApplicant acknowledge it was his and accepted responsibility. (Tr. 32) The day after \nreceiving the citation, Applicant disclosed the incident to his company\u2019s security officer. \n(Tr. 107) Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was restricted for six months and the disposition of \nhis case was deferred to December 2007, at which time it was dismissed. For a six-\nmonth period Applicant was subject to random urinalysis screenings.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges his decision to used marijuana after completing his \nsecurity clearance applicant was a \u201cstupid decision.\u201d (Tr. 49) Applicant has regretted his \ndecision \u201cevery day since.\u201d (Tr. 49)  \n \n \nIn February 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). Applicant listed the June 2001 underage possession \nof alcohol, but failed to list his September 2000 conviction for marijuana possession. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s father retired from the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel (05) after 22 \nyears. His father works for a defense contractor and holds a clearance. Applicant and \nhis father discussed listing the dismissed drug charges on Applicant\u2019s e-QIP. (Tr. 28, \n34) After talking with his father, Applicant did not list the arrest because it had been \nexpunged from his record. (Tr. 47) Applicant\u2019s father does not believe his son\u2019s was \ndeliberately lying in his response. In October 2006, when interviewed, Applicant \ndisclosed the September 2006 citation to the interviewer. The interviewer was unaware \nof the incident. (Tr. 35, 85)  \n \nIn response to Question 24 of the e-QIP, Applicant listed use of marijuana 10 \ntimes during 2000. Between his first use to his 2006 arrest, Applicant had use \nmarijuana approximately 10 times. He did not use marijuana between 2001 and 2005. \nApplicant stated that using marijuana is detrimental to growth and leads down the wrong \npath. (Tr. 39) In the past, he made stupid decisions by using it when it was offered. He \nno longer associates with people who use marijuana. (Tr. 42, 71) Applicant is willing to \nsubmit to random urine screens. (Tr. 29, 39)  \n \n\n \n \n \n4\nApplicant\u2019s father believes, regardless of the outcome of this proceeding, that the \nproceeding has had a \u201cprofound effect\u201d on his son. (Tr. 100) His son has learned the \ngravity of the situation, and the proceeding will continue to have an influence and effect \non his son.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \n\n \n \n \n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: Use of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nFrom May 2000 to October 2000, when Applicant was 18 years old, and again in \nSeptember 2006, he used marijuana. Between his first use to his 2006 arrest, Applicant \nhad use marijuana approximately 10 times. There was no use between 2001 and 2005. \nHis use, though infrequent, led to two citations for marijuana possession; once in 2000 \n\n \n \n \n6\nand again in 2006. His most recent use occurred after he had completed his e-QIP \nseeking a security clearance.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) drug use and AG \u00b6 25(c) purchase, apply. AG \u00b6 25(g) illegal drug use \nafter have being granted a security clearance does not apply because, even though he \nhad started the process to obtain a security clearance, he had not been granted a \nclearance.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n  \n \nApplicant last used marijuana two years ago. Applicant characterized his 2006 \nuse as a \u201cstupid decision,\u201d which he has regretted \u201cevery day since.\u201d Applicant does not \nintend to use illegal drugs in the future. Although he has not signed an affidavit stating \nhe would submit to drug testing and any drug use would result in the loss of his \nclearance, but did state he would submit to random urine tests.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana ten times over a six year period. His use was \ninfrequent. It has been more than two years since his last marijuana use. There are no \n\u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be \nbased \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by \nthe directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the \n\n \n \n \n7\n                                                          \nAppeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an \napplicant's last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing \nwas not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without \nany evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that \nperiod of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a \nfinding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d2 \n \nBecause of his abstention from drug use for two years, his recognition of the \nadverse impact drug abuse on his life, and the profound effect this procedure has had \non him, there is reasonable certitude that he will continue to abstain from drug use. \nApplicant did not attempt to hide his 2006 citation for illegal usage. The following day, \nhe reported the incident to his company\u2019s security office. Applicant did not used \nmarijuana from 2001 to 2005 and used it once in 2006. His marijuana use does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Because he will not \nuse illegal drugs in the future, confidence in his current reliability, trustworthiness and \ngood judgment with respect to drug use is restored. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies because he has stated he will not use illegal drugs in the \nfuture. He has demonstrated his intent not to abuse drugs in the future by the passage \nof two years since his last use.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(c) does not apply because abuse of prescription drugs was not a \nproblem. AG \u00b6 26(d) has limited applicability because did complete a ten week drug \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n\n \n \n \n8\nabuse treatment program, there has been no recurrence of abuse, but there is no \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct, which is \nconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \n \nApplicant used marijuana after having started process to obtain a security \nclearance shows poor or questionable judgment. Under AG \u00b6 16 conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying include AG \u00b6 16(d) \u201ccredible adverse \ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be \nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information.\u201d \n \nIn completing his e-QIP, Applicant listed his underage possession of alcohol \ncharge, but failed to list his possession of marijuana in the college dormitory. Failing to \nlist the 2000 possession of marijuana incident does not prove the Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose information about his illegal drug use. The Applicant has denied \nintentional falsification. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material \nfact in any written document or oral statement to the Government when applying for a \nsecurity clearance is a security concern. However, every inaccurate statement is not an \nintentional falsification. A falsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it \nis done knowingly and willfully.  \n \nApplicant was told the charge in this incident had been dismissed and his record \nexpunged. Applicant was unsure if he needed to report the 2000 incident. He discussed \nit with his father, an individual who had experience completing security clearance \napplications. After hearing his testimony, observing his demeanor, and evaluating all the \nevidence of record, I found his testimony credible on the falsification issue. I am \nsatisfied he did not intentionally falsify his e-QIP.  \n \nHaving previously found for Applicant as to his marijuana abuse, I find no \nadditional disqualifying or additional security concerns under the personal conduct \nguideline. I find for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 2.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \n\n \n \n \n9\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nApplicant used marijuana in 2000 and in 2006. AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying. AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious \ncrime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201c and AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted,\u201d apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was infrequent. He has a good employment record, \nacknowledged using marijuana was a bad decision and leads down the wrong road. \nApplicant\u2019s last use was two years ago and his use prior to that was eight years ago. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies.  \n \nApplicant is hard working, conscientious, and diligent young man. He accepts \nresponsibility, uses excellent judgment in dealing with sensitive personnel information. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) applies when there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement. AG \u00b6 32(d) applies.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. In 2000, as a college student \n\n \n \n \n10\nApplicant smoked marijuana in his dorm room and was found guilty of possessing \nmarijuana. Six years later, Applicant made a regrettable decision to again possess \nmarijuana, which he recognizes was a stupid decision. He no longer uses marijuana or \nassociates with those that do. At age 19 he was fishing in a state park and was cited for \npossession a beer while underage. His boss tried to tell the ranger it was his beer, but \nApplicant received the citation. Applicant is now 27, it is impossible for him to again be \ncharged with being underage and in possession of alcohol.  \n \nApplicant is hard working, diligent, and responsible. His friends and co-workers \npraise his character and dedication. When he completed his e-QIP he thought he did \nnot have to list his 2000 possession charge because it was dismissed and his record \nexpunged. He now knows better. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from \nhis drug involvement, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Criminal Conduct: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a \u2013 3.c: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He smoked marijuana, with varying frequency, between 1971 and January 1999, when he\ndecided to quit. His teenage son was killed by a drunk driver in 2000, and he has since dedicated\nmost of his free time to volunteering in crime, substance abuse and drunk-driving prevention\nprograms. He falsely denied drug use in a 1992 security clearance application, but admitted it in a\n1993 interview and has reported accurately on two subsequent applications. Applicant mitigated the\nsecurity concerns raised by his drug involvement, personal conduct and criminal conduct.  Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied to renew his security clearance on September 28, 2005, in conjunction with\nhis employment by a defense contractor as a government property manager. On March 30, 2007, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as\namended. The SOR detailed reasons, under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal\nConduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG),  why\n1\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended\nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter dated April 11, 2007, and\na supplemental letter dated April 30, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative\njudge. The case was then assigned to me on June 15, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on June\n19, 2007, and the hearing was held as scheduled on July 13, 2007. The Government offered five\nexhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, and admitted without\nobjection. Applicant testified, and offered six exhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A\nthrough F, and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr) on July 25,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the truth of some factual allegations set forth in the SOR pertaining to\ndrug involvement under AG H (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d). Those admissions are incorporated herein as\n\nGE 3 (Personnel Security Questionnaire (DD Form 398), dated July 1, 1992) at page 6 of 16.\n2\nId.\n3\nTr at 40-41.\n4\nGE 2 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated Sep. 25, 1997).\n5\nId., at 7.\n6\nGE 1 (e-QIP, dated Sep. 28, 2005) at 25-26.\n7\n3\nfindings of fact. He denied the drug involvement allegation in \u00b6 1.b, and the allegations concerning\npersonal conduct under AG E (\u00b6 2.a), and criminal activity under AG J (\u00b6 3.a). After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 53-year-old government property manager for a defense contractor. He has\nworked for that firm for 27 years, the last 25 of which he held a security clearance required to\nperform his job. He honorably served one five-year enlistment in the Air Force right after high\nschool. In 1975 he was a flying medic on board air-evacuation cargo planes during Operation Baby\nLift, saving the lives of Amer-Asian babies and young children from orphanages in Saigon. \nApplicant was married to his first wife from 1974 to 1994. His son was born in 1981, and\nhis daughter was born in 1984. He and his wife went through difficult periods for almost ten years\nprior to their 1994 divorce, and he underwent counseling to try to save the marriage. Ultimately, his\nwife simply left him and the children, and he became their single parent. They formed \u201ca team,\u201d and\nhe and his children became even closer and more interdependent. Applicant remarried for, as he\ntestified, \u201c11 months, 2 weeks, 3 days, and 6 hours,\u201dto a woman who also had children. The\nmarriage didn\u2019t work from the start. He described it as, \u201cdifficult at best,\u201d and after trying marriage\ncounseling, they decided to divorce. He married his current wife, a very impressive lady who served\nas his personal representative, in May 2004. \nApplicant testified that he thought he first obtained a security clearance in 1992. However,\nhis 1992 Personnel Security Questionnaire stated that he had held a clearance since 1982.  When he\n2\nfiled that Questionnaire, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 22.a, that inquired whether he had ever used\nnarcotics or marijuana.  He did so because he was a single parent by then, and was afraid that\n3\nadmitting drug use might cause him to lose his job.  During the ensuing interview in March 1993,\n4\nApplicant admitted to some casual, recreational use of marijuana, and experimentation with cocaine\na few times, during 1983 and 1984. His clearance was continued, and he again applied for renewal\nin 1997.  In response to question 27, inquiring about drug use during the last seven years, and\n5\nquestion 28, inquiring about drug use while holding a clearance, he responded \u201cYes,\u201d and reported\nusing marijuana three times during January 1993.  During the June 1998 follow-up interview, he\n6\nexplained that he was offered the marijuana by friends while at parties, was depressed by his pending\ndivorce, and shared some with them. His clearance was again continued. When he submitted his\ncurrently pending Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), he reported\nmarijuana use approximately 50 times from 1971 to 1999, including while he held a clearance.7\n\nTr at 32-38, 42-46.\n8\nTr at 18-19, 23, 25, 31-32.\n9\nAE C; AE D; Tr at 22-26, 34-36.\n10\nAE C; AE D; Tr at 24-26.\n11\nAE E.\n12\nAE F.\n13\n4\nApplicant explained his history of marijuana use at the hearing as being somewhat regular\nduring high school, and decreasingly frequent, except for that period in 1983 to 1984, ever since. He\nnever purchased marijuana, or used it by himself. His use was confined to smoking marijuana that\nwas being passed around at parties, and he felt peer pressure to participate. He last used marijuana\nat a party in January 1999, and made the conscious decision never to do so again because of the risk\nto his children should something happen to him, and to avoid setting a bad example for them. His\nuse of cocaine was limited to three occasions during the early 1980s. He no longer goes to any\nparties where drug use might occur, and would leave immediately if he accidentally did so.8\nApplicant was a professional ski instructor, and his son was a world class snow boarder. The\ntwo of them spent all the time they could together in the mountains. After graduation from high\nschool, his son took a year before starting college to work at an ice cream company and travel around\nthe U.S. and Canada snow boarding during his time off work. One evening in 2000, his son went out\nin a friend\u2019s car and was killed by a drunk driver. The accident was so bad, he was not allowed to\nsee his son\u2019s remains. This was such a severe mental and emotional trauma that he was relieved of\nmany of his responsibilities at work for 18 months. He became severely depressed and almost\nsuicidal.  \n9\nFive years ago, Applicant found an organization of victims of drunk drivers. He began\nvolunteering three or more times a week to go to courts, prisons, police stations, and schools\naddressing people who had been caught driving under the influence and others about the dangers and\nimpact of driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs. He and his main partner in this endeavor,\nherself a victim of a drunk driver, are well known, highly effective, and in high demand around the\ncounty and state for these services. These efforts, and his remarriage, have focused his life on helping\nothers. While still grieving, he is no longer depressed and has returned to full duties at work. His\ndeclaration that he will never again use marijuana or any illegal drug was sincere, credible, and\nconvincing.    \n10\nApplicant submitted the live testimony of his DUI Impact Panel partner and two letters of\nrecommendation, attesting to his integrity, honesty,  trustworthiness, and love for his country.  He\n11\nalso submitted a letter from one young man who had been greatly moved by his presentation.12\nFinally he submitted a copy of the security award he received from his company, recognizing his\nexceptional performance, diligence and awareness of security requirements.13\nPOLICIES            \n\nAG \u00b6 2.\n14\nId., at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n15\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n16\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n5\nThe revised AG that replaced Enclosure 2 of the Directive set forth adjudicative\nguidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) that may raise security concerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that\nmay reduce or negate security concerns. Applicable DCs and MCs must be considered in deciding\nwhether to grant, continue, deny or revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n14\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\n15\non the evidence contained in the record were drawn, and no inferences were grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n16\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n17\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n18\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n19\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nAG \u00b6 24.\n20\n6\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n17\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n18\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n19\nA person seeking access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship that\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section\n7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial security clearance\ndecision shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned,\u201d so the decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs set forth in the Directive, every recommended personnel security decision must be a fair\nand impartial overall common sense decision based on all available evidence, both favorable and\n unfavorable.  The decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant or continuance\nof a security clearance or access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.  \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement\n\u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d20\nApplicant admitted using cocaine three times during the early 1980s and marijuana while in high\nschool, regularly for about six months around 1983, and once or twice a year thereafter until January\n\nDrug abuse is defined as the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\n21\napproved medical direction. Regulation, Appendix 8, Guideline H \u00b6 24(b).\nRegulation, Appendix 8, Guideline E \u00b6 15.\n22\n7\n1999, when he stopped for good. He never tested positive for any drug use, and the only reason it\nis known is because he honestly admitted it in connection with multiple security clearance renewal\napplications since 1993. He denied ever purchasing or owning marijuana or other drugs, and he\nmerely shared in using them when being passed around at parties. There is no evidence to the\ncontrary. He also admitted that some of his marijuana use occurred while he held a security\nclearance. The Government has established the truth of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. The Government\ndid not present any evidence to establish the truth of SOR \u00b6 1.b, which Applicant denied.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises security concerns under two drug involvement disqualifying\nconditions (DI DC). DI DC 25(a) (\u201cany drug abuse\u201d)  and DI DC 25(g) (\u201cany illegal drug use after\n21\nbeing granted a security clearance\u201d) apply to his admitted use of marijuana with varying frequency\nfrom 1971 to January 1999, and use of cocaine a few times during the early 1980s. Although\nApplicant did not remember having a clearance before 1992, he stated on the application he\nsubmitted that year that he had held a clearance since 1982. No other DI DC applies.\nAfter considering all of the possible drug involvement mitigating conditions (DI MC), two\nof them squarely apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. DI MC 26(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d) does apply to\nmitigate drug involvement security concerns. The last incident took place more than 8 years ago, and\nthe last drug use of any frequency was some 24 years ago. He no longer attends parties where drugs\nmight be present, and is fully engaged in law-enforcement programs to deter and prevent substance\nabuse after his son\u2019s tragic death. His prior drug use, even when holding a clearance, is highly\nunlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment under his\npresent circumstances.\nApplicant has disassociated himself from drug-using associates and contacts, now avoids the\nenvironment where drugs were used, has been abstinent for more than eight years, and compellingly\ndemonstrated his intent not to abuse drugs in the future during his testimony, all of which further\nmitigate any security concerns under DI MC 26(b). DI MC 26(c) involving prescription drugs, and\nDI MC 26(d) concerning rehabilitation and treatment programs do not apply.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d22\nAfter considering all of the personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC), only PC DC\n16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\n\n8\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d) applies to Applicant\u2019s conduct.\nHe falsified his answer concerning prior drug use on his 1992 Personnel Security Questionnaire, and\ndid so because he thought answering truthfully might endanger his job. He subsequently and honestly\nadmitted his drug use in his 1993 and 1998 interviews, and on his 1997 and 2005 clearance\napplications. No other PC DC applies.\nHaving considered all of the personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC), several apply.\nPC MC 17(a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment,\nor falsification before being confronted with the facts\u201d) does not apply. His 1993 admission to the\ndrug use came during an interview when, although not confronted with any known facts, he was\nbeing questioned about the truthfulness of his denial. This does not rise to the level of voluntary\ncorrection and disclosure required by Appeal Board precedent under the former adjudicative\nguidelines which, though not necessarily binding for interpretation of the reworded PC MC, guides\nthis decision. Applicant never asserted that concealment of his drug use was caused by improper\nadvice or legal counsel, so PC MC 17(b), addressing such situations, is inapplicable. \nPC MC 17(c) (\u201cthe offense was so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does apply to mitigate\nApplicant\u2019s conduct. This falsification was more than 15 years ago, and he has fully and freely\ndisclosed the omitted information on two subsequent clearance applications, during two security\ninterviews, and at the hearing itself. Taken together, this history establishes that recurrence is\nunlikely, and the conduct casts no doubt on his present judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. The\nfalsification was known 24 years ago. He has maintained a clearance ever since, has had no security\nviolations, and in fact received formal recognition for his security performance. \nPC MC 17(d) (\u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors\nthat caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur\u201d) also applies in partial mitigation.  Applicant first admitted the falsification back in 1993,\nand continues to do so. He has taken positive steps to eliminate his drug involvement that put his job\nor security clearance at risk and caused him to answer falsely in the first place. He has fully revealed\nhis past involvement, and has an extended period of demonstrated integrity.\nPC MC 17(e) (\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d) also mitigates the security concerns here.  He has been\nabstinent for more than eight years. He fully intends to continue this lifestyle, which reduces or\neliminates his vulnerability. He did not eliminate drug involvement in response to any threat to his\njob or clearance, but for family and personal reasons that have been heavily reinforced by events\nsince then.\nPC MC 17(f) (\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability\u201d) does not apply, since Applicant admitted the falsification. PC MC 17(g)(\u201cassociation\nwith persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations\u201d) would apply to mitigate any security concerns under PC DC 16(g), which were not\nalleged in this case, but has no mitigating effect on concerns raised under PC DC 16(a).\n\nAG \u00b6 30.\n23\n9\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations.\u201d  The only crime alleged in the SOR was the falsification of the 1992 Personnel\n23\nSecurity Questionnaire discussed above under AG E. His drug use, while admittedly illegal, was not\nalleged as a security concern. For the reasons discussed above under AG H, the drug use does not\nraise any independent security concerns under AG J.\nCriminal conduct disqualifying condition (CC DC) 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses\u201d) and CC DC 31 (c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted\u201d) both apply to raise\npotential security concerns about Applicant\u2019s falsification as alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a. Although known\nfor 24 years and never pursued as a crime, falsification on a clearance application can be prosecuted\nas a felony and is especially significant in determining worthiness to hold a clearance. No other CC\nDC applies.\nCriminal conduct mitigating condition (CC MC) 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d) does\napply to mitigate this falsification for the same reasons discussed above concerning PC MC 17(c).\nApplicant also established CC MC 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including\nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution,\njob training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement\u201d). He has not falsified his subsequent security clearance submissions for 15 years, and\nhas an excellent employment record, particularly in the area of security. He has engaged in highly\nconstructive community involvement for more than five years, directly supporting law enforcement\nefforts and combating substance abuse. Applicant did not assert, and the record would not support\nany other CC MC.  \nWhole Person Analysis \nI have considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability\nin protecting our national interests. His drug involvement consisted of three experimental uses of\ncocaine, and marijuana use, primarily during and before the early 1980s. Between 1984 and January\n1999, he used marijuana once or twice a year, on average, when it was being passed around at a party\nand he felt peer pressure to participate. He knew what he was doing was wrong, and decided to\nabstain from any drug use in January 1999 out of concern for his then 18 and 15-year-old children.\nHe was devastated when his son was killed in 2000 by a drunk driver. He has volunteered\nextensively for the past five years with law enforcement and other crime prevention programs against\nsubstance abuse and drunk driving. He is now in a happy, healthy and stable marriage. He has\nadmitted his conduct in connection with security clearance renewals since 1993. His 1992\nfalsification was a long ago, has not been repeated, and is unlikely to recur. Accordingly, Applicant\n\n10\nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement, personal conduct, and criminal\nconduct. It is clearly in the interest of national security to continue his access to classified material.\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \n            Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:                               FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nMelvin A. Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He disclosed some, but not all, of his financial\nproblems on his security-clearance application because he was genuinely unaware of the extent of\nhis financial problems. Although he and his spouse are making some progress in resolving the\nfinancial problems, it is likely that the financial problems will continue or recur because Applicant\nhas little if any involvement in managing the family finances. His continued hands-off approach to\nhis finances indicates a lack of good judgment. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nThis is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on May 25, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it\ndetails the factual basis for the action. The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations based on a history of financial problems and Guideline E for personal conduct based\non falsification of a security-clearance application.  \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nApplicant replied to the SOR on July 23, 2007, and requested a hearing. The hearing took\nplace on November 14, 2007, and the transcript was received on November 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges seven delinquent debts ranging from $644 to $10,271\nfor about $30,336 in total, which  Applicant admits. He also admits that a real estate mortgage was\nforeclosed upon in 2001. He denies the allegations that he made deliberately false statements when\nanswering two questions about his financial delinquencies on a security-clearance application. Based\non the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old applications engineer. He has worked for his current employer\nsince August 1997. His current annual salary is about $87,000. He appears to have a good\nemployment record (Exhibit G). He is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to\nhim by the Defense Department.   \nFrom June 1986 to August 1997, Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy. He\nworked as an electronics technician. He held a security clearance at the secret and top-secret levels\nwhile in the Navy. Upon his discharge, his character of service was described as honorable.\nApplicant has been married since 1991. He and his wife have a 12-year-old son who attends\npublic school. Applicant\u2019s wife works as a membership director for a local chamber of commerce.\n\n3\nHer current salary is about $37,000. She was unemployed or underemployed for about six months\nduring 2000-2001, and this unemployment contributed to their financial problems.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. It is established by the credit reports containing\nadverse financial information (Exhibits 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8). In Applicant\u2019s household, his wife has\nprimary responsibility for managing the family finances and paying the bills. This arrangement is\nconvenient for Applicant because he travels for business on a regular basis. Applicant was totally\ndisengaged from the family finances until he was confronted with the adverse information during\nthe background investigation. His wife did not tell him about their financial problems because she\nwas scared, uncertain how to handle the situation, and did not want to cause conflict in their marriage\n(R. 39\u201342). Although he is now asking more questions of his wife, and he may go online to check\ntheir account, his wife continues to have primary responsibility for their finances. Indeed, in response\nto cross-examination from department counsel, he explained that he does not look at his paycheck\nand that his wife \u201cdoes it all\u201d (R. 67).   \nHe completed a security-clearance application in June 2005  (Exhibit 1). When signing his\napplication, he certified that his statements were true, complete, and correct to the best on his\nknowledge and belief and were made in good faith, and he acknowledged that a knowing and willful\nfalse statement could be punished under federal law. In particular, he answered the following\nquestions about his financial record as follows:\n\u2022\nQuestion 34\u2013asking if in the last seven years his wages were garnished for any reason, to\nwhich he replied \u201cyes\u201d and noted a garnishment in 2004 by a state tax authority.\n\u2022\nQuestion 38\u2013asking if in the last seven years he had been over 180-days delinquent on any\ndebts, to which he replied \u201cno.\u201d\n\u2022\nQuestion 39\u2013asking if he was currently over 90-days delinquent on any debts, to which he\nreplied \u201cyes\u201d and noted a credit card account with a past-due balance of $4,861.\nSometime thereafter, he met with an investigator. Other than what he disclosed on his\nsecurity-clearance application, he did not know about his adverse financial condition until he was\nshown a credit report during the interview. He was unaware because his spouse handled all aspects\nof their finances and she did not tell him about the delinquent accounts or the foreclosure on a rental\nproperty located in another state. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a medical collection account for $644. Applicant believes this\naccount was paid when he and his wife paid off other medical collection accounts, and those\npayments are reflected in the credit reports. In October 2007, Applicant sent a letter to a credit\nservice requesting that the account be described as paid in full (Exhibit F).\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is a collection account based on a credit card account for $4,861. It\nis the credit card account Applicant disclosed in his security-clearance application. This account was\nsettled in full in March 2007 for $2,996 (Exhibit E).\nThe other five delinquent accounts in the SOR remain unpaid. Applicant and his wife have\nbeen advised to not pay these debts because they are not enforceable based on the state\u2019s statute of\nlimitations. In October 2007, Applicant and his wife started working with a credit education\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

They have sent dispute letters to the three major\ncredit reporting agencies disputing several accounts (Exhibits B, C, and D).  \nApplicant was unaware of the foreclosure on the rental property in 2001. It happened during\nhis wife\u2019s period of unemployment and underemployment that took place concurrent  with the tenant\nmoving out of the property. As far and he and his wife know, they do not owe a deficiency balance.\nTheir belief is consistent with a credit report showing a zero balance on this account (Exhibit 2).  \nApplicant is current with the monthly rent payment. He has no car payments. Neither he nor\nhis wife has an active credit card account. They manage their money, to include paying bills, from\na joint bank account. They operate on a cash basis and typically pay bills online. They currently have\nabout $5,000 in their joint back account as they are working on establishing an emergency fund.\nApplicant has about $10,000 in investments via his employment. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 10\u201312 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n14\n Revised Guidelines at p. 10.\n15\n5\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and credible adverse\n14\ninformation that may not be enough to support action under any other guideline. In particular, a\nsecurity concern may arise due to \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d15\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant made false statements when providing answers to Questions\n38 and 39 concerning financial delinquencies. Applicant contends his answers were not deliberately\nfalse because he was unaware of the full extent of his financial problems when he completed the\napplication. Applicant\u2019s explanation is credible, as it is corroborated by his wife who acknowledged\nthat she kept their financial problems a secret. She was able to keep the secret because Applicant was\ntotally disengaged from managing the family finances and that duty fell to his spouse. In addition,\nApplicant did disclose some adverse financial information in response to two questions. His\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n16\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n17\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n18\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n19\n6\ndisclosures tend to undermine or undercut the case that he was trying to hide his adverse financial\nhistory when he completed the security-clearance application. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided\nfor Applicant. \n2.\nThe Financial Considerations Security Concern\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n16\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n17\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHis history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability to satisfy debts18\nand a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record\n19\nevidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. Not counting the\nforeclosure, Applicant admits to about $30,000 in delinquent debt, most of which is unpaid.  \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and three deserve\ndiscussion. First, MC 2\u2014conditions largely beyond a person\u2019s control\u2014does not apply. First, his\nspouse\u2019s relatively brief period of unemployment several years ago and her actions in keeping their\nfinancial problems a secret were unexpected circumstances largely beyond his control. The MC does\nnot apply, however, because Applicant\u2019s  disengagement from his family\u2019s finances is not reasonable\nconduct under the circumstances. Once  he was confronted with the adverse credit report during the\nbackground investigation, Applicant should have become more involved in managing the finances,\nbut that is not the case.  \nSecond, MC 3\u2014the person has received or is receiving counseling and/or there are clear\nsigns that the problem is resolved or is under control\u2014applies somewhat. Applicant and his wife\nhave retained the services of a credit education company who is assisting them. The extent of the\nfinancial counseling is unclear. Although delinquent debts still exist, Applicant and his wife no\nlonger use credit cards and they are not incurring new delinquent debt. And to that extent, their\ncurrent financial situation is under control.  \nThird, the most pertinent mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to initiate\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Applicant has taken some\npositive steps to resolve the delinquent indebtedness by: (1) settling one account; (2) disputing\n\n7\nanother account as paid; and (3) retaining the services of the credit education company. These\ncircumstances are sufficient to qualify for some credit, but not full credit, in mitigation. \nThis case presents both disqualifying and mitigating information, which requires thoughtful\nbalancing. Applicant is 39 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about his\nfinances and money-management practices. He and his wife have made some progress in resolving\ntheir outstanding debts. But of concern here is Applicant\u2019s lack of involvement in managing or\noverseeing his finances. He was totally disengaged until confronted with the credit report during the\nbackground investigation. Since then he has had limited involvement. It appears his spouse is still\nresponsible for their finances. Their past financial history suggests that they were not on the same\nsheet of music. Although it was perfectly reasonable for Applicant to trust his spouse to keep him\ninformed of their financial situation\u2014once confronted with the adverse information\u2014Applicant\nshould have taken a more proactive and hands-on approach. It is likely that the financial problems\nwill continue or recur because Applicant has little if any involvement in managing the family\nfinances. And more important, his continued hands-off approach to his finances indicates a lack of\ngood judgment that is necessary to obtain access to classified information. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person\nconcept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant.
