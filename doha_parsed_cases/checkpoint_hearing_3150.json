Upon examination of her credit reports, it was found that she had \nfive delinquent accounts. These delinquent debts total about $31,375. They are all \nindividual accounts, although Applicant noted that she took out the credit cards for her \nparents, who have poor credit. There is no documentation showing she has received or \nreceiving financial counseling. Little more is known about her financial situation or her \nmethodology for addressing her obligations. The accounts at issue are: \n1.a \u2013 Approximately $10,433 - Applicant admitted responsibility for this debt, but \nnoted that she recently entered into a payment plan with the lender. While the plan was \nnot introduced, she provided a \u2018post-dated receipt\u2019 indicating the lender was to process \na $20 payment on December 1, 2021. No documentary evidence of such a transaction \nwas provided with her February 9, 2022, FORM Response. Moreover, Applicant \nstressed that her credit report lists this account as \u201ccharged off,\u201d and it no longer \nappears as an outstanding debt. A charged-off account, however, means a lender wrote \nthe account off as a loss and closed it to future charges.

(SOR \nResponse) No additional insight into the case was offered and there is no indication \nwhether the matter has been appealed or reinstituted. \n1.e \u2013 Approximately $436 - In her response to the FORM, Applicant wrote that \nthis debt was paid and that proof of satisfaction was attached to the FORM Response. \nWhile evidence was not included there, she did provide documentation reflecting the \nbalance was settled in September 2021. (SOR Response) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence, and transcends \nduty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in those \ngranted such access. Decisions necessarily include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions \nshall be in terms of the national interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 states that the security concern under this guideline \nis that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad acquired multiple delinquent debts, amounting to about $31,375. This is sufficient to \ninvoke financial considerations disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts, and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nUnder these facts, four conditions could mitigate related security concerns: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-\nprofit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or under control; and  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant provided no information showing that her acquisition of this delinquent \ndebt was the result of conditions beyond her control, or that she acted responsibly \nunder such extraordinary conditions. This obviates application of AG \u00b6 20(b). There is \nno indication that she has received or is receiving financial counseling, or that she has \nformally disputed any of the debts at issue. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. While \nshe provided documentary evidence showing the smallest debt for $436 was \naddressed, there is scant documentation reflecting that the remaining delinquent debt of \nover $30,000 is being addressed, is now under control, or is subject to a plan to resolve \nall her delinquent accounts. Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n         Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n    Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old part-time instructor who has worked in the same \nposition since 2014. She has spent many years furthering her education. She has \nearned both B.A. and M.A. degrees. She is currently pursuing a doctoral degree. As a \nresult, she has about $266,000 in deferred student loans. Applicant resides with her \nparents. She is single and has no children. Currently, Applicant is sponsoring an alien \nfrom Syria to whom she is engaged. At issue are five delinquent debts amounting to \napproximately $31,375, only one of which was noted on her SCA. \nBased on her credit reports, the Government showed that Applicant had the five \ndelinquent debts. She only admitted responsibility for one of those delinquent accounts. \nWhile she provided documentation clearly showing the smallest debt at issue ($436) \nhas been satisfied, she offered scant documentation to show she is actively working \nand making progress on the remaining debts, or has adopted a reasonable and \ncomprehensive strategy for addressing her delinquent accounts. Due to this lack of \ndocumentation, the financial considerations security concern remains unmitigated. \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e \nFor Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

(HX II.) On the same date, Department Counsel amended the SOR by adding \none additional allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.x). Applicant answered the amendment on January \n20, 2022.  \nScheduling of the hearing was delayed by COVID-19. The case was assigned to \nme on September 6, 2022. On September 13, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be conducted by \nvideo teleconference on October 3, 2022. I issued a case management order on \nSeptember 27, 2022, requiring the parties to provide me and each other with copies of all \nexhibits they intended to submit at the hearing. (HX III.) \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted AX A through X, \nwhich were admitted without objection. Department Counsel did not receive AX B, AX C, \nAX D, and AX G through AG X before the hearing, because Applicant had not sent them \nto him as required by the case management order. After Applicant testified, I continued \nthe hearing until October 6, 2022, to enable Department Counsel to review AX B, AX C, \nAX D, and AX G through AG X before cross-examining her. The hearing resumed and \nwas completed on October 6, 2022. I kept the record open until October 21, 2022, to \nenable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. She timely submitted AX Y \nthrough AX FF, which were admitted with comments from Department Counsel but \nwithout objection. (HX IV.) DOHA received the transcript of the first day of the hearing on \nOctober 17, 2022 (Tr-1) and the transcript of the second day of the hearing (Tr-2) on \nOctober 19, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d-1.x. She denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Her admissions incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old electrical shop supervisor employed by a defense \ncontractor. She graduated from high school in May 1998. She served on active duty in \nthe U.S. Navy from July 1998 to February 2003 and received an honorable discharge. \nShe worked for federal contractors from July 2008 until she was hired by her current \nemployer in December 2018. She received a security clearance from another federal \nagency in July 2011. \nApplicant married in December 2016.

(Tr-1 at 22.) She and her current \nhusband have two-year-old twins. The twins were in intensive care for about three weeks \nafter their birth. (Tr-1 at 25.) \nApplicant\u2019s husband is a deputy sheriff. He previously was an independent truck \nowner and driver. He currently earns about $54,000 annually. As an independent owner \nand operator, his earnings varied. In 2019 and 2020, his gross income was about \n$150,000. (Tr. 29.) He stopped driving in order to spend more time with his family. He is \nattempting to sell his truck in order to pay off some of their debts. (Tr. 18.) \nAbout four years ago, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law was seriously injured in a car \naccident when he had a stroke while he was driving. Applicant\u2019s husband stopped working \nfor about three months to take care of his father. Applicant testified that this reduction in \nfamily income caused her to fall behind on her student-loan payments. (Tr-1 at 31-33.) \nThe SOR alleges 24 delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from September \n2020, April 2021, December 2021, and September 2022 (GX 2; GX 3; GX 4; GX 7.) The \nevidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.v, and 1.w: delinquent student loans placed for collection of \n$48,716; $12,179; and $7,878. These loans were opened in December 2006 and were \ndelinquent as of December 2018. On October 13, 2021, after Applicant received the SOR, \nshe applied for a direct consolidation loan and an income-driven payment plan. As of the \ndate of the hearing, her student loans had been consolidated and were reflected as \ncurrent. She has not begun making payments because of the COVID deferment. (GX 7 \nat 8; Tr-1 at 35-37.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-card account placed for collection of $6,852. A judgment for \nthis debt was entered against Applicant in February 2021. (GX 5 at 3.) On October 14, \n2021, Applicant and the creditor agreed that she would make an initial payment of $702 \nand monthly $150 payments until the debt is paid in full. (SOR Answer; AX E; AX F.) She \nhas made the required payments for every month through January 2022. (AX L through \nY; AX EE.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-card account placed for collection of $1,401. Applicant \ndenied this debt and asserted that it was due to identity theft. She testified that after her \ndispute of the debt was unsuccessful, she used funds from a federal income tax refund \nto pay the debt in full. (AX AA; Tr-1 at 42.) However, she did not produce any documents \nshowing that the debt was paid. (AX Y.) An applicant who claims that a debt has been \nresolved is expected to present documentary evidence supporting the claim. See ISCR \nCase No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.j, and 1.u: credit-card accounts placed for collection of \n$835, $21, $183, and $834. Applicant testified that she paid these debts in October 2021. \n(Tr-1 at 44.) She did not provide any documentation of payment. (Tr-1 at 44-45.) The \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.u appear to be the same account.

This debt is \nnot resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k-1.t: medical debts placed for collection of a total \nof $2,423: On October 13, 2021, Applicant paid $1,144 to a collection agency for \nnumerous unspecified medical debts. (AX G.) On the same date, she paid $960 to another \ncollection agency for three medical debts. (AX H.) She paid the specific debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.k, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.t on October 14, 2021. (GX 2 at 3; Tr-1 at 45-46.) She \npaid the specific debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.s on October 19, 2021. (AX A.) She has made \nregular $165 payments to a medical collection agency handling the other medical debts \nfor every month from October 13, 2021, through September 15, 2022. (AX L through AX \nW; AX EE.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.x: medical debt reduced to judgment for $1,547. A default judgment \nfor $1,547 was entered against Applicant in May 2021 for this debt, which was for medical \ncare for Applicant\u2019s twins. It is not resolved. \nApplicant testified that she incurred numerous medical bills due to her high blood \npressure and an irregular heartbeat, but cardiologists successfully treated her, and her \nsymptoms are now controlled by medication. For a while, she had a health savings \naccount with a high deductible. After her twins were born and spent three weeks in \nintensive care, she incurred additional medical expenses. Her medical insurance carrier \nfor the expenses related to her childbirth has not yet reimbursed her. (Tr-1 at 47-48.) She \nhas about $2,000 in a health savings plan with a former employer, but she admitted that \nshe had not contacted the former employer about transferring the funds. (Tr-1 at 54-55.) \nApplicant owes about $19,584 for hospital care that her insurance carrier has \ndeclined to cover. (AX X; Tr. 56-60.) Because this debt is not alleged in the SOR, it may \nnot be an independent basis for revoking her security clearance. However, it may be \nconsidered to assess her credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline \nis applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; \nto consider whether she has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-\nperson analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations \nomitted). I have considered this debt for these limited purposes. \nApplicant admitted at the hearing that she did not take her medical bills seriously, \nbelieving that she could pay them when she could afford it. After she submitted her SCA \nand was interviewed by a security investigator, she began focusing on resolving her \ndebts. (Tr-1 at 18.) She sought financial advice from her credit union about a year ago \nand she now has a written budget. (Tr-1 at 67.)

(AX CC.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent, numerous, and were \nnot incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant encountered several conditions \nlargely beyond her control. She suffered medical conditions requiring care from a \ncardiologist and a regimen of medications. The birth of her twins triggered substantial \nmedical expenses. She changed jobs in December 2018, which complicated her access \nto her health savings account with a former employer. Her husband\u2019s change of jobs \ncaused a significant reduction in family income. Her husband was unemployed for several \nmonths while caring for his father after a serious automobile accident. \nHowever, Applicant has not acted responsibly. She attributed her delinquent \nstudent loans to her husband\u2019s loss of income while caring for his father, but she did not \ntake action to rehabilitate her student loans until she received the SOR and realized that \nher security clearance was in jeopardy. She admitted at the hearing that she was not \nconcerned about her mounting medical debts until she learned that her debts could be an \nimpediment to retaining her security clearance. She estimated that she had significant \nfunds in her health savings plan with her former employer, but she had not taken any \naction to obtain those funds as of the date of the hearing. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant sought and received financial advice \nfrom her credit union and began using a written budget, but her financial problems are \nnot yet under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Good faith means acting in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. \n99-0201 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).

ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2018). \nAlthough Applicant has consolidated the delinquent student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.v and 1.w and payments are deferred, the loans were delinquent before she \nconsolidated them and before the COVID deferments began. She did not begin to \naddress her delinquent debts until she received the SOR. Accordingly, there is a concern \nthat Applicant will not make timely payments on her student loans when collections are \nresumed.  \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant disputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nand 1.g, but she submitted no evidence of the basis for her disputes, and neither was \nresolved in her favor. \nThe evidence indicates that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.u are the same \ndebt. When the same conduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under the same \nguideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in the applicant\u2019s favor. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). \nAccordingly, I have resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Navy and has held a security \nclearance for many years. She was candid and sincere at the hearing. She is highly \nregarded by her fellow workers and a former supervisor. She has made progress in her \nefforts to regain financial stability, but her efforts have been motivated mostly by self-\ninterest rather than a sense of duty, triggered after she received the SOR.

(Item 1) She is 56 years \nold, and was divorced in 2008. She has two adult children. Applicant attended college \ncourses in 1983 and 1984, but she did not obtain a degree. She reports no military \nservice. She completed a security clearance application on October 15, 2020. (Item 2) \nShe has held a security clearance for about 35 years. (Item 1) Applicant\u2019s work history \nwith Federal employment dates back to 1986. \nFinancial \nApplicant attributed her delinquent medical debts, incurred between 2013 and \n2020, to unemployment, underemployment, lack of health insurance, and single \nparenthood. In August 2013, she lost employment and medical insurance due to the \nend of a contract. Specifically, she was employed from 2014 to April 2020 in low-paying \njobs. She worked part time between 2017 through 2020 due to medical issues. She was \nfurloughed due to COVID in 2020. (Item 2) \nApplicant spent time as an in-patient and ER patient at a hospital for major \nmedical issues such as bowel obstruction, migraines, and irritable bowel syndrome \n(IBS). She tried not to go to the hospital and visit urgent care facilities to lessen costs \nbut that was not always possible. (Item 1) However, she maintained all other financial \nresponsibilities. (Item 3) Each account listed in the credit bureau report (Item 3) reflects \n\u201cpays as agreed.\u201d There were no delinquent debts except the medical accounts. \nApplicant disclosed in her 2020 security clearance application that she had no \nmedical insurance since August 31, 2013, nor could she afford health insurance. She \nhad multiple hospital stays and multiple ER visits due to migraines which she could not \npay. She stated that she had made sporadic payments whenever she could. \nIn her response to the FORM, Applicant revealed that she has been making \npayments of $100 each month to the hospital, and in January 2022, will make bi\u00ad\nmonthly payments. She produced the latest two receipts. (Item 5) She has raised $500 \nfrom a Go-Fund me page and has received some money from family and friends. In the \ninterim she paid two credit cards and those monthly payments will now go to the \nmedical accounts. She is also selling items to raise money to pay her medical debts. \n(Item 5). \nApplicant consulted with two debt consolidation companies, one of whom \nspecializes in medical debt, but was told the medical debt was more than 50% of her \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ntotal debt and the other company, AMI, could not help because the medical account \nholder offered her 60% off the total loan amount. She plans to get a loan for the \nremainder $24,000 she owes to the hospital. She continues to work toward paying the \nmedical debts. She noted that she has remained loyal to the Government and suffered \nPTSD from the attack in the building where she worked in 2001. \nApplicant has not ignored her medical debts and with the start of new \nemployment with a higher salary, she now has health insurance. As noted above she \ncan take a loan for $24,000 (one- time payment \u2013 60% reduction in the original debt). \nShe investigated this loan and knows that she can afford the monthly payments. The \nother option offered to the Applicant is making monthly payments on the entire debt of \n$59,000. \nApplicant takes responsibility for the medical payments. She attempted to resolve \nthe medical debts prior to the security clearance process. She disclosed her medical \nfinancial issues. Applicant tried to obtain the services of a debt consolidation company. \nShe has taken concrete steps to resolve her medical delinquent accounts and provided \ndocumentation concerning some payments and her plan. \n Policies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \nand 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted, and her credit reports confirm, that she is responsible for the \ndelinquent medical debts that started in 2013 when she lost her health insurance due to \nunemployment. Applicant has no other debts. Her credit report (Item 3) shows that \nevery account is paid as agreed. She supported her children as a single parent and paid \nher bills. \nBased on the evidence produced by Applicant, it is concluded she made a \nsufficient good-faith effort to resolve her medical debts. She is beginning a meaningful \ntrack record of financial responsibility. She has met her burden under some of the \nmitigating conditions, including situations beyond her control, adhering to a good-faith \neffort to repay the medical debts, and it is unlikely that this will recur. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

On September 15, 2021, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines F and E. (Item 1.)

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of these apply. Applicant has significant past-due indebtedness that she has \nyet to address. Financial Considerations is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of her SCA, the following \ndisqualifying condition could apply: \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to Section 26 on her October 2019 SCA.. Therefore, AG \n\u00b6 16(a) is established. \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 17 (a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17 (b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment \nwas caused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \nAG \u00b6 17 (c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17 (d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying her SCA; but she has offered nothing as to \nher character, such as letters of support from those who know Applicant, to support her \naverment. After considering the mitigating conditions outlined above, none of them apply. \nPersonal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant deliberately falsified her SCA, \nand she has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her financial indebtedness. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: Against Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information.

DOHA sent the FORM to Applicant on the same day, and \nhe received it on July 27, 2022. He was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not respond \nto the FORM. The SOR and the Answer (Items 1S and 1A, respectively) are the pleadings \nin the case. Items 2 through 6 are admitted without objection. The case was assigned to \nme on October 3, 2022. \nOn November 8, 2022, I emailed Department Counsel and Applicant that \nintended to take administrative notice of the following August 16, 2022 press release by \nthe U.S. Department of Education: Education Department Approves $3.9 Billion Group \nDischarge for 208,000 Borrowers Who Attended [Applicant\u2019s college or \u201cthe College\u201d]. \nhttps://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-approves-39-billion-\ngroup-discharge-208000-borrowers-who-attended-itt-technical-institute. The parties had \nuntil close of business November 15, 2022, to object. There were no objections. This \npress release is marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1 and is admitted. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 34 years old, has never married, and has no children. He attended \ncollege from March 2011 to March 2013, when he earned his Associate\u2019s degree. He \nearned his Master\u2019s degree from the same college in March 2015. He was unemployed \nfrom March 2004 until August 2014. He also listed \u201cIn process with [a company]\u201d during \nthat period. Neither his SCA nor his Personal Subject Interview (PSI) explained what that \nmeant. Since September 2016, he has worked for a defense contractor. (Items 2 and 3.) \nThe SOR alleged 13 student loans that are in collections totaling $77,113. (Item \n1S.) Applicant admitted all allegations. (Item 1A.) The creditors for all 13 loans are \u201cDEPT \nOF ED/NE,\u201d \u201cDP OF EDUC,\u201d or \u201cUS DEPARTMENT OF EDU,\u201d respectively. (Items 4, 5, \nand 6.) The amounts past due in the eldest credit report (Item 4, January 29, 2020) do \nnot match any of the amounts due in the two most recent credit reports. (Items 5 (February \n22, 2021) and 6 (June 22, 2022)). Nor do the account numbers in the eldest report match \nthe numbers in the two most recent reports. (Items 4, 5, and 6.) Therefore, the eldest \nreport (Item 4) is given less weight. \nThe SOR dollar amounts and account numbers for each debt came from the \nFebruary 22, 2021 credit report. (Item 5.) Those dollar amounts match the latest credit \nreport dollar amounts. (Item 6.) The debts were incurred in approximately the 2013 to \n2015 timeframe. (Items 5 and 6.) Because the 13 debts have the same creditor, the same \nrespective amounts due, and the same reporting status, they do not warrant separate \ndiscussions. \n2 \nI \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHE 1 states in pertinent part the following: \nToday the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced \nthat it will discharge all remaining federal student loans that borrowers \nreceived to attend the College from January 1, 2005 through its closure in \nSeptember 2016. . . .These borrowers will have the federal loans they \nreceived to attend the College discharged without any additional action on \ntheir part. . . . [The investigation showed that] The College engaged in \nwidespread and pervasive misrepresentations related to the ability of \nstudents get a job or transfer credits. . . . The College defrauded hundreds \nof thousands of students. . . .  \nApplicant received his Associate\u2019s degree in March 2013 and his Master\u2019s degree \nin March 2015. Therefore, he attended the College during the dates covered by the \nDepartment\u2019s loan discharge.  \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent \nstudent loans in his SCA. The SCA did not, in fact, disclose those loans. (Item 2.) \nApplicant admitted that allegation. (Item 1A.) The subject of his student loans and his \nfailure to disclose them were discussed in his PSI: \nSubject was advised during his initial contact to schedule his\ninterview, to bring any documentation pertaining to his financial accounts.\nSubject was asked if he was currently delinquent or had any accounts that\nwere currently collections or charged off. Subject disclosed that he had\nlooked at his student loans yesterday and that they were in defaulted [sic]\nand he knew they were delinquent. Subject knew he had to pay them but\nafter graduation he tried to start payments but he was not able to contact\nthe creditor. Shortly after Subject graduated [the college] was closed and\nSubject was given points of contact that would not return his calls. After\nthree months of repeated attempts to contact the creditor Subject gave up\ntrying to pay. Subject is financially responsible and he is willing and able to\nmake the payments, he became frustrated trying to locate the creditor.\nSubject did not list the accounts on the questionnaire because he did not\nhave all the information for the accounts, he did not intentionally omit the\ninformation. (Item 3.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s PSI, he went into detail about his monthly income, normal \nexpenses, and monthly remainder. His monthly remainder at that time was $2,013. (Item \n3.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n          When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \nThe next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts were incurred in the 2013 and 2015 timeframe. That is not \nso long ago. Nor were those debts infrequent. And they remained in default to the present. \nBecause of the frequency and recency of the debts, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate his \ndebts. \nAddressing Applicant\u2019s student loans apparently came to the fore after he earned \nhis Master\u2019s degree in the spring of 2015. He knew after graduation that he needed to \nstart paying his loans. And he was willing and able to make payments, as attested by his \nmonthly net remainder. He was given points of contact for the creditor. He contacted \nthose contact points for about three months, but he never received any return calls. He \nbecame frustrated trying to locate the creditor. Shortly after he graduated in 2015, his \nschool closed. The closure of Applicant\u2019s school and his resultant inability to find his \ncreditor to pay for his loans are \u201cconditions. . . largely beyond\u201d his control, within the \ncontemplation of AG \u00b6 20(b). That, however, does not end the inquiry. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that Applicant act \u201cresponsibly\u201d under the adverse \ncircumstances he confronted. In this case, he knew that after graduation he would need \nto start paying off his student loans. He obtained contact information for his creditors. For \nseveral months, he used that contact information trying to reach his creditors, but to no \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \navail. Not long after, his school closed and was the subject of a federal investigation. That \nresulted in hundreds of thousands of student loans being discharged, including \nApplicant\u2019s loans. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies and mitigates his debts. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct  \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the \nallegation and applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). Under Guideline E for personal \nconduct, the concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d A statement is false or dishonest when it is made deliberately (knowingly \nand willfully). \nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified facts by failing to disclose his \ndelinquent student loans in his SCA. He unqualifiedly admitted that allegation. This \nconduct falls squarely within AG \u00b6 16(a), which states in pertinent part: \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations.  \nAG \u00b6 17(a) states in pertinent part a condition that may mitigate that disqualifying \ncondition: \n[The] individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \n \nIn this case, after falsifying by omission his SCA, Applicant\u2019s next opportunity to \ncorrect that omission was during the PSI. At the outset of the PSI, he was asked the open-\nended question whether he was currently delinquent, had any accounts that were \ncurrently in collections, or charged off. He \u201cdisclosed that he had looked at his student \nloans yesterday and that they were in defaulted [sic] and he knew they were delinquent. \n[He] knew he had to pay them but after graduation.\u201d His answer was straightforward, not \nthe product of coaching, or confrontation. He concluded this exchange as follows: \u201c[He] \ndid not list the accounts on the questionnaire because he did not have all the information \nfor the accounts, he did not intentionally omit the information.\u201d \nOn this record, Applicant used the first opportunity afforded by the security \nclearance process to rectify his omissions in the SCA. He did so without having seen the \nSOR or being confronted by the investigator. I find that Applicant mitigated his omission \nunder AG \u00b6 17(a). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n    \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n           \n \n                                     \n \n \n                                              \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n    FOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \n  Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.m.: \n \n       FOR APPLICANT \n For Applicant \n      Subparagraph 2.a.:   \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 61-year-old information technology supervisor who has worked for a Government contractor since September 2007, and has been continuously employed at an overseas location. He has worked for various Government contractors since 2001, mostly at the same overseas location. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1979 to 1985, and was honorably discharged. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1991. He was married in 2004 and divorced in 2016. He was last granted a top-secret security clearance in 2014, and reported holding security clearance eligibility since at least 2003. The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file Federal income tax returns, as required, for tax years 2017 to 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Under Guideline E, he is alleged to have falsified his 2020 SCA by failing to disclose his failure to file Federal income tax returns as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) He admitted both SOR allegations with explanations. The evidence in the record supports the SOR allegations. In his 2021 Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations, and noted that since he has lived overseas, he has always been late filing his Federal income tax returns; often two or three years late. He said his tax preparer told him that filing late was not a problem as he has never owed the Government anything. He said he is eligible for foreign earned income exclusions; therefore, he pays no taxes. He noted that since he does not own any property or investment income",

He has worked for various Government contractors since 2001, \nmostly at the same overseas location. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1979 to 1985, \nand was honorably discharged. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1991. He was married \nin 2004 and divorced in 2016. He was last granted a top-secret security clearance in 2014, \nand reported holding security clearance eligibility since at least 2003. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file Federal income tax \nreturns, as required, for tax years 2017 to 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Under Guideline E, he is \nalleged to have falsified his 2020 SCA by failing to disclose his failure to file Federal \nincome tax returns as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) He admitted both SOR \nallegations with explanations. The evidence in the record supports the SOR allegations. \nIn his 2021 Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations, and noted that \nsince he has lived overseas, he has always been late filing his Federal income tax returns; \noften two or three years late. He said his tax preparer told him that filing late was not a \nproblem as he has never owed the Government anything.

He did not believe it was \u201cnecessary to file (or at least, not on time) if one does \nnot owe.\u201d He noted that \u201cunless I run into problems, I expect to have my 2017-2020 tax \nforms mailed off within a week,\u201d and that he will \u201cuse my professionally-prepared 2017 \ntax forms as a template, so hopefully I can do it right.\u201d (Ans.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring his personal subject interview (PSI) by an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management, Applicant said he procrastinated in filing his taxes as he was \nscared and has a fear of filing his taxes.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 19 is: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record are sufficient \nto establish the disqualifying condition above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue; and  \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has a history of failing to file Federal income-tax returns when due. In \nresponse to interrogatories and in his Answer to the SOR, he claimed to be unclear as to \nwhether he is required to file Federal income-tax returns, pay taxes, or both. He failed to \nsubmit evidence to show that he was not required to file income-tax returns due to his \nforeign residency, rather he seemed to indicate that he was required to file, but \nintentionally failed to do so because of his phobia and fear of filing. \nIt is not the Government\u2019s obligation to determine Applicant\u2019s legal requirements \nwith regard to filing U.S. income-tax returns, or to submit evidence in support of \nApplicant\u2019s contentions, rather he is obligated to show that he has met his income-tax \nfiling requirements or is not required to file at all, due to his income or overseas \nemployment. When given an opportunity to support his contentions, Applicant gave \nconflicting answers and offered no documentary evidence of his Federal tax status or \nalternative filing requirements due to his foreign residence or overseas employment. He \nindicated that he has filed tax returns in the past, and he uses a tax preparer to prepare \nhis annual returns. He implied that since he does not owe Federal taxes, that he does not \nhave to file tax returns on time, or that he is fearful about filing Federal tax returns. It is \nnot clear why he fears filing or has a phobia with regard to Federal income-tax filings.

Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473\nv. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to\ncomply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established Government rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with\nrules and regulations is essential for protecting classified information. By failing to file\nFederal income-tax returns in a timely manner, Applicant did not demonstrate the high \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified\ninformation. \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues have been longstanding and remain a continuing concern. I \nam not persuaded by Applicant\u2019s claims of advice from a tax preparer, as he has known \nof the Government\u2019s concerns since his 2020 PSI and has done nothing to show that he \nis compliant with Federal tax filing requirements. I also have concerns about his overall \nfinancial responsibility and willingness to comply with future income-tax obligations as he \nstated that he failed to file his 2021 Federal income-tax return as well. (GE 4) No \nmitigating condition relieves him of his overall financial irresponsibility with regard to \nmeeting Federal income-tax filing requirements on a timely basis. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe relevant disqualifying condition under AG \u00b616 is: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant\u2019s intentional falsification of his 2020 SCA is disqualifying conduct under \nGuideline E. Applicant admitted to the SOR allegation in his Answer, and the \ndocumentary evidence supports the SOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s SCA falsification. He \nhas not filed the past-due income tax returns for tax years 2017 to 2020, but failed to \ndisclose that he failed to file his Federal income-tax returns for tax years 2017 to 2019 in \nhis 2020 SCA. A simple misreading of an SCA question or a minor omission resulting \nfrom an oversight may not rise to the level to create security concerns. On the other hand, \nfailure to exercise reasonable care in responding to questions during a clearance \ninvestigation may raise such concerns. Each case must be judged on its own facts. \nDirective \u00b6 Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant has claimed alternatively, that he had a phobia and fear about filing \nFederal income-tax returns, and that his tax preparer told him that there was no \u201cpenalty\u201d \nfor filing late. Although Applicant claimed an ability and intent to cure his tax filing issues, \nhe has failed to do so to date, including not filing his 2021 tax return after completing his \nSCA, his subject interview, and issuance of the SOR. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his 2021 \nFederal income tax return was not alleged in the SOR and may not be an independent \nbasis for denying his application for a security clearance. However, conduct not alleged \nin the SOR may be considered to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is \napplicable, to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, or \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006). \nApplicant noted in his PSI that he did not intentionally lie on his SCA, but told the \ninvestigator that he did not recall the question on his SCA and that he automatically \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to each question in the financial section. Applicant has held a security \nclearance since at least 2003. He has a long history of experience with completing SCAs, \nand knew that he had not filed years of Federal income-tax returns. His fears and phobias \nabout filing taxes may explain his failure to disclose his tax-filing delinquencies in his SCA, \nbut does not excuse it. I find that based on Applicant\u2019s extensive experience working for \na government contractor and submitting SCAs, he knew or should have known that he \nwas required to be truthful in his SCA and should have disclosed his failure to file income \ntax returns, but knowingly failed to do so. \nI am not satisfied that sufficient time has passed or that Applicant has shown that \nthis conduct is behind him and will not recur. He did not file his 2021 Federal tax return \nafter being put on notice of tax return delinquencies, and he has not taken positive steps \nto cure his 2017-2020 delinquent tax filings. His behavior continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, and he remains vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. Nothing has been submitted to persuade me that this personal \nconduct security concern resulted from unintentional conduct or that it will not persist. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s overseas work for a U.S. Government contractor and military service. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no \nopportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor, or to inquire into \nthe issues raised in the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I have carefully applied the \nlaw, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person, including \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nexceptions available under Appendix C of SEAD 4.

His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. This is his first application for a security clearance. He \nhas been employed as an engineering technician by a defense contractor since 2020. \nHe earned a high school diploma through a correspondence course in 2004. He was \nmarried in 2003, and has two adult and two minor children. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s SCA shows that he has been consistently employed since 2008. In \nhis Answer, he claimed that the reason for his outstanding debt was because he was \nlaid off and out of work for almost a year. He stated that when he became re-employed, \nhis pay was not enough to cover his living expenses and resolve his debt. He asserted \nthat he is trying to resolve outstanding debt, but he did not provide any further details. \n(Item 3) \nIn his 2021 background interview with a government investigator, Applicant was \nasked about all of the debts alleged on the SOR. He was unable to provide almost any \ninformation about the accounts, other than affirming that the debts were not resolved. \nHe stated his financial issues began in 2014 when he was laid off from a high-paying \njob. He was also addicted to illegal drugs at that time, which he claimed caused him to \nmake poor financial decisions. Between the drug use and lower pay at his next job, it \ncaused him to stop making payments on his debts. He asserted that most of these \ndebts were incurred in 2013, when he was earning more. He stated that he has not \naddressed his delinquent debts, because his focus has been on staying sober and \ntaking care of his family. Applicant has had other periods of illegal drug use and \naddiction when he was younger, and served time in prison for related offenses. (Item 3, \n4) \nThe SOR alleges seven charged-off debts totaling $21,754, and four debts in \ncollection, totaling $3,461. The status of the debts follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan that was charged off for $7,985. It is not resolved. \n(Item 4, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a credit-card account that was charged off for $4,401. It is not \nresolved.

It \nis not resolved. (Item 4, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a credit card that was charged off for $5,138. It was opened in 2012, \nand the last payment was made in 2015. This debt is not resolved. (Item 4, 5, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a debt that was charged off for $761. In his background interview, \nApplicant claimed that this debt is a duplicate of \u00b6 1.e. The credit report shows that \noriginal creditor and the debt amounts are the same, and it notes that the debt was \npurchased by another lender. This account is likely a duplicate of 1.e, which is held by a \ncollection agency. (Item 4, 5) \nApplicant did not provide any documentation showing that any of his debts have \nbeen or are being paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved. He also submitted no \ndocumentation concerning his current financial situation, such as his monthly income \nand expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a budget. He provided no evidence that \nhe has received credit counseling. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and the credit \nreports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) partially applies because Applicant stated that he is no longer using \nor addicted to illegal drugs, which he asserted caused him to make poor financial \ndecisions. However, he has had other periods of illegal drug use and addiction, so it \ncannot be found that such circumstances are unlikely to recur. Furthermore, he did not \nprovide documentation showing that any of his debts are currently being paid, or have \nbeen resolved, nor has he claimed that any are resolved. He provided no \ndocumentation of his current financial situation, evidence which might establish his \nability to address his debts responsibly. His failure to pay his charged-off and delinquent \ndebts is recent, not isolated, and are ongoing. This continues to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply. \nWhile Applicant claimed in his Answer that being out of work for almost a year \ncaused him to stop paying his debts, he did not report any periods of unemployment on \nhis SCA. He also stated that he earned less at his next job, but he did not provide any \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetails about the difference in income, and how long that circumstance lasted. Since he \nhas made no documented effort to resolve any of his charged-off or delinquent debts, \nthere is insufficient evidence to find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant claimed that \u00b6 1.k is a duplicate of \u00b6 1.e. While he provided no \ndocumentation to support his assertion, the credit report in the record supports this \nfinding. The original creditor and debt amounts are the same, and the creditor in \u00b6 1.e. \nis a collection agency, which would explain why the debts have different account \nnumbers. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.k. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s charged-\noff and delinquent debts under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

On April 8, 2022, the \ncase was assigned to me. On April 11, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Notice setting the hearing for May 12, 2022.

(Id.) \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight exhibits into evidence, and \nall proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 15, 20-21; GE 1-\nGE 8) Applicant did not offer any documents for admission into evidence. On May 31, \n2022, DOHA received a copy of the transcript. On June 15, 2022, the record closed.

Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 58-year-old senior quality inspector employed by a DOD contractor \nfor the last 34 months. (Tr. 9-10) Before her current employment, she worked for an \nautomobile company as a senior quality inspector for 42 months and for a life insurance \ncompany selling insurance for 21 years (1993 to 2014). (Tr. 11, 23; GE 1) In 1981, she \ngraduated from high school.

(Tr. 53) He \nreceives or received Social Security disability of $1,300 per month, and he has part-time \nemployment where he earns $850 per month. (Tr. 53, 77-78) He is 69 years old, and he \nmay be receiving Social Security retirement rather than Social Security disability \npayments. (Tr. 90) Applicant was off from work for six months due to knee surgeries in \nSeptember 2017 and March 2018, and her pay was reduced 50 percent while she was \nnot working. (Tr. 54-55; SOR response) She received treatments for cancer from \nSeptember 2020 to March 2021. (SOR response) Applicant\u2019s life was also complicated \nbecause of caring for a sick parent and traveling to visit her parent. (Tr. 42) Her annual \nincome is about $45,000.

She \nand her husband jointly filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in \nSeptember 2018, and this bankruptcy was dismissed in May 2019. Their first bankruptcy \nwas dismissed possibly because the trustee sent the bills for monthly payments to the \nwrong employer. (Tr. 55-57) Applicant became briefly unemployed in 2019, and the \nsecond bankruptcy filing was dismissed because of her unemployment. (Tr. 58) She is \nmaking payments to or paid most of the creditors listed in the bankruptcy documents. (Tr. \n58-64) She received financial counseling through the bankruptcy process. (Tr. 87-88) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d allege Applicant failed to pay her federal income taxes when \ndue for tax years (TY) 2007, 2008, 2009, 2015, and 2016, and she owes the federal \ngovernment about $91,490 for those five TYs. She files her tax returns separately from \nher husband. (Tr. 86) She was an IRS Form 1099 contractor when she was selling \ninsurance starting around 2007. (Tr. 24-34) She had an IRS audit possibly around 2010 \nor 2011, and there were changes in her company\u2019s payment policies. (Tr. 24-28) Her pay \nor bank account had an allotment to pay her federal income taxes for about two years, \nand it paid some of her taxes for TYs 2007 and 2008. (Tr. 28-30) She made inconsistent \nquarterly tax payments to the IRS because of large variations in her commission-based \nincome. (Tr. 30, 35) When she had extra money available, she made payments to the \nIRS. (Tr. 30) She realizes now that she should have consistently paid her quarterly taxes. \n(Tr. 30) Around 2013 or 2014, she started receiving a regular salary, and she was able to \nmake more consistent payments to the IRS. (Tr. 31-32) She estimated she may owe the \nIRS about $2,000 for TY 2021. (Tr. 47-48) \nThe IRS audited Applicant\u2019s income and concluded her income was much higher \nthan Applicant believed it was, and the auditor assessed that Applicant owed a substantial \nfederal tax debt. (Tr. 37-38) On July 10, 2012, the IRS recorded three tax liens as follows. \n(GE 5 at 17) \nOn November 28, 2018, in connection with Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy filing in \nSeptember 2018, the IRS filed a Proof of Claim for Internal Revenue Taxes for Applicant \nand her husbands\u2019 bankruptcy with total secured claims of $67,284 with the following \ninformation.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances.

Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. In 2016, Applicant\u2019s \nhusband had a surgery, and he was unable to work. He returned to work for about 18 \nmonths, and then he had another surgery. He receives or received Social Security \ndisability of $1,300 per month, and he has part-time employment where he earns $850 \nper month. He is receiving benefits from Social Security. \nApplicant was off from work for six months due to two knee surgeries in September \n2017 and March 2018, and her pay was reduced 50 percent while she was not working. \nIn 2019, she was briefly unemployed at the time that her bankruptcy was dismissed. She \nreceived treatments for cancer from September 2020 to March 2021. Her life was further \ncomplicated because of caring for a sick parent and traveling to visit her parent. These \ncircumstances were beyond her control, and they adversely affected her finances. \nHowever, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider whether \napplicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial \ndifficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(b) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. She did not \nprove that she maintained contact with the IRS over the years or that she worked diligently \nto timely pay her federal income taxes. \nApplicant is credited with mitigating SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b because she explained \nwhy the bankruptcies were dismissed. She mitigated the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h \nbecause after her and her husband\u2019s bankruptcy was dismissed, she paid her debts on \nher own, except for her federal income tax debt and her mortgage debt. The mortgage \ndebt was resolved through the FHA paying any deficiency. \nApplicant estimated that she owes the IRS about $90,000.

See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, \nno foul\u201d approach to an applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that \nends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information \nwith focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nApplying the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f are not \nmitigated. She did not prove that she was unable to make greater progress sooner \nestablishing a payment plan with the IRS and paying her federal income taxes. Under all \nthe circumstances, she failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 58-year-old senior quality inspector employed by a DOD contractor \nfor the last 34 months. Before her current employment, she worked for an automobile \ncompany as a senior quality inspector for 42 months and for a life insurance company \nselling insurance for 21 years (1993 to 2014). She received an associate\u2019s degree, a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2016, and a master\u2019s degree in industrial organization psychology \nin 2018. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nApplicant provided important financial considerations mitigating information. She \nprovided multiple reasons for her financial difficulties. Aside from her delinquent federal \nincome taxes, she has done a good job paying her creditors and maintaining her financial \nresponsibility. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not establish that she was unable to make greater progress sooner \nestablishing a payment plan for her delinquent federal income taxes and paying her \nfederal income tax debt, which she estimates to total about $90,000. Her failure to take \nprudent responsible actions raise unmitigated questions about her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 39 years old. He married in 2006 and divorced in 2008. He remarried in 2016 and has two young children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006 and a master\u2019s degree in 2008. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor as a cybersecurity engineer since March 2017. He was first granted a security clearance in June 2010. He seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Tr. at 32-39; GE 1 at 7, 14, 23-25, 29, 129-131; AE G.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he has a history of drug involvement and substance misuse. Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2003 or 2004 to July 2011 (SOR 1.a). The SOR also alleged that Applicant used marijuana in July 2011 (2011 Marijuana Use) after he had been granted a security clearance (SOR 1.b). The SOR further alleged that Applicant used the prescription medication Xanax without a prescription from about 2006 to 2008 (SOR 1.c). In the Answer, Applicant admitted all three allegations with explanations and other mitigating information. Applicant began smoking marijuana with his college girlfriend in about 2003. They used marijuana regularly through their college years and after they married in 2006. Applicant and his wife separated and divorced two years later. During their brie",

On September 28, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nAdjudicative Guidelines H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and E (Personal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective \nwithin the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded the SOR (Answer) on December 2, 2021. He attached to the \nAnswer 15 documents marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through O and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nApril 4, 2022. The case was assigned to me on April 19, 2022. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on May 9, 2022, scheduling \nthe case to be heard via video teleconference on June 30, 2022. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered the \n15 exhibits attached to his Answer and five additional exhibits marked as AE P through \nT. His exhibits were admitted without objection. Applicant and a character witness \ntestified. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 13, 2022. (Tr. at 14-\n16.) \nI kept the record open to provide Department Counsel with the opportunity to \nresearch the Government\u2019s investigative file from 2010 to determine if Applicant was \ninterviewed in connection with his 2010 security clearance application (2010 SCA), and if \nso, to submit a copy of the interview summary. Department Counsel subsequently \nreported in an email that she had reviewed the available records and did not find an \ninterview summary. She also submitted three exhibits, marked as GE 5 through 7 for \nidentification purposes, which are the Case Closing Transmittal forms prepared by the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) at the conclusion of the agency\u2019s three \nbackground investigations of Applicant in 2020, 2012-13, and 2010, respectively.  \nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of GE 5 through 7 on the grounds \nthat they were inadmissible under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 in the absence of the testimony of \nan authenticating witness. He also objected to the admission of Department Counsel\u2019s \nemails on this subject on the ground that they were merely argument, not evidence. I \noverrule counsel\u2019s objection regarding GE 5 through 7, as these documents are official \nrecords of the U.S. Government. The cited section of the Directive specifically states that \nofficial records are admissible without an authenticating witness. Moreover, the proposed \nexhibits are not \u201cDoD personnel background reports of investigation (ROIs),\u201d which are \nexcluded under an exception in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 from the general rule of admissibility \nof official records. I agree with Applicant\u2019s counsel that the emails from Department \nCounsel on this subject are merely argument, as are the replies of Applicant\u2019s counsel. \nAs such, they are not admissible as evidence and will not be weighed as evidence, but \nthe arguments contained therein will be given the consideration they deserve like any \nother argument of counsel.

He married in 2006 and divorced in 2008. He remarried \nin 2016 and has two young children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006 and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2008. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor as a \ncybersecurity engineer since March 2017. He was first granted a security clearance in \nJune 2010. He seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment. (Tr. at 32-39; GE 1 at 7, 14, 23-25, 29, 129-131; AE G.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a \nclearance because he has a history of drug involvement and substance misuse. \nSpecifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from \n2003 or 2004 to July 2011 (SOR 1.a). The SOR also alleged that Applicant used \nmarijuana in July 2011 (2011 Marijuana Use) after he had been granted a security \nclearance (SOR 1.b). The SOR further alleged that Applicant used the prescription \nmedication Xanax without a prescription from about 2006 to 2008 (SOR 1.c). In the \nAnswer, Applicant admitted all three allegations with explanations and other mitigating \ninformation. \nApplicant began smoking marijuana with his college girlfriend in about 2003. They \nused marijuana regularly through their college years and after they married in 2006. \nApplicant and his wife separated and divorced two years later. During their brief marriage, \nhis former wife also encouraged Applicant to take Xanax, a prescription drug prescribed \nto her, to reduce his stress and anxiety. Applicant described his ex-wife as mature, \nintelligent, and controlling, and he described himself at the time as immature, insecure, \ninexperienced, and easily controlled. After receiving his master\u2019s degree in 2008, he \nbegan life on his own and separated himself from being under the control of his former \nwife. He also began his professional career. In late 2007 or early 2008, he also stopped \nusing illegal drugs and misusing prescription drugs. At the same time, he stopped \nassociating with friends who used illegal drugs. (Tr. at 36-40, 44-48, 74; GE 4 at 7.) \nIn 2011 Applicant was deployed to a war zone for about four months working for a \ndefense contractor supporting the U.S. Marine Corps. He was working at a forward \noperating base and moved to other similar locations during his deployment. He \nexperienced a dangerous environment on a daily basis. After he returned to the United \nStates, he visited his uncle who offered him marijuana to celebrate his safe return from \nthe war zone. Applicant briefly smoked the marijuana, but then realized that he made a \nmistake because he held a security clearance. He has not used marijuana since this \nincident in July 2011.

The SOR cross-alleged under this guideline the three Guideline H \nallegations described above (SOR 2.a). The SOR also alleged that Applicant provided \nfalse information about the date of his last use of marijuana in his March 15, 2013 \nbackground interview (2013 Interview) (SOR 2.b). The SOR alleged further that he \ndeliberately omitted his past drug use as alleged in SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c in his 2012 SCA \n(SOR 2.c) and that he failed to disclose his drug use as alleged in SOR 1.a and 1.c in his \nMay 18, 2010 security clearance application (2010 SCA) (SOR 2.d). Applicant admitted \nall four SOR allegations in the Answer with explanations and other mitigating information. \nAt the time of his 2020 e-QIP, he properly disclosed the responsive information \nabout his use of marijuana once in July 2011 while he held a security clearance. The \napplicable question had no time limitation. The e-QIP did not require disclosure of his \nmarijuana use prior to 2008 because that illegal drug use was outside of the seven-year \ntimeframe of the relevant question. \nMitigation and Whole Person Evidence  \nApplicant provided extensive documentary evidence and testimony in mitigation of \nthe security concerns raised under both Guideline H and Guideline E. All of his evidence \nsupports my observation of Applicant that he is a mature, responsible, and honest person, \nwho has fully taken control of his life. The documentary evidence covers a number of \nissues. Applicant has received numerous awards and other recognitions of his \naccomplishments. He provided copies of his degrees, training certificates and \nperformance evaluations. The evaluations reflect that he is a valued employee. He also \nsubmitted a statement of his intent to never use illegal drugs in the future along with \nnegative drug test results evidencing that he is committed to his stated intent. He \nunderwent a psychological and substance abuse evaluation in which the evaluator \nconcluded that Applicant is not at risk of using drugs in the future. In addition, he submitted \ncertificates evidencing that he took a drug and alcohol awareness course, a behavior \nmodification course, and a marijuana education class. (AE C \u2013 T.) \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits include three character reference letters from supervisors and \na co-worker. They are all aware of Applicant\u2019s drug history and his falsifications dating \nback to the 2010 to 2013 period. Each of the references support Applicant as a person \nwho has learned from his past mistakes and grown into a highly responsible and honest \nperson. (AE C.) \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and his witness\u2019 testimony were impressive. Applicant \nexplained that his drug use 14 or more years ago was during a period when he was young \nand was under the influence of his ex-wife, who was a frequent drug user. He testified \nthat she was diagnosed as bipolar or suffering from multiple personalities disorder, which \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis now referred to as dissociative identity disorder. Although she encouraged him to \nsmoke marijuana with her and to use her prescription Xanax pills, he blamed himself for \nbeing susceptible to manipulation and for being immature and inexperienced. He also \ntestified that his one-time use of marijuana in July 2011 was an instance of poor judgment \nfollowing a very difficult and traumatic experience in a dangerous war zone. He was \noverwhelmed by his safe return to his home and let his guard down to celebrate with his \nuncle, who is a marijuana user. Applicant has since told his uncle that he has no interest \nin using marijuana in the future and asked his uncle to refrain from doing so in front of \nhim. He regrets his poor judgment at the time. He has no intention to use illegal drugs in \nthe future and has signed a statement submitted into the record to support his testimony. \n(Tr. at 30-51, 69-70; AE K.) \nApplicant testified that his omissions in his 2010 SCA of his past drug use were \ndue to poor judgment and fear that his drug use may adversely affect his clearance \neligibility. He testified further that he was interviewed 2010 at the U.S. Navy base where \nhe was working briefly as a contractor. He said that he reported his pre-2008 use of \nmarijuana and Xanax to the investigator and that he acknowledged that he was wrong to \nomit this information from his 2010 SCA. After the hearing Department Counsel argued \nthat the Government\u2019s records do not reflect that such an interview took place because \nthe OPM Case Closing Transmittal form (GE 7) does not list this investigative step and \nthere was no record of a report summarizing such an interview in the Government\u2019s paper \nor electronic files. (Tr. at 82-85; GE 7.) \nApplicant testified that he when he prepared his 2012 SCA, he understood that he \nwas only being asked to update his information since his 2010 SCA and that he was not \nbeing asked to disclose seven years of drug use. He credibly testified that it was not his \nintention to mislead the Government in his 2012 SCA about his pre-2008 drug use in his \n2012 SCA. When he was interviewed in March 2013, he fully disclosed his pre-2008 use \nof marijuana and Xanax. This disclosure was voluntary because the report of the interview \ndoes not reflect that the Investigator had information about his prior drug use and \nconfronted him about it and his nondisclosure in the 2012 SCA. (Tr. at 76-80: GE 4 at 6.) \nApplicant acknowledged that in his 2012 SCA he omitted his July 2011 use of \nmarijuana. He also did not disclose this incident to the investigator in his March 2013 \nbackground interview. He testified that he incorrectly concluded that his 2011 drug use \nwas not security significant since it was a one-time use. He was alone at the time he \nprepared the 2012 SCA and was recovering from his divorce in 2008 without having fully \nmatured. He did not have friends of his own who he trusted to advise him. (Tr. at 53-67; \nGE 4 at 6.) \nIn the Report of Investigation (ROI) summarizing Applicant\u2019s April 2020 OPM \nbackground interview, the investigator detailed Applicant\u2019s comments regarding his \nadmission in his 2020 e-QIP about a one-time use of marijuana in July 2011 with his \nuncle. The investigator also wrote that, \u201c[Applicant] had never used an illegal drug prior \nto this,\u201d apparently referring to the July 2011 incident discussed in immediately preceding \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclause in the ROI. In response to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories, Applicant verified that the ROI \ncorrectly stated his comments to the investigators with two corrections. In one correction, \nApplicant wrote that the language quoted above \u201cis not accurate and [I] do not recall this \nbeing part of the conversation.\u201d (GE 4 at 2, 22.) At the hearing, Applicant also denied \nmaking that statement during his April 2020 interview. In the absence of a verification by \nApplicant of the ROI language attributing a statement to him about prior drug use or his \nadoption of the quoted statement as a correct statement, the disputed language of the \nROI is inadmissible evidence under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 since no witness testified to \nauthenticate the ROI. Appropriately, the SOR does not allege that Applicant falsified \ninformation in his April 2020 Interview about his past drug use. (Tr. at 92-102.) \nApplicant emphasized that he has learned about the importance of personal \nintegrity and the honesty after he remarried and began his work with his current employer. \nSince about 2016, he has become an adult with significant family and work \nresponsibilities. In his 2020 e-QIP, he disclosed his July 2011 use of marijuana after \nhaving been granted a security clearance in 2010. He testified that this disclosure was \nthe result of the changes he has made in his life. (Tr. at 53-67.) \nWith respect to his character, Applicant\u2019s witness provided a strong endorsement \nof Applicant\u2019s maturity and integrity. Applicant described his witness as his \u201cmentor.\u201d The \nwitness has known Applicant since about 2017 and at one point was Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor. He still has daily interactions with Applicant as a senior person in Applicant\u2019s \ndivision of a large defense contractor. The witness endorsed Applicant\u2019s maturity, \nintelligence, expertise, integrity, and work ethic. He believes that the person Applicant is \ntoday is not the same person Applicant was ten or more years ago when he the incidents \nalleged in the SOR occurred. He believes that Applicant today exercises excellent \njudgment and is a person of integrity. (Tr. at 17-29, 61.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.      \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and his detailed testimony regarding his \nhistory of drug use establish the above disqualifying conditions and shift the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nBoth of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s last drug use was \nwhen he held a clearance in 2011, but it occurred more than eleven years ago under \nunusual circumstances. It is unlikely that Applicant will repeat such behavior in the future. \nAlso, his frequent drug use more than 14 years ago is not recent enough to be of security \nsignificance. Applicant\u2019s past behavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. In addition, Applicant\u2019s evidence has satisfactorily \naddressed AG \u00b6 26(b) and each of the subsections thereunder. \nIn my mitigation analysis, I have also taken administrative notice of the Security \nExecutive Agent \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to \nAccess Classified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n21, 2021 (Guidance). In her Guidance, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) noted the \nincreased number of states that have legalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana. \nShe reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the importance of compliance with \nFederal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by holders of security clearances. She \nprovided further clarification of Federal marijuana policy writing that this policy remains \nrelevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that \nthe adjudicative guidelines provided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to \nmitigate security concerns raised by his or her past use of marijuana. (Guidance at 1.) \nFollowing careful consideration of the disqualifying and mitigating evidence, as well \nas SecEA\u2019s recent clarifying guidance regarding Federal policy concerning marijuana use \nby holders of security clearances, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his past use of marijuana and his misuse of a prescription drug. \nParagraph 1 is found in favor of Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant used marijuana and misused a prescription drug in the past. He also \nused marijuana on one occasion while holding a security clearance. AG \u00b6 16(c) is \nestablished. \nApplicant deliberately provided false information in his 2010 SCA about his past \ndrug use. On the other hand, Applicant credibly testified that he did not deliberately omit \nin his 2012 SCA information about his earlier use of marijuana and misuse of Xanax \nbecause he believed he had disclosed that information in a 2010 Interview and he was \nmerely updating his prior investigation when he prepared his 2012 SCA. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence does not reflect that Applicant was interviewed in 2010. \nMoreover, the Government presented no evidence to explain the significance of the \nabsence in the Government\u2019s file of a Report of Investigation summarizing an interview \nof Applicant in 2010 or of the information in GE 7, the OPM Case Closing Transmittal \nform. Accordingly, I give more weight to Applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he was \ninterviewed in 2010 and disclosed his drug use during that interview. In 2012 Applicant \nbelieved the new application was just an update in light of his disclosure of his drug use \nin the 2010 Interview. He was dealing with an unusual situation in 2012 when asked to \nprepare a new application two years after his first one had resulted in the granting of a \nclearance. His misinterpretation of the disclosure requirements in the 2012 SCA does not \namount to a willful falsification. \nApplicant also testified that his failure to disclose his 2011 use of marijuana in his \n2012 SCA was due to his belief that it was not necessary to report it because it was a \none-time use of marijuana and was not of any security significance. Arguably, he did not \ndeliberately provide false information in that application, he merely made a mistake based \nupon a lack of understanding of what was required. He did testify, however, that he \nregretted smoking marijuana with his uncle in 2011 because he knew it was wrong since \nhe held a security clearance. I conclude that he knowingly and deliberately provided false \ninformation by not disclosing that more recent drug use in his 2012 SCA and his 2013 \ninterview. \nAs a result of my conclusions that the evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions \nestablish three deliberate falsifications by Applicant in the past, AG \u00b6 16(a) and (b) are \nalso established. The burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised \nby his conduct. AG \u00b6 17 includes four conditions that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s behavior in 2010, 2012, and 2013: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nApplicant has fully established all of the above mitigating conditions. The most \nrecent of the three established falsifications occurred during the 2013 Interview, over nine \nyears ago. Applicant has provided significant evidence of the changes he has made and \nhis maturing experiences over the past nine years, including a solid, healthy marriage, a \nyoung family, a job with significant security responsibilities, and a mentor who has taught \nhim the importance of personal integrity. He no longer associates with his ex-wife, who \nengaged in criminal behavior and encouraged him to participate in such behavior. He now \nappreciates the value of integrity and when asked to complete a security clearance \napplication in 2020, he honestly disclosed the most derogatory information in his personal \nhistory, i.e., that he had a one-time experience with marijuana seven years earlier while \nholding a clearance. He had failed to disclose this information in his 2013 interview, but \nhe did the right thing in his 2020 e-QIP. He understood that his disclosure may have \nserious consequences. The Government investigated his disclosure and initiated the \ninstant proceedings to deny him eligibility for a clearance, which carries with it the \npotential loss of his employment. By this action, he has fully acknowledged that his prior \nfalsifications were wrong. He has taken responsibility for his past behavior and eliminated \nhis vulnerability to exploitation. As a result, his offenses in 2010, 2012, and 2013 do not \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Accordingly, paragraph 2 of \nthe SOR is found in favor of Applicant. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the whole-person \nfactors quoted above. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his past \nuse of marijuana and Xanax and his repeated falsifications years ago. His testimony and \nother evidence has established that he has grown and matured since 2013 and now \nplaces a high value on his integrity. He has accepted that his security clearance requires \nthat he be fully honest about his past even if it means that his honesty could result in \nserious damage to his career and his ability to support his young family. By his actions, \nhe has established that his past conduct will not be repeated in the future. Overall, the \nrecord evidence does not raise any questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a through 2.d: \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e), while also providing additional explanation to his admissions for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. His admissions and explanations are included in the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since February 2018. He earned a high school degree in 2007, attended community college for a year, then earned a trade certificate in 2016. He served on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps from September 2008 until September 2013, deploying to Afghanistan for seven months in 2010 and in 2012. He held a security clearance while he was in the military. He has never been married and has no children, but has lived with a co-habitant since December 2017. (Items 5, 6) Applicant began drinking when he was about 16 years old. Throughout high school, he drank about one or two beers per week. He started drinking more alcohol after he finished his Marine Corps boot camp, when he drank about one or two beers per night until early in 2010. In early 2010, he started drinking hard liquor. Within a couple of months, he was consuming about one-half bottle of hard liquor per night. For the remainder of his time in the military, his drinking varied from two beers in seven months to about one-half bottle of hard liqu",

His admissions and explanations are included in the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since February 2018. He earned a high school degree in 2007, \nattended community college for a year, then earned a trade certificate in 2016. He \nserved on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps from September 2008 until September \n2013, deploying to Afghanistan for seven months in 2010 and in 2012. He held a \nsecurity clearance while he was in the military. He has never been married and has no \nchildren, but has lived with a co-habitant since December 2017. (Items 5, 6) \nApplicant began drinking when he was about 16 years old. Throughout high \nschool, he drank about one or two beers per week. He started drinking more alcohol \nafter he finished his Marine Corps boot camp, when he drank about one or two beers \nper night until early in 2010. In early 2010, he started drinking hard liquor. Within a \ncouple of months, he was consuming about one-half bottle of hard liquor per night. For \nthe remainder of his time in the military, his drinking varied from two beers in seven \nmonths to about one-half bottle of hard liquor per night, depending upon his military \nrequirements. (Items 1, 4-6, 8, 9) \nFrom 2013 until spring 2016, Applicant drank one-fourth of a bottle of hard liquor \nper night. In spring 2016, he moved in with his parents and switched to drinking four to \nfive beers per night until October 2016. In about October 2016, he was arrested in State \nA and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He had consumed \nabout eight to nine shots of alcohol at a bar with one of his co-workers. He had a blood \nalcohol content level of .183. He spent the night in jail. (Items 1, 4-9) \nAs a result of this DUI, Applicant did not drink for six months. From December \n2016 until April 2017, Applicant attended 22 hours of out-patient alcohol treatment. On \nhis intake form for this treatment, his stated goal was to abstain from alcohol. During \nthis outpatient alcohol treatment, he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder-moderate, \nand his treatment counselor recommended that he abstain from alcohol indefinitely. \nHowever, in contravention of his counselor\u2019s recommendation, by the end of his \ntreatment, his stated goal was to drink alcohol in moderation. In April 2017, he started \ndrinking again. He soon progressed back to one-half bottle of hard liquor per night. \n(Items 1, 4-9) \nIn November 2017, Applicant was convicted of the DUI charge from October \n2016. He was placed on probation for one year and ordered to pay court costs and \nfines. He was ordered to complete 50 hours of community service, attend alcohol \nawareness courses, and submit to drug/alcohol testing. His probation was reduced to \nsix months because he had already completed most of the court-ordered requirements \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nby the time he was convicted. He had his driver\u2019s license restricted to business \npurposes only for an additional six months. Applicant stated that his DUI taught him a \nlesson. He claimed that he learned to never drink and drive again. (Items 1, 4-9) \nAs of May 2020, Applicant was consuming one-fourth to one-half bottle of hard \nliquor per night. He drank to intoxication three nights per week. He sometimes needed \nto drink alcohol to help him fall asleep at night. He often drank at home with his \ngirlfriend. It took him nine beers or three mixed drinks to get intoxicated. As of May \n2020, despite his prior treatment diagnosis and recommendation, Applicant did not think \nhe had a problem with alcohol and had no plans to stop drinking. He acknowledged that \nhis drinking sometimes caused him to be late for work, and that his girlfriend \ncomplained about his drinking. (Items 1, 4-6, 8, 9) \nAs a result of a referral by the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication \nFacility (DOD CAF), in May 2021, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation by a \nlicensed clinical psychologist (Psychologist). The Psychologist was contracted by the \nDOD CAF. In order to make her psychological evaluation, the Psychologist reviewed \nbackground information submitted by the DOD CAF, the results of a clinical interview, \nand the results of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) that Applicant completed \nfollowing the interview. (Items 1, 4-6, 8, 9) \nBased upon these measuring tools, the Psychologist diagnosed Applicant with \nalcohol use disorder (moderate). She opined that he should be further evaluated in \norder to rule out post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorder. She \nnoted the marked discrepancy between what Applicant told her about his drinking habits \nversus what was contained in the background information submitted by the CAF. \nApplicant told the Psychologist that he only consumed one to two beers per night and \ndenied that he ever drank one-fourth to one-half bottles of liquor per night. He failed to \nreport to the Psychologist that he sometimes needed alcohol to sleep, that alcohol had \nled to tardiness at work, or that his girlfriend disapproved of how much he drank. Based \nupon these discrepancies, she found that the information Applicant provided to her \nduring his clinical interview may be unreliable. She found that he has a guarded \nprognosis, and questioned his trustworthiness. (Items 1, 4-6, 8, 9) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n (a)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has a history of habitually drinking large amounts of alcohol to the point \nof intoxication. Applicant was arrested for DUI in 2016. In late 2016, while attending out\u00ad\npatient alcohol treatment, he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder and told that he \nshould abstain from alcohol. Instead, once he finished his treatment, Applicant began \ndrinking heavily again. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder again in May 2021. \nThe above disqualifying conditions are established. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nDespite receiving a treatment recommendation that he no longer consume \nalcohol, Applicant continues to drink. Even if one is to believe the account of his alcohol \nconsumption he gave the Psychologist that she found to be unreliable, he is still drinking \nevery night. His excessive drinking is ongoing. There is insufficient evidence to show \nthat he acknowledges that he has a problem with alcohol. As his treatment \nrecommendation is to abstain from alcohol, his decision to continue drinking casts doubt \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. None of the mitigating conditions \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and multiple deployments. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

The SOR explained why the DCSA CAF was unable to \nfind it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for him. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe DCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn January 11, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). On March 24, 2022, a DOHA Department Counsel indicated that the \nGovernment was ready to proceed to a hearing. On April 11, 2022, the case was assigned \nto me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national \nsecurity interests of the United States to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. I received the case file and assignment on April 18, 2022. \nAfter some coordination with the parties, on May 12, 2022, I scheduled a hearing \nfor June 8, 2022. At the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1 through 5) and two \nApplicant exhibits (AE A-B) were admitted into the record without any objections. One \nwitness, the special agent who conducted Applicant\u2019s PSI, testified for the Government. \nApplicant and his chief union steward also testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript \n(Tr.) received on June 24, 2022. \nI held the record open for two weeks after the hearing for Applicant to submit \nadditional documentation. On June 20, 2022, Applicant timely submitted five character-\nreference letters, which I accepted in evidence without objection as AE C through G. The \nrecord closed on June 27, 2022, on receipt of the Government\u2019s response to Applicant\u2019s \npost-hearing submissions. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR \u00b6 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline \nJ (SOR \u00b6 3.a) and Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 4.f), that Applicant was arrested for driving under \nthe influence (DUI) offenses in February 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and September 2018 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b), and for operating under the influence (hereafter DUI) in October 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nUnder Guideline H (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and cross-alleged under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 3.a) and \nGuideline E (SOR \u00b6 4.a), Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in February 2014, \nwhile granted access to classified information, and charged with possession of less than \none-half ounce of cannabis. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is also alleged to have falsified a May 17, 2017 \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by not disclosing the 2014 \nmarijuana possession charge in response to the police record inquiries (SOR \u00b6 4.a) and \nby denying any illegal drug involvement in response to a question concerning any drug \nuse while possessing a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 4.b). Applicant is also alleged to have \nconcealed the September 2018 and October 2018 DUI offenses and the 2014 marijuana \npossession charge when questioned during his December 2019 PSI (SOR \u00b6 4.c). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant allegedly failed to self-report his September 2018 (SOR \u00b6 4.d) and \nOctober 2018 (SOR \u00b6 4.e) DUIs to his FSO. \nApplicant denied all of the allegations when he responded to the SOR, including \nthe DUIs, which he denied on the basis that he had passed the outpatient programs \nwithout incident and no recurrence since the October 2018 offense. He explained about \nthe marijuana charge that he was ticketed $50, but that the marijuana was left in his car \nby a former colleague. He asserted he had forgotten about the ticket for marijuana \npossession, and he denied any intentional concealment of his DUIs or the marijuana \ncharge. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old high school graduate, who subsequently completed \nvocational training in July 2005. (GE 2.) He worked as a technician in the automotive \nrepair industry for over a decade before going to work in equipment repair for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, in late May 2017. (AE A; Tr. 56.) He served honorably as \na wheeled vehicle mechanic with a clearance in the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) from May \n2007 to June or July 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 49-50, 56-57.) He has never married and has no \nchildren. (GE 1; Tr. 56.) \nOn November 14, 2006, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-QIP \nin application for a secret clearance for his Army enlistment. He listed two speeding tickets \nfrom September 2005 and September 2006, but no other issues. (GE 2.) He was granted \na secret clearance for his duties in the military. (GE 1.) \nOn February 23, 2014, Applicant was stopped by the police in the parking lot of a \nlocal convenience store. He exhibited signs of intoxication, including glassy eyes and \nslurred speech. He told the police he had consumed four beers at a local pub and \nadmitted that he was \u201cinebriated.\u201d The police directed him to a dry portion of the sidewalk. \nAfter failing field sobriety tests, he was arrested for DUI. During an inventory search of \nApplicant\u2019s vehicle, the police found marijuana and two glass pipes containing marijuana \nunder his driver\u2019s seat; marijuana residue in his center console; and a marijuana grinder \nin the pocket of his driver\u2019s door. (GE 5.) Applicant was subsequently charged with DUI \nand possession of less than one half ounce of cannabis, first offense. He was fined $50 \nfor the marijuana charge. (GE 3; Tr. 48.) Applicant asserts that he was told by the \nprosecutor that \u201cit was the equivalent of a parking ticket with a $50 fine.\u201d (Tr. 48.) For the \nDUI, he was required to attend 15 alcohol-education classes. On his completion of the \nclasses, the charge was dismissed and his record was sealed. (GE 3.) He asserts that \nhis command in the USAR was aware of his arrest. (Tr. 51.) \nOn May 17, 2017, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-QIP for the \nsecurity clearance needed for his current employment. In response to the police record \ninquiries, he reported his 2014 arrest for DUI and indicated that he had to attend 15 \nclasses for the offense. He did not disclose that he had also been charged with, and fined \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor, marijuana possession, and responded negatively to questions regarding illegal use \nof drugs or drug activity including the following: \nHave you EVER illegally used or otherwise been involved with a drug or \ncontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance other than \npreviously listed? (GE 1.) \nApplicant\u2019s clearance eligibility was renewed through the military about four or five months \nafter he submitted his e-QIP, and it was transferred for his work with a defense contractor. \n(Tr. 60.) \nOn September 23, 2018, Applicant was on a business trip in another state for his \nemployer when he was pulled over for not having his headlights on. He told the police \nthat he had consumed three beers with dinner, but he had a strong odor of alcohol about \nhim and slurred speech. He failed field sobriety testing and was arrested for DUI. At the \npolice station, his blood alcohol content (BAC) tested at .14% by breathalyzer. (GE 4.) \nApplicant pled guilty to DUI, was fined $460, and ordered to attend alcohol-education \nclasses within one year. As of December 4, 2019, he had not completed the required \nalcohol-education classes as he was asking the court to accept classes taken as a result \nof a subsequent DUI offense, committed in October 2018 in his state. (GE 3.) \nApplicant consumed about four to five beers at a bar while out on a date in October \n2018. He and his date drove separately, and he did not feel too impaired to drive safely. \nHe was pulled over while exiting a highway on suspicion of drunk driving. Applicant told \nthe officer that he had consumed some alcohol on a date, and he failed field sobriety \ntests. He was arrested for DUI and brought to the police station. Applicant recalls that his \nbreathalyzer result showed a .12% BAC. In April 2019, his driver\u2019s license was suspended \npending the installation of an Interlock device on his vehicle, which he had installed in \nNovember 2019. He was placed on probation for 18 months, and was required to attend \neight alcohol-education classes, and complete 100 hours of community service. As of \nDecember 2019, he had attended seven alcohol-education classes but had yet to start \nhis community service or complete the alcohol-education classes required for his \nSeptember 2018 DUI in another state. (GE 3.) \nOn December 4, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator, \nwho confirmed that Applicant was very nervous. (Tr. 26-27.) When asked about his \ndisclosed February 2014 DUI arrest, Applicant stated that he had consumed three to four \nbeers while playing video games in his home before driving to a local convenience store. \nHe claimed that he failed only one field sobriety test in that he could not walk a straight \nline because of ice on the ground. He denied that any drugs were involved in that arrest; \nthat he ever used any illegal drugs; and that he had an additional criminal charges to \nreport since completing his e-QIP in May 2017. (GE 3; Tr. 19.) Additional questioning by \nthe investigator elicited an admission and details from Applicant about his October 2018 \nDUI, including that his BAC tested at .12% and that he was on 18 months of probation. \nHe expressed regret for the incident, but asserted that he did not believe he has an \nalcohol problem.

(GE 3; Tr. \n19-20.) He was then confronted about the February 2014 marijuana possession charge. \nApplicant asserted that the marijuana found in his vehicle belonged to a former co-worker \nwho must have dropped it in his vehicle, although he also stated that he had never seen \nthis co-worker use or possess an illegal drug. Applicant expressed that he pled guilty to \npossession of marijuana because the drug was in his vehicle, and he paid a fine. He \ndenied any intention to conceal the drug charge, and explained that he had forgotten \nabout it when he completed his e-QIP and when questioned during his PSI. (GE 3.) \nAfter discussing the drug charge with the investigator, Applicant again denied any \nadditional arrests or charges involving drugs or alcohol before additional questioning by \nthe investigator disclosed his arrest for DUI while out of state on business in September \n2018. (GE 3; Tr. 20-21.) He explained that he believed he passed field sobriety testing, \nbut admitted that he \u201cblew a .12 failing the [breathalyzer] test.\u201d He admitted that, in \nFebruary 2019, he pled guilty to DUI, paid a $460 fine, and was sentenced to complete \nalcohol-education classes within one year. He explained that he had not disclosed the \narrest in response to previous questioning because he was scared that it would adversely \naffect his security clearance eligibility. He stated that he reported the incident to his \nsupervisor, co-workers, and military command, but not to his FSO because he did not \nknow that it was required. (GE 3.) The investigator recalls that Applicant provided him \nwith contact information for his military chain of command and for his civilian department \nhead, who could corroborate his self-report (Tr. 27), and that Applicant told him that he \ndid not know he had to notify his FSO. (Tr. 31-32.) \nThe investigator flagged Applicant as having questionable integrity because he \nhad to question Applicant numerous times, and had to confront him with the evidence of \nthe charges before Applicant provided the information about his 2018 DUIs and 2014 \ndrug charge. (Tr. 22-23.) However, the investigator believes that, after Applicant admitted \nthat he had not disclosed his September 2018 DUI because of fear it would affect his \nclearance, Applicant was \u201cas transparent as possible with [him] after the fact in regards \nto self-admitting.\u201d (Tr. 23.) \nApplicant testified about his PSI as follows: \nAs the interview went along, yes, I was very nervous. It was an interview \nthat randomly came up with no knowledge of anything that was occurring. \nSo yes, I was absolutely nervous. And I do not believe I was asked that \nmany times to recollect. From my memory I do remember Special Agent \n[name omitted] asking me was there anything else. And I stuttered when I \ntold him. And told him about the DUIs. And my verbiage at the end was, \nyes, I am aware that these can affect your security clearance that\u2019s why that \nmakes me nervous. Not the fact that I was hiding it made me nervous. So \nthat was also a clear misinterpretation of what I was saying or what I thought \nI clearly came across with towards him. And still, I was very nervous of what \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas going on, not knowing what was going on. Because this process has \nalso, the actual investigation is also, came up when it started in 2020. Has \nalso stopped me from reenlisting in the [USAR]. (Tr. 49-50.) \nApplicant testified at his hearing that he never tried to hide his DUIs from anybody \nand that he \u201cclearly and openly\u201d talked to his bosses and co-workers as a group. He also \ntestified that he made his motor sergeant, platoon sergeant, first sergeant, and \ncommander in the USAR aware of his DUIs because he knew they could affect his career. \n(Tr. 51.) He asserts that he was told by his co-workers to make sure he reported any DUIs \non his e-QIP. (Tr. 52-53.) As for his alleged concealment of the marijuana charge, \nApplicant testified as follows: \nAnd [the special agent] asked me several times about the marijuana. I \nhonestly didn\u2019t remember that charge. Or that ticket. Because my \ninformation was that it was a ticket so I could throw that out of my memory. \nThe thing to worry about was the DUI and making sure that got out on my \ne-QIP. And then going from my DUIs, making sure I don\u2019t get another one. \n(Tr. 53.) \nWhen asked on cross-examination to explain why he did not tell the investigator \nabout his 2018 DUIs when asked about any additional alcohol offenses, Applicant \nresponded that he did inform the investigator. As to why he had to be questioned so many \ntimes, Applicant disputed that the interview went as the investigator reported in his \nsummary (GE 3) and testified. Applicant maintains he never denied any other arrests (Tr. \n59), and provided the following account of the PSI: \nI\u2019m saying that\u2019s not what happened. The way he was asking the questions \nis not the way that that is written down. Because the way he was asking me \nthe questions is, are you sure, and I said, I\u2019m sorry, let me correct that. He \nasked me, is there anything else. And I can adamantly say, I wasn\u2019t \nreluctant but nervously saying yes there is, there was this, Okay, is there \nanything else. Still reluctantly saying, yes. Because I\u2019m nervous as hell. (Tr. \n61.) \nDuring his December 2019 PSI, Applicant expressed a belief that he does not have \nan alcohol problem. He attributed his DUI arrests to bad luck. He initially described his \ncurrent alcohol consumption as four to five 12-ounce beers within a four to five-hour \nperiod once weekly, usually on the weekends, and said that has been his drinking pattern \nbefore and after his February 2014 DUI. Later during his PSI, Applicant reportedly said \nthat he was drinking four to five beers approximately once a month. (GE 3.) Neither \nApplicant nor the investigator was asked about the discrepancy. At his June 2022 hearing, \nApplicant described his current consumption as \u201cmaybe one beer on a Friday.\u201d (Tr. 68.) \nHe explained that he drank out of habit, and that once he resumed raising animals and \ndoing his community service and other activities that he enjoys, he found his drinking \nhabit easy to break.

(Tr. 72.) Applicant admitted triggering his Interlock device in \nDecember 2019, when he consumed some alcohol-laced egg nog. (Tr. 71-72.) He was \noriginally ordered to have an Interlock device on his vehicle for two years, but it was \nextended to five years because he missed two calibrations, which each added a year, \nand he drove a vehicle without an Interlock device in July 2020, which added another \nyear. (Tr. 74-75.) \nIn October 2021, Applicant was pulled over while driving to work in a new car for \nhim. He did not have an Interlock device in the vehicle, and was charged with driving on \na suspended license. He testified that he thought he was no longer subject to the Interlock \nrequirement based on paperwork that he had and that he did not know his license had \nbeen suspended. He testified there is conflict between the Interlock device provider and \nthe state as to whether he had the device removed. He paid a fine for texting while driving \nand had the Interlock device installed (Tr. 77-78), but he is having problems with the \ndevice. He has been reported three times, most recently in about February 2022, for \nviolating the Interlock. He asserts it is due to faulty installation in that if he leaves the car \nwith the lights on, the Interlock is recorded as still being on (\u201cif you leave the lights on and \nwalk away the machine is still going and it reported him as missing a breath.\u201d). (Tr. 79-\n80.) He explained that he has not had the wiring of the device inspected because he has \nto take time from work. (Tr. 80-81.) He does not want to be accused of tampering so has \nnot tried to correct the issue. (Tr. 81.) The driving while license suspended charge is still \npending, and he has appeared four times in court on that charge. (Tr. 78.) \nApplicant performed his community service for his October 2018 DUI by providing \nassistance to a local Boy Scout troop starting in June 2020. He continued to volunteer \nafter completing his community service, and as of June 2022 he had provided over 250 \nhours. The scoutmaster attested to his completion of those hours. She has no knowledge \nof any information that would compromise Applicant\u2019s status with the scouting \norganization. (AE B.) Applicant has been a registered den leader for a Cub Scout pack \nfor the past six months. (Tr. 54-55.) \nApplicant denies any use of marijuana. He testified that he was subjected to drug \ntesting by urinalysis primarily once a month during his 13 years in the USAR, and he \nnever failed a drug screen. (Tr. 50-51.) He testified to recalling that the police found \nmarijuana \u201chidden underneath the passenger seat\u201d of his vehicle. (Tr. 64.) When \nconfronted with the police report of marijuana being in a glass jar under the driver\u2019s seat, \nApplicant responded, \u201cI thought it was under the passenger seat, but it was not my \nmarijuana.\u201d As for the police finding glass pipes with burnt marijuana in the center console \nof his vehicle, Applicant stated, \u201cThey weren\u2019t mine, so they had to have been his.\u201d (Tr. \n65.) As for the grinder found in the pocket of the driver\u2019s door, Applicant explained: \nIn the interview I stated that I gave [his former co-worker] a ride earlier and \ndropped him off at a place called [pub name omitted] where he waited for a \nride.

(Tr. 66.) \nCharacter References \nApplicant\u2019s chief union steward authored a character reference letter for Applicant \n(AE A) and also testified (Tr. 38-46.) The union steward has worked for their employer \nsince 1989 and has a secret clearance. He has been a union steward for 15 years, and \npresident and chief steward of the union \u201cgoing on seven years now.\u201d (Tr. 40-42.) He \ntestified that he did not understand until a couple of months ago that employees have a \nduty to self-report information that could affect security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 40.) The \nchief steward previously understood that it is when individuals come up for the ten-year \nreview of their clearance that they are required to be forthcoming about everything that \nhas happened understood \u201cwithin the first ten years and the second.\u201d (Tr. 39.) The chief \nsteward recalled an issue involving an employee who had an incident while intoxicated \nthat the employee reported to his supervisor and not the FSO, but he could not recall \nwhether their employer took any steps to inform employees of a duty to self-report to the \nFSO. (Tr. 43-44.) The chief steward believes that he is \u201cprobably not\u201d required to report \na union member who informs him of a legal problem, but he would advise him or her to \ninform his or her supervisor. (Tr. 44-45.) The chief steward attests that Applicant \u201chas \nbeen a model employee gaining respect of management, fellow employees, and [his] \nentire team of union officers.\u201d (AE A.) \nApplicant provided character reference letters from five co-workers (AEs C-G), \nwho attest to it being common knowledge that Applicant was arrested for DUI while on a \nroad job for their employer in 2018. A co-worker who works with Applicant on a daily basis \nrecalled hearing in 2018 about Applicant\u2019s arrest. He indicated that Applicant was \nforthright about the arrest when questioned on his return, and that Applicant was also \ncandid about his subsequent DUI. This co-worker stated that if it was common knowledge \nto notify their FSO of arrests, he would have asked Applicant if he had self-reported and \nencouraged him to do so. He asserts that Applicant has taken positive steps to better \nhimself in the last five years and requests consideration of the negative impact on \nApplicant\u2019s personal growth should he lose his clearance. (AE E.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s three DUIs establish the security concerns in AG \u00b6 22(a) (\u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child \nor spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed \nwith alcohol use disorder\u201d). He showed very poor judgment in driving under the influence \nof alcohol in October 2018 when he had a DUI charge pending from only weeks prior. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15 of the Directive, Applicant has the burden to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. AG \u00b6 23 provides for \nmitigation under the following conditions: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrate a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has minimal applicability. While there has been no recurrence of drunk-\ndriving behavior in almost four years, the passage of time is not particularly persuasive \non the issue of whether the conduct is likely to recur, given that Applicant\u2019s second and \nthird DUIs occurred more than four years after his first DUI. The recidivism of his drunk \ndriving is troubling, even if it may be said to have been infrequent. He triggered the \nInterlock device by attempting to drive after drinking as recently as December 2019. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 23(b), Applicant completed 15 alcohol-education classes after his \nFebruary 2014 DUI, which had little impact on his drinking behavior. He completed \nanother alcohol-education program after his 2018 DUIs. As of December 2019, after three \nDUIs and two alcohol-education programs, he was still drinking in the same pattern that \nexisted prior to his first DUI \u2014 four to five 12 ounce beers within four to five hours, once \nweekly, usually on the weekends. He showed little appreciation for the seriousness of his \ndrunk-driving behavior during his PSI, as he attributed his DUIs to bad luck. Applicant \nnow asserts that since starting his community service, which other evidence shows began \nin June 2020, he broke his drinking habit and consumes \u201cmaybe one beer on a Friday.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s character references do not suggest that Applicant has a drinking problem \nthat would trigger the need for treatment of the type contemplated within AG \u00b6 23(d).

Applicant has taken positive steps to minimize the \nrisk of recurrence of the alcohol consumption security concerns. Even so, the alcohol \nconsumption security concerns are not fully mitigated in light of his December 2019 \nInterlock violation and his lack of insight into the problem with drunk-driving behavior.\nThree DUIs cannot reasonably be attributed to \u201cbad luck.\u201d \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth \nin AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that, effective July 1, 2021, the possession \nand use of up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana became legal in the state where Applicant lives \nand works. However, marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law \npursuant to Title 21, Section 812 of the United States Code. Schedule I drugs are those \nwhich have a high potential for abuse; have no currently accepted medical use in \ntreatment in the United States; and lack accepted safety for use of the drug under medical \nsupervision. Section 844 under Title 21 of the United States Code makes it unlawful for \nany person to knowingly or intentionally possess a controlled substance not obtained \npursuant to a valid prescription. \nOn October 25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nguidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or \ndecriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law or the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal \nlaw pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively \nrelevant in national security determinations. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, the current DNI issued clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana, noting that prior recreational use of marijuana by an individual may \nbe relevant to security adjudications, but is not determinative in the whole-person \nevaluation. Relevant factors in mitigation include the frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur. The DNI also made clear \nthat products that contain more than 0.3 percent of THC remain illegal to use under \nfederal law and policy. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe police record of Applicant\u2019s February 2014 DUI arrest shows that some \nmarijuana and drug paraphernalia, including a grinder, were seized from his vehicle after \nhis arrest during a vehicle inventory, even though the basis of his arrest was the DUI. \nWhen confronted during his PSI about a charge of possession of less than one-half ounce \nof cannabis, first offense, Applicant recognized the charge. He admitted that he pled guilty \nand paid a fine because the drug was in his vehicle, even though he denied that he had \never used marijuana. AG \u00b6 25(c) provides as a basis for disqualification the \u201cillegal \npossession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d While he may have \nconsidered it a ticket rather than an arrest, his guilty plea is sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 \n25(c). \nApplicant\u2019s denial of any knowing possession of marijuana is difficult to believe. \nHe stated during his PSI that a co-worker, whom he transported to work on occasion, \nmust have dropped the drug in his vehicle at some point. At his hearing, he testified that, \nto his recollection, the marijuana was found under the passenger\u2019s seat. The police, who \nwere acting within the scope of their duties, reported finding a small jar with marijuana \nunder the driver\u2019s seat; two glass pipes with burnt marijuana residue in the center console; \nand a marijuana grinder in the pocket of the driver\u2019s door. Applicant provided no credible \nexplanation for how this co-worker, as a passenger during commutes to work would have \n\u201cdropped\u201d marijuana under Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s seat or put a grinder in the driver\u2019s door \nwithout Applicant\u2019s knowledge. There is considerable reason to doubt the veracity of \nApplicant\u2019s repeated denials of any marijuana use. Even so, the Government did not \nallege that Applicant used marijuana. Neither AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d nor \nAG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding \na sensitive position,\u201d can be properly considered in disqualification. \nGiven the passage of some eight years since the illegal possession and no other \nevidence of any drug involvement, AG \u00b6 26(a) has some applicability. That mitigating \ncondition states: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nWithout an acknowledgement by Applicant of any drug involvement, consideration \nof AG \u00b6 26(b) (\u201cthe individual acknowledged his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence . . . .\u201d), is not warranted. Applicant has not fully \nmitigated the drug involvement security concerns. That said, given the limited evidence \nof proven drug involvement in this case, Applicant\u2019s illegal drug possession is primarily of \nsecurity significance in assessing the criminal conduct and the personal conduct security \nconcerns. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or unwillingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s three DUI offenses and the illegal marijuana \npossession offense establish two disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31. They are: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe recidivism of Applicant\u2019s drunk driving is an aggravating factor that weighs \nagainst him under AG \u00b6 32(a) regarding whether enough time has passed to guarantee \nagainst recurrence of criminal behavior. That mitigating condition provides: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nA co-worker attests that he has witnessed the personal growth Applicant has made \nin the last five years to better his life at home and at work. The positive change in \nApplicant\u2019s drinking habits and his volunteer duties in service of the Cub Scouts are \nadditional evidence of reform with respect to the criminal conduct security concerns raised \nby his DUIs. AG \u00b6 32(d) has some applicability in this case.

He explained that there is an issue over \nwhether he had the device removed, and more recently with the wiring of the device itself, \nbut because of the pending driving on a suspended license charge, he lacks a track record \nof compliance with the law.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe Appeal Board has long held that conduct may have security significance under \nmore than one guideline and weighed differently. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 13-01281 at \n4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2014). In that regard, Applicant\u2019s DUIs and his illegal drug possession \n(SOR \u00b6 4.f) reflect questionable judgment and unreliability under AG \u00b6 15. \nApplicant is also alleged under Guideline E to have falsified his May 2017 e-QIP \nby not disclosing the February 2014 marijuana possession charge, either in response to \nthe police record inquiries (SOR \u00b6 4.a) or the drug inquiry concerning any illegal drug \ninvolvement while holding a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 4.b). Applicant denies any \nintentional concealment. During his December 2019 PSI, he stated that he forgot about \nthe drug charge. At his hearing, he testified that \u201cit was just a ticket, it wasn\u2019t an arrest. \nAnd I put that out of my mind.\u201d In analyzing an applicant\u2019s intent, I have to consider \nApplicant\u2019s answers in light of the evidence as a whole. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-\n04821 at 4 (App. Bd. May 21, 2012). \nApplicant did not provide a consistent credible explanation for how or when the \nmarijuana ended up in his vehicle. He stated during his PSI that the marijuana was \ndropped in his vehicle by a co-worker at some point and that he used to transport this co-\nworker to and from work at times. At his hearing, Applicant stated that the marijuana was \nfound under his passenger\u2019s seat. When confronted with the information in the police \nreport that the marijuana was found in a glass jar under the driver\u2019s seat, that two glass \npipes were in the center console, and that a marijuana grinder was in the driver\u2019s door \npocket, Applicant responded as follows: \nIn the interview I stated that I gave him a ride earlier and dropped him off at \na place called [pub name omitted] where he waited for a ride. I waited with \nhim, then I went home and played video games. \nFurthermore, the evidence reflects a serious reluctance on Applicant\u2019s part to \nadmit to adverse information that could hinder his clearance. As reflected in the \ninvestigator\u2019s report of Applicant\u2019s December 2019 PSI, Applicant denied that any drugs \nwere involved in his February 2014 arrest. The investigator then asked Applicant whether \nhe had been associated with illegal drugs or been arrested for using drugs and whether \nhe had any additional charges involving alcohol to report. Applicant responded negatively. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditional questioning of Applicant led to Applicant admitting his October 2018 DUI. \nHowever, after discussing that arrest, Applicant was asked, and he again denied, any \nadditional alcohol arrests and any arrests for illegal drugs or drug involvement. Applicant \nresponded negatively until he was specifically confronted about the drug charge. \nAdditional inquiry elicited an admission by Applicant of his September 2018 DUI and that \nhe had not been forthcoming during his interview about that DUI because he feared the \nnegative impact on his clearance eligibility. His repeated failure to be fully frank about his \ncriminal record when questioned during his PSI (SOR \u00b6 4.c) shows a lack of good faith \nand makes it difficult to believe that his omission of the marijuana charge from his e-QIP \nwas unintentional. \nApplicant\u2019s record of repeated misrepresentations during his PSI notwithstanding, \nthe evidence falls short of establishing a knowing failure to report his September 2018 \nDUI (SOR \u00b6 4.d) and October 2018 DUI (SOR \u00b6 4.e) to his FSO. His chief union steward \nand some co-workers indicate that it was not common knowledge to self-report any \nadverse information other than on security clearance applications completed to update \nsecurity clearance eligibility. His co-workers indicate that Applicant\u2019s 2018 DUIs were \ncommon knowledge at work. Applicant\u2019s testimony that he was unaware of any \nrequirement to inform his FSO is accepted as credible. \nThree disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 apply to the facts in this case. They \nare: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 warrant some discussion: \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) cannot reasonably apply in light of the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s \nrepeated drunk driving and his lack of candor during his December 2019 PSI. His false \ndenials of any drug arrests or additional alcohol arrests to a government investigator are \ninconsistent with the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness expected of someone \nwith clearance eligibility. The reform required under AG \u00b6 20(d) is undercut by Applicant\u2019s \nInterlock violations, a recent charge of driving on a suspended license, or by his effort to \nexplain away his lack of candor during his PSI in claiming that the questioning did not go \nas the investigator reported and he was very nervous. When taken together, Applicant\u2019s \nDUI and drug possession offenses and his lack of candor on his e-QIP and during his PSI \nsupport a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, unreliability, and \nuntrustworthiness. The security concerns about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct are not fully \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof Applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe security clearance adjudication involves evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 DUIs are not a source of pressure or vulnerability for him because they \nare common knowledge at work. He is credited with making favorable changes in his \ndrinking behavior and volunteering his time to the Scouts. Yet, for the reasons previously \ndiscussed, his reform is incomplete. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding \nan applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nor renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. \n1990). The adverse impact of a clearance decision on an applicant or his employer is not \na relevant consideration in determining national security eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 19-01759 at 3 (App. Bd. June 8, 2020) (citing ISCR Case No. 11-13180 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 21, 2013)).  For the reasons previously discussed, I am unable to find at this \ntime that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.d-4.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nElizabeth M.

On November 9, 2022, I proposed that this \ncase was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Department \nCounsel did not object. \nThis case involves seven allegations of delinquent debt (student loans) under \nGuideline F.

I believe it is \nunlikely Applicant will find herself in a similar position in the future. \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubts \nabout her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also \ngave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that she \nmet her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.

The case \nwas assigned to me on September 6, 2022. \nEvidentiary Issue \nThe FORM included a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) conducted \non January 16, 2020. (FORM Item 6.) The PSI summary was not authenticated as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was \nentitled to comment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions or updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summary on the \nground that it was not authenticated. Applicant submitted a detailed response to the \nFORM but did not comment on the accuracy or completeness of the PSI summary, nor \ndid he object to it. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summary. Although \npro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely \nand reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 71-year-old project manager employed by a defense contractor. He \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from July 1969 to April 1973. He attended \ncollege and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 1976. He participated in the U.S. Air \nForce Reserve Officers Training Corps in college, was commissioned as an Air Force \nofficer, and served on active duty until he retired in November 1993. (FORM Item 6 at 7.) \nHe has worked for defense contractors since December 2007 and for his current \nemployer since August 2008. He first received a security clearance in July 1976. \nApplicant married in February 1970 and divorced in March 1994. He married his \ncurrent spouse in April 1994. He has three adult children. \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that he failed to file federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2014 to 2018 due to a \u201cgreat increase in tax owed,\u201d which he could not afford \nto pay. He estimated that he owed $40,000 in federal taxes. (FORM Item 3 at 38.) He \nattributed the tax increase to an inheritance from his parents. (FORM Item 6 at 6.) He did \nnot provide any information about the amount or the form of the inheritance or the \ncircumstances in which the inheritance occurred. \nTax transcripts submitted by Applicant in response to DOD CAF interrogatories did \nnot include a transcript for 2014, but he admitted the debt for that tax year.

He \nobtained an extension of time and filed his 2018 return on September 9, 2019. (FORM \nItem 4 at 7-18.) \nApplicant hired a professional tax service to negotiate and settle his tax debt. In \nJune 2020, he and his wife made an installment agreement with the IRS providing for \npayments of $575 per month. (FORM Item 2 at 4.) Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM \nincluded documentary proof of the agreed payments through May 2022. (AX A.) \nApplicant was given a vacation time-share property by \u201can elderly acquaintance \nwho could not afford to maintain it.\u201d When the annual dues doubled, Applicant stopped \npaying them and took action to terminate his membership. (FORM Item 4 at 5.) A credit \nreport from December 2019 reflected a delinquent debt placed for collection of $3,631. \n(FORM Item 5 at 2.) The debt was for unpaid yearly maintenance dues. The time-share \nowner agreed to waive the past-due fees in return for a quit claim deed. Applicant \nsubmitted the quit claim deed in December 2020, and the debt was resolved. (FORM Item \n2 at 6-7.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges federal tax debts for tax years 2014 to 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.e) and \na debt to a vacation resort placed for collection of $3,631 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). The security \nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money.

A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nBecause the SOR does not allege failure to file tax returns, Applicant\u2019s failure to \ntimely file his returns for 2014 through 2018 may not be an independent basis for revoking \nhis security clearance. However, it may be considered to assess his credibility; to decide \nwhether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether he has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered Applicant\u2019s repeated \nfailures to timely file his federal income returns for these limited purposes. \nThere is no federal inheritance tax. However, income from inherited assets may \nbe taxable. The record does not reflect whether Applicant inherited assets from his \nparents, which would be non-taxable, or whether the assets he inherited generated \nincome, which would be taxable. He has not disputed the allegations, which reflect that \nthe IRS determined that he had taxable income but did not pay the taxes due. His \nadmissions and the evidence in the FORM are sufficient to establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to . . .pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established for the time-share debt, because it is unlikely that \nsomeone will give Applicant another vacation property that he cannot afford to maintain. \nIt is not established for Applicant\u2019s federal tax debts, which are recent and numerous. \nFurther inheritances are unlikely to recur, but Applicant has not provided sufficient \ninformation about the nature, source, or circumstances of the taxable income to enable \nme to determine whether recurrence of taxable income from inherited assets is unlikely \nto recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. While the death of Applicant\u2019s parents was a \ncircumstance beyond his control, he has not provided sufficient information about the \ncircumstances of the inheritance to show that the tax debt was due to a circumstance \nbeyond his control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established. Applicant resolved the time-share debt. He has obtained \nassistance from a tax professional, and the tax problem is being resolved. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) is established for the time-share debt. It is not established for the tax \ndebt. Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, \nand adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nApplicant did not demonstrate adherence to duty or obligation regarding his taxes. He \ndiscovered in 2015 that he owed substantial federal taxes, but there is no evidence that \nhe took action to resolve his tax debts until he submitted his SCA in November 2019, was \ninterviewed by a security investigator in January 2020, and realized that his tax debt was \nan impediment to continuing his security clearance. An applicant who waits until his \nclearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment and self-\ndiscipline expected of those with access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-\n01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. However, the existence of a payment arrangement with \nan appropriate tax authority does not compel a favorable decision. ISCR Case No. 17-\n03462 (App. Bd. Jun. 26, 2019). The fact that Applicant has negotiated a payment \narrangement \u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness \nbased on longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-\n05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). Applicant knew for several years that he had a tax \nproblem, but he did not act responsibly regarding his tax debt until he realized that it was \nan impediment to continuing his security clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice as well as his long record of employment by defense contractors while holding a \nsecurity clearance. I have considered that he is now complying with a payment agreement \nfor his federal income tax debts. Because he requested a determination on the record \nwithout a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on \ndemeanor or to question him about the circumstances that led to his tax debt. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent federal tax debt. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant smoked marijuana two to three times during the time period \n2012~2015, and again in 2020. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), and (c) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply. Applicant used marijuana as recently as in October of 2020. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse is found against Applicant \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nApplicant falsified his 2014 and 2020 e-QIPs. He was also less than candid in \nApplicant\u2019s 2021 interrogatories. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s lack of candor with the Government extends \nfrom 2014~2021, a period of about seven years. Personal Conduct is found against \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \ndrug involvement and substance abuse, and his personal conduct \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a~2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 40 years old. He earned an associate degree in 2012 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He married in 2018 and has two children ages 11 and 2. He has been employed as a federal contractor since 2009 and with his current employer since 2019. He lists no periods of unemployment on his security clearance application (SCA). (Item 1) The SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $113,378. Applicant attributed his financial issues to an unsuccessful real estate investment he made in 2016. He used personal loans and credit cards to make the down payment and for repairs on the property he purchased. By 2018 he was unable to make payments on the accounts and they went into collection. The accounts are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($24,093), 1.c ($18,544), 1.d ($9,807), and 1.e ($27,209). In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he states for each debt that he has been in contact with the financial institution associated with the debt to resolve it and is working on a payment plan.

The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 2 through 6. (Item 1 is the SOR) Applicant \ndid not submit a response to the FORM or file objections to any evidence offered. All \nItems are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on April 12, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He earned an associate degree in 2012 and a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2014. He married in 2018 and has two children ages 11 and 2. He has been \nemployed as a federal contractor since 2009 and with his current employer since 2019. \nHe lists no periods of unemployment on his security clearance application (SCA). (Item \n1) \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $113,378. Applicant \nattributed his financial issues to an unsuccessful real estate investment he made in 2016. \nHe used personal loans and credit cards to make the down payment and for repairs on \nthe property he purchased. By 2018 he was unable to make payments on the accounts \nand they went into collection. The accounts are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($24,093), 1.c \n($18,544), 1.d ($9,807), and 1.e ($27,209). In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he states \nfor each debt that he has been in contact with the financial institution associated with the \ndebt to resolve it and is working on a payment plan. He further stated: \nI am working on repairing all of this and I have a tangible plan that can get \nthis debt resolved within the next 2 years. I am a part-time real estate agent \nand I have been investing in single family rental properties. I plan to use the \nmoney I can earn in selling real estate and by refinancing the homes I have \npurchased to pay off the debts mentioned in the Statement of Reasons. \n(Item 2) \nRegarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant stated that this debt is an outstanding \ncar loan. He sub-leased the car to someone and that person stopped making the car \npayments and let the insurance lapse. He is unable to locate the person and the car. In \nhis September 2020 background interview with a government investigator, he stated that \nhe has been in contact with the creditor. In his answer to the SOR he said he was in touch \nwith the creditor to resolve the debt and is working on a payment plan. (Items 2, 4) \nThe debts in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to \nthe SOR, his statements to the government investigator, and credit reports from July 2020 \nand May 2021.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has five delinquent debts that began accumulating in 2016 that total \napproximately $113,378 that he is unable to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support \nthe application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted he owes all of the debts in SOR. He invested in real estate in \n2016, used personal loans and credit cards to finance the transaction and then was \nunable to make the payments on the accounts. He did not provide information as to what \nchanged and impacted his ability to pay his accounts. He indicated that he is working on \npayment plans with the creditors, but did provide any corroborating evidence. It appears \nhis plan to resolve his debts is based on his ability to make sales in the real estate market, \nrefinance some property, and use the equity to pay his debts. He did not provide any \nevidence of anything tangible he has done towards that plan. It is unknown how many \nsingle family properties Applicant owns. At this point, his plan is speculative. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unpaid and there is insufficient evidence that \nfuture issues are unlikely to recur. Applicant chose to be involved in a financial endeavor \nthat involves risk. He has not provided evidence that he is resolving his delinquent debts. \nThere is no evidence he has participated in financial counseling or that he has made a \ngood-faith effort to repay his creditors. None of the above mitigating conditions apply to \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is for a defaulted car loan. He subleased the car to someone \nwho then failed to make the payments. This was a risky transaction, but was marginally \nbeyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He has not provided evidence that he has a \npayment plan or settlement agreement with the creditor. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 57 years old. From 1985 through 1988, he served honorably in the United States Air Force. He has been married and divorced twice, most recently divorced in 2007. He has three adult sons. Since June 2015, he has worked for a government contractor as an aircraft supervisor. (Item 2) The SOR alleges that Applicant has been arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) five times, prior to December 2019, and one alcohol-related disorderly conduct violation. All of his alcohol-related misconduct was cross-alleged under Guideline J, and an additional 1998 charge of obtaining a hunting license under false pretenses was also alleged. All of his alcohol-related and criminal conduct SOR allegations were cross- alleged under Guideline E. Applicant admitted the December 2019 arrest, in which he was charged with Extreme DUI and had a blood alcohol content (BAC) above .20%. (SOR \u00b61.a) He admitted a June 2015 DUI charge with a BAC between .12 and .15%. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He stated both of these incidents occurred after he had been golfing with friends and drinking alcohol. He generally consumes between eight and twelve beers during each golf outing. He pleaded guilty to the 2015 DUI, and he was ordered by the court to complete three months of counseling, fined approximately $2,000, and required to install an interlock device on his vehicle for one year. He also pleaded guilty to the December 2019 DUI charge, and the court sentenced him to serve two days ",

From 1985 through 1988, he served honorably in the \nUnited States Air Force. He has been married and divorced twice, most recently divorced \nin 2007. He has three adult sons. Since June 2015, he has worked for a government \ncontractor as an aircraft supervisor. (Item 2) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has been arrested and charged with driving under \nthe influence (DUI) five times, prior to December 2019, and one alcohol-related disorderly \nconduct violation. All of his alcohol-related misconduct was cross-alleged under Guideline \nJ, and an additional 1998 charge of obtaining a hunting license under false pretenses was \nalso alleged. All of his alcohol-related and criminal conduct SOR allegations were cross-\nalleged under Guideline E. \nApplicant admitted the December 2019 arrest, in which he was charged with \nExtreme DUI and had a blood alcohol content (BAC) above .20%. (SOR \u00b61.a) He \nadmitted a June 2015 DUI charge with a BAC between .12 and .15%. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He \nstated both of these incidents occurred after he had been golfing with friends and drinking \nalcohol. He generally consumes between eight and twelve beers during each golf outing. \nHe pleaded guilty to the 2015 DUI, and he was ordered by the court to complete three \nmonths of counseling, fined approximately $2,000, and required to install an interlock \ndevice on his vehicle for one year. He also pleaded guilty to the December 2019 DUI \ncharge, and the court sentenced him to serve two days in jail, 22 days of work release, \nand 96 hours of home detention. He completed alcohol screening, attended DUI classes, \nand he paid a fine of approximately $3,700.

(SOR Answer; GE 2-GE 13) \nDuring a background interview in July 2019, Applicant discussed in detail his \nalcohol-related charges with an authorized government investigator. He also described \nhis general pattern of drinking as consuming four to eight beers at home on the weekends. \nWhen questioned about the likelihood that he would consume alcohol to the point where \nhe once again faced adverse consequences, Applicant\u2019s reply was that it would never \nhappen. He stated that he made a conscious decision to not consume alcohol to excess \nin the future. In the event he was out drinking socially, he would use the services of an \nride-share service to prevent another DUI. Five months after this interview, Applicant was \narrested in December 2019 for DUI with a blood alcohol content above .20%. (GE 4) \nApplicant admitted that he had consumed alcohol, at times to excess, from about \nDecember 1990 to at least December 2019. In April 2021, he was diagnosed by a treating \nphysician as having an alcohol use disorder. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h) \nDuring his November 2020 background interview, Applicant stated that drinking \nalcohol makes him happy. Since his last arrest for DUI in December 2019, he decided he \nwould abstain completely from using alcohol. In November 2021, he certified that the \ndetails reported during his attached background interviews were accurate and true. (SOR \nAnswer; GE 4) \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b) Applicant admitted that he was found guilty of obtaining a hunting \nlicense under false pretenses in December 1998. (SOR Answer) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, licensed clinical social worker) \nof alcohol use disorder. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), (c), and (d). Applicant was involved \nin six alcohol-related arrests in 1990, 1991, 1995, 1999, 2015, and 2019. During his most \nrecent arrest, his BAC recording was extremely high, registering over 0.20% indicative of \na binge consumption of alcohol. In April 2021, he was diagnosed with an alcohol use \ndisorder by a qualified medical or mental health professional. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations \nTo his credit, Applicant candidly admitted in his SOR Answer his involvement in \nthe six alcohol-related incidents, and he acknowledged his 2021 diagnosis of alcohol use \ndisorder. His long track record of repeated criminal and alcohol-related offenses \ndemonstrates extremely poor judgment and an inability to control impulses. It is clear that \nhe did not learn from his past mistakes. When interviewed in July 2019, Applicant told the \ninvestigator that there was no chance of him ever facing adverse consequences in the \nfuture due to his excessive use of alcohol. He was arrested for DUI with an extremely \nhigh BAC five months following this background interview. \nThere is insufficient information in the record to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s claim that \nhe has successfully abstained from using alcohol since his most recent DUI arrest in \nDecember 2019. There is no information about his alcohol treatment following his 2021 \ndiagnosis of alcohol use disorder, details of his rehabilitation, or even a future favorable \nprognosis. Due to the severity of Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse history, I believe more time is \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nneeded to establish successful rehabilitation. Applicant failed to mitigate the alcohol \nconsumption security concerns. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One potentially applies: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.  \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 31(a). Applicant was involved in six alcohol-\nrelated arrests from 1990 through 2019, and in 1998, he was found guilty of obtaining a \nhunting license under false pretenses. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is disconcerting. His long pattern of criminal violations \ndemonstrates that he holds himself above the law. There is insufficient evidence in the \nrecord concerning his successful rehabilitation, or to demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s criminal \nconduct will not recur. I find that more time is needed to ensure that he does not repeat \nhis excessive use of alcohol and engage in criminal conduct. As such, his behavior \ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant \nfailed to establish mitigation under the above mitigating conditions. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) personal conduct\u2026 that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as  \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \nGuideline J allegation \u00b6 2.b and Guideline G allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, \nand 1.f are cross-alleged under Guideline E \u00b6 3.a. Each of them is established by the \nrecord evidence. Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse and seven criminal arrests support \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e)(1). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s claim that he has abstained from drinking alcohol since December \n2019 is laudable. As stated under Guideline G, there is insufficient information in the \nrecord concerning his successful treatment and rehabilitation following an April 2021 \ndiagnosis of alcohol use disorder. In addition, not enough time has elapsed to show that \nhe is fully rehabilitated or that criminal conduct is unlikely to recur, which continues to cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, J, and E \nand the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant acknowledged his lapses in judgment due to his excessive use of alcohol \nand a long history of criminal and alcohol-related violations. This pattern demonstrated \nthat he was unable to learn from his mistakes and he places his personal interests before \nhis legal obligations and responsibilities. He also failed to provide supporting \ndocumentation concerning his alcohol counseling and treatment following a 2021 \ndiagnosis of alcohol use disorder. I cannot determine if he has successfully completed \ntreatment and if he has fully complied with the treatment recommendations. Given the \nentirety of the record evidence, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the alcohol \nconsumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

On October 6, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec.

After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in March 2015 \nand served on active duty until he was honorably discharged in July 2017. He was granted \na secret clearance in 2015 following a favorable eligibility determination. (Item 7) He was \nmarried in 2012, separated in 2019, and subsequently divorced. He reportedly has two \nchildren. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 1 (Answer to the SOR, dated October 26, \n2021); Item 2 (SF 86, dated February 25, 2021); Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, \ndated April 20, 2021); Item 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit \nReport, dated May 28, 2014); Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax \nCredit Report, dated March 20, 2021); and Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated August \n30, 2021). \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having some financial issues. He listed \nsome delinquent medical bills and a cable bill, and he stated that he \u201ccannot afford to pay \nat this time.\u201d (Item 2 at 45-53) On April 30, 2021, he was interviewed by an investigator \nwith the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, he described \nhis delinquent accounts and claimed that two factors contributed to his financial \ndifficulties: his separation; and his periods of unemployment. He said he prioritized his \naccounts and was trying to satisfy living expenses. The investigator requested that he \nfurnish financial documentation to support his claims, but he did not do so. (Item 3 at 4) \nIn fact, Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties predate his marital separation. In July 2015, \nhe acknowledged that he had delinquent educational loans that were in forbearance until \nOctober 2015, as well as delinquent medical bills, and commercial accounts. Based on \nthe documentary evidence reflecting positive actions in addressing those accounts that \nhe furnished the Department of Defense (DOD) CAF, the predecessor of the DCSA CAF, \nhe was determined to be eligible for a secret security clearance. (Item 7) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant modified the factors that contributed to his \nfinancial difficulties. He listed financial hardship; loss of employment during the pandemic; \nand his divorce. He stated that his plan was to earn money \u201ccontracting\u201d to enable him to \nfulfill his financial obligations. (Item 7 at 3) Applicant made no statements that he had \ncontacted his creditors, established repayment agreements, or made any payments. \nThe SOR alleged 14 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,425, as \nset forth below: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f., 1.h., and 1.i. are medical accounts with unpaid balances \nof $62, $62, $61, $46, $741, $50, $61, and $61 that were placed for collection. (Item 3 at \n33-4; Item 5 at 4-8; Item 6 at 1-2) The accounts have not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. is an insurance account with an unpaid balance of $252 that was \nplaced for collection. (Item 3 at 4; Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at 2) The account has not been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j., 1.m., and 1.n. are Internet or cellular telephone accounts with unpaid \nbalances of $171, $329, and $156 that were placed for collection. (Item 3 at 3-4; Item 5 \nat 5-6; Item 6 at 2) The accounts have not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $21,974 that was \nplaced for collection and charged off. (Item 3 at 3; Item 5 at4; Item 6 at 4) The account \nhas not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. is a power-utility account with an unpaid balance of $399 that was \nplaced for collection and charged off. (Item 6 at 4) The account has not been resolved. \nWhile Applicant contended that he had attended a few seminars and workshops \nregarding repairing credit, he did not identify the sources of those sessions, when they \nwere conducted, or any other features of the training.

Applicant did not report his net monthly income, \nhis monthly household expenses, or any monthly debt payments (for even the most \ninsignificant of his delinquent debts). In the absence of such information, I am unable to \ndetermine if he has any monthly remainder available for savings or spending. There is a \npaucity of evidence to indicate that his financial problems are now under control, and it is \ndifficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged 14 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,425. \nApplicant attributed his inability to maintain those accounts in a current status to several \nfactors: financial hardship; loss of employment during the pandemic; his separation; and \nhis divorce. However, as noted above, his financial difficulties existed before 2015. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has \nbeen unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has \nnot been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. In 2016, \nApplicant transitioned from a full-time job to a part-time job, reportedly because of a work-\nrelated injury in 2014, and it raises the possibility of a business downturn that might have \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeen largely beyond his control. However, without describing his actual income during \nthe period 2014 through 2021, and without more information, it is impossible to determine \nwhat the financial impact may have been. He offered no evidence that his salary was \nreduced because of the change in employment. It is clear that he either completely \nstopped paying child support or that he reduced his payments, causing two separate \nchild-support arrearages of substantial amounts. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Although Applicant claimed that he had been making child \nsupport payments and expected his health insurance to cover two relatively modest \nmedical bills, he offered no documentary evidence of a good-faith effort to support any of \nthose claims. Between the date he received the SOR in 2020 and the date his response \nto the FORM was expected in 2021, he made no claimed or verifiable efforts to address \nany of the delinquent debts. \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.).

Applicant\u2019s failures to register for the SSS or list \nany of his delinquent debts in his SF 86 will be considered only for the five purposes listed \nabove.  \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant actually ignored his delinquent \naccounts for a substantial multi-year period. Because of his failure to confirm payment of \neven his smallest delinquent account (a $512 internet or cellular telephone account) and \nhis failure to furnish documentation regarding any of the accounts, the overwhelming \nevidence leads to the conclusion that his financial problems are not under control. He has \nnot acted responsibly by failing to address his delinquent accounts while employed and \nby failing to make limited, if any, efforts of working with his creditors. The Appeal Board \nhas previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties.

Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant has failed to offer any evidence that he has even begun making such efforts \neven after the SOR was issued in July 2020. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered no specifics \nregarding any repayment efforts; submitted no documentary evidence to reflect any \npayments made; and only made promises of proposed actions. Not one delinquent debt \nhas been resolved. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, and his \ngeneral failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them until substantial investigatory \naction was taken, is sufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent. \nThe timeliness of his efforts to resolve his debts is not good, and the delay in commencing \nto do so, is another negative factor. The subsequent positive and successful efforts are \ngood. However, the source of the funds he used to resolve his delinquent accounts is still \nshrouded in mystery. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a non-federal company but is sponsored by a \ndefense contractor. He has been serving as a part-time fry cook with his current employer \nsince November 2017. He was previously employed by other employers as a part-time \nhome improvement helper (June 2016 \u2013 November 2017) and a full-time security officer \n(September 2010 \u2013 June 2016). He is a 2000 high school graduate with a general \neducation development (GED) diploma. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant omitted, concealed, or falsified his financial history \nin his SF 86. He failed to timely register with the SSS before he turned 26. He has seven \nstill-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $98,313. That amount includes \nsubstantial child-support arrearages for two children. Although he claimed that he had \nbeen making child-support payments; and he expected his health insurance to handle \ntwo medical debts, he offered no documentary evidence of a good-faith effort to support \nany of those claims. \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s failure to confirm any payments, and his failure to furnish \ndocumentation regarding any of the accounts, the overwhelming evidence leads to the \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconclusion that his financial problems are not under control. He has not acted responsibly \nby failing to address his delinquent accounts while employed and by failing to make \nlimited, if any, efforts of working with his creditors. There are lingering questions if \nApplicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been, as well as \ncontinuing doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero verifiable efforts to resolve the debts, and the \nlengthy period of non-contact with his creditors, is negative and disappointing. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. His unalleged conduct merely adds to those \nquestions and doubts. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 36 years old, unmarried, and with no children. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 2009 until November 2018, when he was honorably discharged. From December 2018, he has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item 2.) In his Answer, Applicant explained that when he left the Navy in November 2018 and became employed by a defense contractor, he took a pay cut. In addition, his job required long periods at sea. While at sea, he had limited Internet connectivity and only DSN (Defense Switched Network) phone service. That made it difficult for him to contact his creditors. When he is shipboard, he is able to save money as his room and board are paid. His plan is to save funds and pay his debts in full, which he \u201cwas able to do with most.\u201d At the time of his December 2021 Answer, he had been at sea since mid- September 2021. (Item 1A.) In his October 15, 2019 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), he responded as follows when asked about his financial situation: Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has 10 delinquent debts totaling $43,230. (Item 1S.) The Government\u2019s credit reports support those allegations. The SOR debts were incurred between 2018 and 2020. (Items 4 through 7.) Applicant admitted those allegations, with explanations that are discussed below. (Item 1A.) SOR \u00b6 1.a. is a credit card account char",

The case \nwas assigned to me on September 6, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old, unmarried, and with no children. He served on active \nduty in the U.S. Navy from February 2009 until November 2018, when he was honorably \ndischarged. From December 2018, he has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item \n2.) In his Answer, Applicant explained that when he left the Navy in November 2018 and \nbecame employed by a defense contractor, he took a pay cut. In addition, his job required \nlong periods at sea. While at sea, he had limited Internet connectivity and only DSN \n(Defense Switched Network) phone service. That made it difficult for him to contact his \ncreditors. When he is shipboard, he is able to save money as his room and board are \npaid. His plan is to save funds and pay his debts in full, which he \u201cwas able to do with \nmost.\u201d At the time of his December 2021 Answer, he had been at sea since mid-\nSeptember 2021. (Item 1A.) \nIn his October 15, 2019 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), he responded as follows \nwhen asked about his financial situation: \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has 10 delinquent debts totaling \n$43,230. (Item 1S.) The Government\u2019s credit reports support those allegations. The SOR \ndebts were incurred between 2018 and 2020. (Items 4 through 7.) Applicant admitted \nthose allegations, with explanations that are discussed below. (Item 1A.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is a credit card account charged off for $14,267. (Item 1S.) Applicant \nexplained that this account is being paid by a voluntary wage garnishment that has \nreduced the balance to $10,959. The September 15, 2021 wage garnishment documents \nshow the total balance due of $14,410, with no reduction of the balance due.

This debt has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a collection account charged off for $12,157. (Item 1S.) Applicant \nexplained that he has a payment plan for $1,000 per month. His document shows one \npayment of $1,000 on November 17, 2021. (Item 1A.) In his Response, his document \nshows six monthly payments from November 2021 to March 2022 that total the amount \nalleged in the SOR. (Response.) This debt has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a credit card account charged off for $3,165. (Item 1S.) Applicant \nexplained that he \u201ctried contacting via email but was not given the option to do so.\u201d  He \nintended to pay in full once he is off sea duty. (1A.)

(Item 1S.) Applicant \nexplained that he contacted the collection agency and was told it no longer had that \naccount. His document advised him that the account had been returned to the original \ncreditor. (Item 1A.) In his Response, he stated that the original creditor had no records of \nthis account and that the matter was closed. (Response.) This debt has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. is a judgment charged off for $4,188. (Item 1S.) Applicant explained \nthat this judgment was paid in full. His documents show that this judgment was paid in full \non November 20. 2021. (Item1A.) This debt has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. is a bank account placed for collection for $4,082. (Item 1S.)

(Item 1A.) In his Response, his document \nshows that this debt was paid in full on June 24, 2022. (Response.) \nUnder Guideline E, SOR \u00b6 2.a. alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose in his SCA the delinquent accounts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e. (Item 1S.) \nApplicant did not disclose any of the SOR debts in his SCA. (Item 2.) He admitted this \nallegation as follows: \n[T]his was uncharacteristic of me. I was confronted with the facts and \ntold my investigator/interviewer. I know I made a mistake and I deeply regret \nit. I believe I had a lapse in judgment when I did this. I was overwhelmed, \nembarrassed, and scared of what may happen if I lost my job. I understand \nthat that is not grounds to hold any information and it\u2019s no excuse. (Item \n1A.)  \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n   Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the Government\u2019s credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(b) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts arose in the 2018 to 2020 timeframe. And they remained in \ndefault at the time the SOR was issued. So, these debts did not arise that long ago. Also, \nthese debts were not infrequent. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to mitigate these debts   \nMitigating factor AG \u00b6 20(b) has two principal elements. First, there must be \n\u201cconditions\u201d \u201clargely beyond the [applicant\u2019s] control\u201d that caused the financial problem. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSecond. The [applicant] must have \u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d that he \nwas confronting. \nIn this case, Applicant faced several challenges when he was honorably \ndischarged from the Navy. Initially, he took a pay cut, when he gained employment in the \nprivate sector. When he did find employment, the job required lengthy tours at sea. Next, \nbeing at sea made Internet and telephone connections with his creditors difficult. In \naddition, he was only paid while he was serving shipboard. The record shows that during \nat least one foreign port call, he contacted several creditors but was unable to accomplish \nany debt resolution. The foregoing conditions were \u201clargely beyond\u201d Applicant\u2019s control, \nthus satisfying the first element of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe next inquiry is whether Applicant acted responsibly under those adverse \ncircumstances. In this case, he took advantage of serving at sea and having his room and \nboard provided at no cost. This benefit allowed him to save a fund to pay his creditors \nwhen he returned to shore. That in itself was responsible conduct. But when he did return \nfrom his shipboard deployment, he promptly resolved nine of his ten SOR debts by paying \nthem in full. He paid four of those in November 2021, two in December 2021, and three \nin early to mid-2022. That conduct is responsible debt management. The second element \nof AG \u00b6 20(b) is satisfied. Applicant\u2019s SOR debts are mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the \nallegation and applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). Under Guideline E for personal \nconduct, the concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d A statement is false or dishonest when it is made deliberately (knowingly \nand willfully). \nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified facts by failing to disclose his \nfinancial delinquencies his financial difficulties in his SCA. He unqualifiedly admitted that \nallegation. This conduct falls squarely within AG \u00b6 16(a), which states in pertinent part: \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations.  \nAG \u00b6 17(a) states in pertinent part a mitigating condition that may mitigate that \ndisqualifying condition: \n[The] individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nIn this case, after falsifying by omission his SCA, Applicant\u2019s next opportunity to \ncorrect that omission was during the PSI. In that interview, he was asked an open-ended \nquestion about his \u201cfinancial situation.\u201d He answered that it was \u201cgood\u201d but volunteered \nthat he was \u201cnot meeting all his financial obligations on time.\u201d He then further volunteered \nthat his pay cut gave him a \u201chard time\u201d paying his debts. Without any prompting, he spoke \nabout three credit card debts that were in default and volunteered that he had other \naccounts in default but could not recall them. So far, in this exchange, he spoke truthfully \nwithout any prompting or confrontation. It was only after he professed no recollection of \nthe specific other accounts in default that the investigator confronted Applicant with details \nof the other accounts. The PSI was conducted on October 15, 2019, over two years before \nthe SOR was issued. So, Applicant was testifying about his defaulted accounts by \nmemory, until being refreshed by the investigator about accounts that would eventually \nbe in the SOR. \nOn this record, Applicant used the first opportunity afforded by the security \nclearance process to rectify his omissions in the SCA. He did so without having seen the \nSOR or being confronted by the investigator. I find that Applicant mitigated his omission \nunder AG \u00b6 17(a). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline \nE in my whole-person analysis. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 45 years old, divorced and remarried. He has three children by his former wife, ages 20, 17, and 14, who live with his former wife. Applicant has three stepchildren, ages 18, 16, and 15, who live with him and his current wife. He was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in December 2005. Applicant served on active duty in the Air Force from April 2000 until he retired in May 2020 with an honorable discharge. The SOR alleged eight delinquent debts that total $20,963 and one foreclosed mortgage in 2014. Applicant admitted the allegations. More specifically, he answered that two debts will be paid (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c.) and one debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) has been paid.

He was afforded 30 days after receiving the \nFORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM. The SOR and the Answer (Items 1 and 2) are \nthe pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 10 are admitted without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on March 23, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 45 years old, divorced and remarried. He has three children by his \nformer wife, ages 20, 17, and 14, who live with his former wife. Applicant has three \nstepchildren, ages 18, 16, and 15, who live with him and his current wife. He was awarded \nan associate\u2019s degree in December 2005. Applicant served on active duty in the Air Force \nfrom April 2000 until he retired in May 2020 with an honorable discharge. \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent debts that total $20,963 and one foreclosed \nmortgage in 2014. Applicant admitted the allegations. More specifically, he answered that \ntwo debts will be paid (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c.) and one debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) has been paid. \nApplicant attributes the other debts to his separation and divorce from his first wife (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.e. \u2013 1.i.). He did not produce any documents supporting his responses. \n(Answer.) Applicant did aver that the foreclosure (SOR \u00b61.i.) had no balance due to the \nmortgagee. The Government\u2019s evidence supports that assertion. (Item 8.) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \nGovernment\u2019s credit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies occurred recently and persist to this day. I cannot find \nthat AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. The next inquiry is whether AG \u00b6 20(b) applies.  \nMarital separations and divorces, especially where children are involved, are fertile \nfields where financial problems can grow. It is not unreasonable, therefore, for Applicant \nto claim that his separation and divorce caused the financial problems that he confronts \ntoday. Separation and divorce are conditions expressly recognized by AG \u00b6 20(b) as \nbeing \u201clargely beyond [a] person\u2019s control.\u201d The inquiry, however, does not end there. \nFaced with the financial adversity that separation and divorce cause, Applicant needs to \nshow that he acted responsibly under those circumstances. He has not done so here. In \naddition, Applicant has not produced any documents to support his claims that SOR debts \nhave been or will be paid. The Appeal Board has stated that it is reasonable for a Judge \nto expect applicants to present documentation showing that debts have been resolved or \nare being resolved. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008). AG \n\u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n  \n                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n    Subparagraphs 1.a.- 1.i.:  \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n  Against Applicant  \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports establish disqualifying \nconditions under the guidelines: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and 19(c) \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted that he is responsible for his debts and intends to pay them. \nHowever, he did not present any evidence to support that he acted responsibly and in \ngood-faith to repay his financial obligations, or has a meaningful track record of \nrepayments. Based on the lack of evidence produced by Applicant, it is difficult to \nconclude he made a sufficient good-faith effort and to conclude that he has the requisite \njudgement, reliability, or trustworthiness needed to have access to classified \ninformation. He has not met his burden and none of the mitigating conditions apply. Any \ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the military for 22 years and \nreceived an honorable discharge. He did not provide any documentation concerning \nresolution of his delinquent debt. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F \nin my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He has not provided evidence to meet his \nburden of proof. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Item 2 at 62) One month later, on \nDecember 30, 2020, he was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). During that interview, he acknowledged that as a result \nof his 2014 divorce, and an inability to maintain his accounts in a current status, a number \nof accounts became delinquent. (Item 6 at 11-13) In his Answers to the Interrogatories, \nhe admitted that three of the four accounts identified in the interrogatories had still not \nbeen paid. (Item 3 at 36-37) He added that the debts were incurred in his name during \nhis former marriage. As a result of the divorce, he was left with several debts in particular, \nand he could not pay them at the time. Over the ensuing years, despite various collection \nefforts by the creditors and collection agencies, because Applicant was rebuilding his life \nand initially could not pay the debts, on the advice of an attorney, he decided to allow the \nstatute of limitations to run so that he would be no longer legally liable for the debts. In \n2019, he contacted one of his creditors, the holder of two separate debts, in an effort to \nreach a settlement compromise, but they could not reach a settlement. The creditor \noffered to settle those accounts for 55 per cent of the unpaid balance, but Applicant was \nonly willing to pay 25 per cent. (Item 3 at 42) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant restated his earlier position. He and his \nattorney noted that the most recent payments for his delinquent debts occurred in 2014, \nand the statute of limitations had run freeing him from legal liability for the debts. He also \nsubmitted a credit report, dated October 22, 2021, that indicated several of his debts \nwould be removed from his credit report during 2021-2022. (Exhibit A) On November 16, \n2021, Applicant requested Equifax to place a security freeze on his credit file denying \naccess to the report. (Item 5 (Request for Security Freeze, dated November 16, 2021) \nThe SOR alleged three still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $21,797, \nas set forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is a bank credit-card account with an unpaid balance of approximately \n$14,702 that was placed for collection and charged off. Applicant used the card to pay for \nfamily and school expenses while married to his first wife. (Item 4 at 4; Item 6 at 11) Other \nthan his earlier unsuccessful efforts to have the creditor reduce the balance to 25 per \ncent, he has refused to pay the unpaid balance despite now having the ability to do so. \nThe account no longer appears in his most recent credit reports. (Exhibit D (Statement, \ndated December 11, 2021); Exhibit E (TransUnion Credit Report, dated December 11, \n2021); Exhibit F (Experian Credit Report, dated December 11, 2021); Exhibit G (Equifax \nCredit Report, dated December 11, 2021) While the statute of limitations may have run, \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand the account is no longer being reported in his credit reports, the account remains \nunresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a bank line of credit with an unpaid balance of $3,579 that was placed \nfor collection and charged off. Applicant used the account to pay for a relocation in 2005 \nand subsequent family expenses while married to his first wife. (Item 4 at 5; Item 6 at 11) \nOther than his earlier unsuccessful efforts to have the creditor reduce the balance, he has \nrefused to pay the unpaid balance despite now having the ability to do so. The account \nno longer appears in his most recent credit reports. (Exhibit D; Exhibit E; Exhibit F; Exhibit \nG) While the statute of limitations may have run, and the account is no longer being \nreported in his credit reports, the account remains unresolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a bank credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $3,516 that \nwas placed for collection and charged off. Applicant used the card to pay for family \nexpenses while married to his first wife. (Item 4 at 5; Item 6 at 11-12) He has refused to \npay the unpaid balance despite now having the ability to do so. The account no longer \nappears in his most recent credit reports. (Exhibit D; Exhibit E; Exhibit F; Exhibit G) While \nthe statute of limitations may have run, and the account is no longer being reported in his \ncredit reports, the account remains unresolved. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to describe with \nany specificity Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. He only submitted his Fair Isaac \nCorporation (FICO) scores reported by the three credit reporting agencies: 715; 715; and \n739. He offered no explanation as to the significance or meaning of such scores. (Exhibit \nE; Exhibit F; Exhibit G) Applicant did not report his net monthly income, his monthly \nhousehold expenses, or any monthly debt payments. In the absence of such information, \nI am unable to determine if he has any monthly remainder available for savings or \nspending. There is a paucity of evidence to indicate that his financial problems are now \nunder control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been, or if he has the funds available to pay his debts but is simply \nchoosing not to do so.  \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4.

Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.

Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged three still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $21,797. \nApplicant acknowledged that as a result of his 2014 divorce, and an inability at that time \nto maintain his accounts in a current status, a number of accounts became delinquent. \nBecause he was in the process of rebuilding his life with his new wife, on the advice of an \nattorney, he decided to allow the statute of limitations to run so that he would be no longer \nlegally liable for the debts. Instead of accepting his financial responsibilities and resolving \nthose debts \u2013 debts incurred by him in receiving things of benefit from the creditors while \nmarried to his first wife \u2013 he chose to ignore those debts. In 2019, one creditor of two \nseparate debts offered to settle those accounts for 55 per cent of the unpaid balance, but \nApplicant was only willing to pay 25 per cent. No resolution was reached. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) have been established because of Applicant\u2019s previous inability to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has been established because of his subsequent \nunwillingness to satisfy them regardless of his ability to do so. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s \ndivorce from his first wife occurred in 2014. In 2019, one creditor of two separate debts \noffered to settle those accounts for 55 per cent of the unpaid balance, but Applicant was \nonly willing to pay 25 per cent. No resolution was reached. With the exception of that one \nexchange, he never initiated any good-faith efforts to repay his overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve his debts, for his most recent payments occurred in 2014. Instead, he \nignored his creditors and waited for the statute of limitations to run to free him from legal \nliability for the debts. The accounts no longer appear in his credit reports. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Jul. 7, 2016) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first \ndate of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. (Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission \nwebsite, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf.) Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. Applicant\u2019s failure to provide a plan \nto resolve the charged-off debts on the credit report makes it difficult to find mitigation of \nthose debts in this case. \nThe statute of limitations clearly and unequivocally ends an Applicant\u2019s legal \nresponsibility to pay the creditors after the passage of a certain amount of time, as \nspecified in state law. In a series of decisions, the Appeal Board has rejected the statute \nof limitations for debts generated through contracts, which is the law in all 50 states, as \nautomatically mitigating financial considerations concerns under AG \u00b6 20(d). (See ISCR \nCase No. 08-01122 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18. 2007); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd.

Dec. 29, \n2008)). \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant has effectively ignored his \ndelinquent accounts since 2014 essentially because he wanted to rebuild his life with his \nnew wife while placing his actions and activities, as well as his debts incurred during his \nrelationship with his ex-wife, into the forgotten past. While he may not be legally liable for \nthose delinquent debts because of the statute of limitations, and those debts may have \nbeen removed from his credit reports, Applicant has not acted responsibly by failing to \naddress those delinquent accounts while employed and by failing to make limited, if any, \nefforts of working with his creditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented on \nsuch a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties.

(See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant reportedly made only one effort in 2019 to pay only 25 per cent of an unpaid \nbalance to one creditor after years of ignoring that creditor. And now, because of the \nstatute of limitations, and the clean credit report, he contends that he is free from any \nfurther obligations regarding his debts. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant chose to ignore his \ndelinquent debts for a number of years and was eventually able to pass the threshold of \nthe statute of limitations. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current financial \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s actions or in-action under the circumstances cast significant \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. \n09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nsenior electrical engineer with his current employer since October 2020. He was \npreviously employed by other companies as a senior electrical engineer (April 2019 \u2013 \nOctober 2020); senior hardware engineer (February 1999 \u2013 January 2019); and part-time \nas an adjunct professor with a community college (August 2008 \u2013 June 2013). He \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1991 and a master\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering in 2005, both from a foreign university, and has been attending an \nAmerican university on an infrequent basis over the years, but has not received any other \ndegree. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has three still-delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $21,797. As a result of his 2014 divorce, and an inability at that time to \nmaintain his accounts in a current status, a number of accounts became delinquent. \nBecause he was in the process of rebuilding his life with his new wife, on the advice of an \nattorney, he decided to allow the statute of limitations to run so that he would be no longer \nlegally liable for the debts. Instead of accepting his financial responsibilities and resolving \nthose debts \u2013 debts incurred by him in receiving things of benefit from the creditors while \nmarried to his first wife \u2013 he chose to ignore those debts. In 2019, one creditor of two \nseparate debts offered to settle those accounts for 55 per cent of the unpaid balance, but \nApplicant was only willing to pay 25 per cent. No resolution was reached. He has not \nacted responsibly by failing to address his delinquent accounts while employed and by \nfailing to make limited, if any, efforts of working with his creditors over a multi-year period. \nIt remains unclear why Applicant requested that Equifax place a security freeze on his \ncredit file denying access to the report. There are lingering questions if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than he had been, as well as continuing doubt \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of only one limited effort in 2019 to resolve any of his \ndelinquent debts, and the lengthy period of non-contact with his creditors since 2014, is \nnegative and disappointing. Moreover, his willful decision to ignore his debts until the \nstatute of limitations had passed leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

(Items 5-8) \nSince September 2021, Applicant has been working to pay off his delinquent \naccounts. In February 2022, he paid off his student loan indebtedness with a lump sum \npayment of $9,480. (Item 9) But while he is was able to resolve two of his remaining \nthree consumer debts (i.e., SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f) with pay-offs, he has not addressed his \nremaining consumer debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) This account remains unresolved at this time. \nApplicant reported joint monthly income of $7,004. (Item 6) He reported monthly \nexpenses of $6,561 and a net monthly remainder of $39. (Item 6) \nBecause there is a lack of documented information from Applicant in the record \nto assess his income tax filing status for tax years 2017 and 2018, and the remaining \ndelinquent debt (covered by SOR \u00b61.c), no favorable inferences can be drawn as to \nwhether he will be able to resolve his remaining financial issues in the foreseeable \nfuture. Based on the absence of sufficient evidence of tax filing and payment history, \nApplicant\u2019s prospects for addressing his delinquent tax filing and payment issues are \nuncertain at best. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. The AG guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                         Financial Considerations \n \n          The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, \nand thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personal \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is  \nalso a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage.

Additional security concerns are raised over applicant\u2019s \naccumulation of delinquent student loan and consumer debts. On the strength of the \nevidence presented, two disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines (DCs) \nfor financial considerations apply to Applicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admitted tax-filing lapses and debt delinquencies require no \nindependent proof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick \non Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted debt delinquencies are fully documented \nand create judgment issues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004) \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation is required to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security \nclearance that entitles the person to access classified and sensitive information. While \nthe principal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties \nis vulnerability to coercion to classified information or to holding sensitive position, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \nHistorically, the timing and resolving of tax-filing failures and debt delinquencies \nare critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability and good \njudgment in following rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary for those seeking \naccess to classified ad sensitive information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR \nCase No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016; ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties associated with his still \nunresolved delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6 1.c) raise considerable concerns over his ability to \nmanage his finances in a responsible and reliable way.  \nBased on the information Applicant furnished, extenuating circumstances played \nno material role in Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent accounts. Gainfully employed \nfor many years, he provided little documentation as to how he budgeted and addressed \nhis tax-filing responsibilities and debt management before receiving the SOR in 2021. \nWhy he did not begin to address his delinquent accounts in a material way with the \nresources available to him prior to receiving the SOR response is unclear. With so little \nfinancial information to work with relative to the circumstances prompting him to fall \nbehind with his tax-filing obligations and taking care of his student loans and other \naccounts with the income resources available to him, no meaningful extenuation or \nmitigation credit can be assigned to him at this time. \nTo date, Applicant has neither filed his federal income taxes for tax years 2017-\n2018, nor resolved his remaining delinquent consumer debt.

Based on \nApplicant\u2019s failure to date to establish a meaningful track record of timely filing of his \nfederal income tax returns and addressing his delinquent accounts in a responsible \nway, it is too soon to make safe predictive assessments as to whether Applicant can \nrestore his finances to stable levels consistent with minimum requirements for holding a \nsecurity clearance.

While Applicant is \nentitled to credit for his contributions to the defense industry, his employment \ncontributions are not enough at this time to overcome his tax-filing lapses and his lack of \na meaningful track record for dealing with them and maintaining responsible control of \nhis finances. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that, as of November 12, 2021, Applicant owed $51,424 in federal student loans in collections status (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and a $630 medical debt in collections (SOR \u00b6 1.b). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted the debts without explanation. Based on his admissions, I accept and incorporate as factual findings that Applicant defaulted on the SOR debts. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 46-year-old planning production control specialist who has worked for a defense contractor since December 2020. (GE 2; Tr. 25-26.) He was married to his first wife from March 1999 to May 2021. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 22-23.) She worked in a bank, earning $50,000 a year, and handled the household finances during their marriage. (Tr. 35, 39-40.) Applicant and his current spouse wed in October 2021. (Tr. 22-23.) Her 15-year-old son lives with them. (Tr. 33.) Applicant has two sons now ages 21 and 14 from his first 2 marriage for whom he paid child support of $1,300 per month. As of the close of the record in this case, he had a hearing scheduled for August 3, 2022, to remove his older son from his child support obligation. He expects to pay around $788 per month for child support for his younger son going forward. (Tr. 23-24.) Applicant earned his associate\u2019s degree in July 2007.

The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn November 18, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). His response was considered incomplete because he did not admit or deny the \nallegations. On February 28, 2022, Applicant admitted the two SOR allegations. On April \n19, 2022, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was ready to proceed to a \nhearing. On May 5, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on May 9, 2022. After some \ncoordination with the parties, on June 10, 2022, I scheduled a video teleconference \nhearing for June 29, 2022. \nAt the hearing convened as scheduled, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) were \nadmitted into the record without objection. An April 19, 2022 letter from Department \nCounsel forwarding copies of the GEs to Applicant was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE 1). \nAt the Government\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of Title 20, Section 1091a of the \nUnited States Code which ensures that obligations to repay federal student loans are \nenforced without regard to any federal or state limitation on the period within which debts \nmay be enforced. Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by \nDOHA on July 15, 2022. \nIn reviewing this case, I sua sponte noted that the Coronavirus Act, Relief, and \nEconomic Security Act (CARES Act), effective March 27, 2020, provided for the \nsuspension of federal student-loan payments and collection actions on eligible defaulted \nfederal student loans, and set interest rates to zero percent, initially through September 30, \n2020. The present extension of the CARES Act, which provides for the suspension of \nfederal student-loan repayment and collection actions, is scheduled to continue through \nAugust 31, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that, as of November 12, 2021, Applicant owed $51,424 in federal \nstudent loans in collections status (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and a $630 medical debt in collections \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted the debts \nwithout explanation. \nBased on his admissions, I accept and incorporate as factual findings that Applicant \ndefaulted on the SOR debts. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old planning production control specialist who has worked for \na defense contractor since December 2020. (GE 2; Tr. 25-26.) He was married to his first \nwife from March 1999 to May 2021. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 22-23.) She worked in a bank, earning \n$50,000 a year, and handled the household finances during their marriage. (Tr. 35, 39-40.) \nApplicant and his current spouse wed in October 2021. (Tr. 22-23.)

As of the close of the record \nin this case, he had a hearing scheduled for August 3, 2022, to remove his older son from \nhis child support obligation. He expects to pay around $788 per month for child support for \nhis younger son going forward. (Tr. 23-24.) \nApplicant earned his associate\u2019s degree in July 2007. He completed his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in business management online. (GE 2; Tr. 24-25.) On a November 5, 2020 \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), he indicated that he took courses \nfrom September 2012 to May 2014 at the online university from which he earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree. (GE 1.) During a personal subject interview (PSI) with an authorized \ninvestigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on December 17, 2020 (GE 2), \nhe stated that he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2009. On January 21, 2021, he was \nconfronted by the investigator with information showing that he took online classes \nbetween July 2010 and November 2014 with breaks in his attendance. He disputed the \ninformation and stated that he was awarded his bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2009. (GE 2.)  \nStudent loan information reported on his credit report (GE 3) appears to corroborate the \nenrollment dates reported by the university. \nApplicant\u2019s December 2020 credit report shows that he obtained student loans to \npay for his college education, including eight federal student loans totaling $34,033 \nobtained through the schools between December 2005 and July 2010, and a $16,192 \nstudent loan acquired in May 2014. As of November 2020, those loans were in collections \nstatus with an aggregate balance of $51,424. Between July 2007 and December 2007, \nApplicant obtained additional student loans totaling $14,646 that were being repaid on \ntime. As of October 2020, the outstanding balances on those loans totaled only $994. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report also showed that a $630 medical debt from August 2018 was in \ncollections. (GE 3.) \nSometime in 2018, Applicant found a collection notice for his defaulted federal \nstudent loans in the household trash. He confronted his then spouse about her failure to \nmake his student loan payments for him and told her to resolve the issue, but he did not \nhandle it himself. When he tried to get involved in the household finances, she would \n\u201cmake it miserable,\u201d and he did not want to deal with her. He was also overwhelmed by the \nloan balances in collections. (Tr. 38-41.) Even after his marital separation in May 2020, he \ntook no steps to address his defaulted student loans because he was focused on obtaining \ncustody of his younger son and wanted to ensure that he had the funds to pay for any legal \nfees incurred. (Tr. 41-42.) \nApplicant disclosed on his November 2020 SF 86 that he was in default of his \nfederal student loans totaling about $50,000. In response to an SF 86 inquiry into any \nactions taken to satisfy the debts, Applicant responded, \u201cgot an email about loan \nforgiveness.\u201d (GE 1.) He provided no proof that he qualified for forgiveness, cancellation, or \ndischarge of any of his federal student-loan debts, and admitted at his June 2022 security \nclearance hearing that none of his student-loan debts had been forgiven. (Tr. 44.) He \ndiscovered that the email had been a scam.

He expressed an intention to satisfy the debts once his \ndivorce from his first wife was final. He explained that she had handled the household \nfinances during their marriage and that, unbeknownst to him at the time (Tr. 38), she \nstopped making payments on his student loans when the monthly payment became \n$2,500. He stated that the issue of his defaulted student loans was being worked out in his \ndivorce settlement. When confronted with the $630 medical debt in collection, Applicant did \nnot dispute the debt, and surmised that he and his first wife could be jointly liable as it was \nfor the care of one of their sons. He described his finances as improved since his divorce \nfiling, and he expressed a willingness and ability to repay his debts. (GE 3.) \nAround the time of his marital breakup in 2020, Applicant asked a friend who is a \nfinancial advisor if he should withdraw funds from his 401(k) account to pay his student \nloans. His friend advised against doing so if it was not required and told him that any \npayments would adversely impact his credit as they would reactivate his accounts. \nApplicant gave priority to rebuilding his credit after a \u201cpretty messy\u201d divorce and took no \naction that would reactive his student loan accounts. (Tr. 19-21, 42-44.) \nIn their divorce settlement, Applicant took responsibility for his defaulted student \nloans and his car while his ex-wife was given the house, her car, and $100,000 of his \n$300,000 in 401(k) assets. (Tr. 37, 50.) As of his June 29, 2022 security clearance hearing, \nApplicant had not attempted to rehabilitate his student loans. His ex-wife has all the \ndocumentation for his student loans. She told him she does not know the whereabouts of \nhis student-loan documentation, although he has some doubts in that regard. (Tr. 54-55.) \nApplicant testified that he is willing to pay off his student loans with funds from his \n401(k) account, if necessary. (Tr. 19, 43.) He put off addressing his student loans in that \nmanner pending assurance from the Government that paying off his defaulted student \nloans would fully resolve the security concerns. (Tr. 56.) \nAfter Applicant received the SOR, he contacted his creditor to whom he owed the \n$603 medical collection debt. He was informed the debt was for a 2018 procedure. He \nplans to pay the debt after he receives requested documentation about the debt. (Tr. 44, \n46.) \nApplicant worked as a computer room supervisor for a company in the commercial \nsector from January 2001 until October 2020, when he was terminated for failing to follow \ncompany procedure. At the time of his termination, his salary was $82,000 annually. (GEs \n1-2; Tr. 29.) He received unemployment compensation for a month or two before starting \nhis present employment in December 2020. (Tr. 29.) \nApplicant\u2019s current salary with the defense contractor is $73,000 annually. He \nstarted on second shift in December 2020 and was paid a shift differential of $6,000 until \nhe transitioned to the day shift. After his first year on the job, he received a pay increase \nequivalent to 3% of his salary. (Tr. 27.) His spouse started working in 2021 as a preschool \nteacher at $16 an hour. (Tr. 30.)

(Tr. 51.) He has about $4,000 to $5,000 in his savings account and $200 in his \nchecking account. (Tr. 49.) He obtained an automobile loan for $21,323 in July 2016. As of \nOctober 2020, he had been making his payments according to terms since late spring \n2017. His loan was 30 days past due three times between November 2016 and April 2017. \n(GE 3.) \nAs of June 2022, Applicant had paid about $10,000 in attorney fees for his divorce. \nHe expects to incur additional legal fees for the hearing to reduce his child-support \nobligation. (Tr. 36-37.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also  EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant does not dispute that he defaulted on \napproximately $51,424 in federal student-loan debts and that he owes a $603 collection \ndebt for his son\u2019s medical care. Under Guideline F, disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial delinquencies,\u201d is established. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant bears the burden of mitigating the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised primarily by his defaulted student loans. Application of the aforesaid \ndisqualifying condition triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20. The following are relevant to the issues in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply, even though the SOR debts were incurred \nsome time ago. Some of the student loans were obtained between December 2005 and \nMarch 2007, but Applicant has not made any effort to address his sizeable student-loan \ndelinquency. Regarding the medical collection debt, he contacted his creditor about the \nmedical debt after he received the SOR, but it remains outstanding. An applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and are considered recent. \nSee, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability in that Applicant\u2019s ex-wife did not inform him that \nshe was not making the required payments on his federal student loans at issue. However, \nAG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under his or her circumstances. \nApplicant did not exercise sound financial judgment in several aspects after he learned in \n2018 that his loans were in collection status. He confronted his then spouse and told her to \ntake care of the issue. However, he made no effort to ensure that actions were taken to \naddress the delinquent accounts. On his marital separation, Applicant asked a friend \nwhether he should use money from his 401(k) account to pay the defaulted student loans. \nAdvised that any attempts at repayment would negatively impact his credit, Applicant \ncontinued to ignore his student-loan delinquencies, even after being placed on notice \nduring his December 2020 PSI that they were of concern to the DOD and after he was held \nsolely liable for repayment in his divorce settlement.

Perkins loans are eligible if held by the DoED and not the educational institution. \nHe testified that he obtained all of his loans through the schools he attended, but he was \nnot specific as to the type of loans he acquired. It cannot be determined from the account \ninformation of record whether his repayment responsibility is currently suspended for any of \nhis federal student loans because of the CARES Act. Even assuming that Applicant has \nnot been required to make any student loan payments since March 2020, I cannot apply \neither AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d) because of his failure to take any steps before March 2020 \nto address the student loans after he learned they were in collections. His willingness to \nuse his retirement assets to pay the loans appears to be conditioned on assurance from \nthe DOD of a favorable adjudication. Just as the security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts, it is not the position of the \nDOD to direct the manner in which an applicant handles his or her financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing disregard of his contractual obligation to repay his student loans \ncontinues to raise doubts about his financial judgment. \nApplicant demonstrated some good faith under AG \u00b6 20(d) by contacting his creditor \nabout the medical collection debt. Even so, he has not made any payments toward the \ndebt. The Appeal Board has also held that an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca plan for debt \npayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious \nintent to resolve the debts.\u201d See ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) \n(citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03889 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, 2018)). A promise to pay a \ndebt at some future date is not a substitute for a track record of timely debt payments or \notherwise financially responsible behavior. See ISCR Case No, 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. \nSep. 2008). The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness with regard to his fitness or suitability \nto handle classified information appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. \nJune 21, 2010). It is not intended as punishment for past shortcomings. There is some \nevidence of financial responsibility in that Applicant appears to be paying his living \nexpenses on time. There is no evidence of overextension on credit cards. A car loan was \npast due 30 days three times, but it has not been late since about April 2017. \nAppendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA \nadministrative judge\u2019s the discretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. See, also, \nMemorandum, Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January \n12, 2018, (\u201cAppendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making \nadjudicative decisions to grant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position. . . Effective immediately, authority to grant \nclearance eligibility with one of the exceptions enumerated within Appendix C is granted to \nany adjudicative, hearing, or appeal official or entity now authorized to grant clearance \neligibility when they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.\u201d) \nAfter carefully considering and weighing the financial considerations security \nconcerns, I decline to exercise the discretionary authority under Appendix C at this time. \nIndividuals granted eligibility for access to classified information must be held to a standard \nof good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness which, at times, may require her or him to \nmake choices that are personally difficult or disadvantageous. Applicant has prioritized his \nself-interest over addressing the debts of security concern. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). Based on the\nevidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant\nor continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. This decision should not\nbe construed as a determination that Applicant cannot in the future attain the reform \nnecessary to establish his security worthiness, especially if he is able to provide a track\nrecord of financial stability and of payments on his defaulted federal student loans. \nPersuasive evidence of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness is lacking at this time.\n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n04/08/2022 \nDecision \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. He did not present sufficient documentary evidence to \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate his history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is \ndecided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \nin April 2020. (Exhibit 3) The automated version of the SF 86 is the e-QIP. The SF 86 is \ncommonly known as a security clearance application. \nApplicant was interviewed on multiple occasions during the course of a 2020 \nbackground investigation. (Exhibit 4) He also replied to interrogatories in February 2021 \nand September 2021. (Exhibits 11 and 4, respectively) Thereafter, on or about \nNovember 5, 2021, after reviewing the available information, the DoD Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nThe SOR is similar in form and purpose to a complaint, which is the initial \npleading that starts a civil action; in some states this pleading is known as a petition; \nand in criminal law it is a formal charge accusing a person of a criminal offense. Here, \nthe SOR detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known \nas Guideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR; his answers were mixed with admissions \nand denials; and he also provided a few brief, handwritten explanations for his answers. \nHe requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. \nOn November 29, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation. The FORM was received by Applicant on December 15, 2021. He \ntimely replied with a two-page written response to the FORM, which is made part of the \nrecord as Exhibit A. The case was assigned to me on February 3, 2022. \nProcedural Matters \nBased on an initial review of Applicant\u2019s reply to the FORM (Exhibit A), I decided \non my own motion to grant Applicant an extension of time. I notified the parties via a \nFebruary 18, 2022 e-mail. I took this action based on Applicant\u2019s written reply to the \nFORM in which he asserted a claim of racial discrimination, prejudice, or bias in that he \nwas subject to racial profiling based on his status as an African American male. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s reply to the FORM; nor did they \naddress his claim of racial profiling. Given the seriousness of the allegation, I provided \nApplicant an opportunity to do the following: (1) request a hearing before an \nadministrative judge by February 28, 2022; or (2) provide additional documentation in \nsupport of his case, including evidence to support his claim of racial profiling, by March \n31, 2022. \nApplicant did not request a hearing, but he made a timely submission of \nadditional documentation on March 30, 2022. Those matters are made part of the \nrecord without objections as follows: (1) Exhibit B \u2013 a one-page document for tax year \n2020 from the state tax authority, dated July 7, 2021; (2) Exhibit C \u2013 the first page of a \nletter from the IRS concerning tax year 2019, dated May 25, 2021; (3) Exhibit D \u2013 two \npages from the IRS concerning an installment agreement and payment detail during \nSeptember 2020 to September 2021 for tax years 2019 and 2020; (4) Exhibit E \u2013 the \nfirst page of a letter from the IRS concerning tax year 2020, dated August 3, 2021; and \n(5) Exhibit F \u2013 the first page of a loan-modification agreement between Applicant and a \nmortgage lender with an effective date of August 23, 2021. He previously provided \nsome of these documents in response to interrogatories.

He has been employed by the same company since about September \n2017 in State #1. As set forth below, he lived in State #2 from 2006 to late 2017. He \nwas last granted a security clearance in 2014. (Exhibit 3, Section 25, and Exhibit 12) He \nmarried for the fourth time in 2017, his three previous marriages having ended in \ndivorce. He has an adult child and an adult stepchild. \nApplicant\u2019s educational background includes an associate degree awarded in \n2012 and a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in 2014 from the same university in State #2. \nBefore entering the university, he worked in State #2 as a site manager during 2006-\n2010. (Exhibit 3) He was unemployed during the period of February 2010 to May 2014, \nwhile attending the university in State #2. After receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree, he \nworked as a federal civilian employee at a military installation in State #2 from May \n2014 to September 2017, when he began his current job in State #1.  \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes honorable military service. He served on \nactive duty in the U.S. Navy for about 12 years during 1980-1992. He also served in the\nU.S. Army Reserve for about five years during 1996-2001. He described himself as a\n100%-disabled Veteran with traumatic brain injury, memory loss, radiculopathy, \ndegenerative disc disorder, shipwreck survivor, several gunshot wounds, post-traumatic\nstress disorder, and debilitating migraines. (Exhibit A) He receives disability\ncompensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on a monthly basis. (Exhibit\n4 at 19)   \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a history of financial problems or difficulties consisting of two \nChapter 13 bankruptcy cases, noncompliance with state and federal tax obligations, \nfour delinquent accounts in amounts ranging from $145 to $20,988 for a total of about \n$41,090, and a past-due mortgage loan in the amount of $34,907. These matters are \ndiscussed below. \n1. Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases\u2014SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems or difficulties date back to approximately \nNovember 2009, when he sought relief by filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. (Exhibit \n5) He filed the case in a federal bankruptcy court located in State #2, where he lived at \nthe time. The bankruptcy court confirmed a repayment plan in February 2010; the plan \nwas completed in May 2014; the court issued an order of discharge in June 2014; and \nthe case was closed in July 2014.

(Exhibit 4 at 15) Based on my review of the Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy case docket text, it appears a refinance of real property (e.g., refinancing a \nmortgage loan) was involved in the case. (Exhibit 5) \nApplicant filed a second Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in November 2019. (Exhibit \n6) He filed the case in a federal bankruptcy court located in his state of current \nresidence, State #1. It does not appear the bankruptcy court confirmed a repayment \nplan. Applicant explained he filed the case per the advice of legal counsel in an effort to \navoid losing his home, because he had fallen behind on a mortgage loan and was \nattempting to obtain a loan modification from the mortgage lender. (Exhibit A; Exhibit 4 \nat 15-16) The bankruptcy court dismissed the case in response to the Chapter 13 \nTrustee\u2019s motion to dismiss in August 2020. The case was closed in October 2020.  \n2. Noncompliance with income-tax obligations\u2014SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e.  \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is in noncompliance with state income-tax obligations \nto file tax returns, as required, for tax years 2011-2016, and that he owes back taxes in \nthe amount of about $8,616 for those same tax years. The state tax authority is State \n#1, where he has worked and lived since about late 2017. Applicant denied the \nallegations in his answer to the SOR. In their brief, Department Counsel relies on a \nproof of claim filed by the State #1 tax authority in the 2019 Chapter 13 bankruptcy \ncase. (Brief at 3; Exhibit 7) The December 2019 proof of claim asserts Applicant owes \nindividual income tax due to non-filing estimated at $1,436 per year for a total amount of \n$8,616 for tax years 2011-2016. Note, there are no tax liens reflected in credit reports \nfrom September 2021, March 2021, and July 2020. (Exhibits 8, 9, and 10) \nAs set forth above, Applicant lived in State #2 from 2006 to late 2017. He was an \nunemployed student at a university in State #2 during 2010-2014. His time at the \nuniversity occurred between periods of employment in State #2 during 2006-2010 and \n2014-2017. Department Counsel acknowledged that Applicant \u201cmay have lived in [State \n#2] for some portion of that time period,\u201d but did not offer an argument to establish that \nApplicant was required to file income tax returns and pay income tax in a state in which \nhe did not reside during the relevant tax years. Without substantial evidence Applicant \nwas a bona fide part-year or nonresident taxpayer in State #1, it is difficult to find he \nwas required by law to file tax returns and pay income tax in State #1 for the tax years \nin question. Given the conflicting evidence here, the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d \nare unproven. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e concerns back taxes owed to the IRS in the amount \nof $6,605 for tax years 2019 and 2020. Applicant admitted this allegation, in part, in his \nanswer to the SOR. He also explained he was on a payment plan. He submitted \ndocumentation from the IRS showing the following: (1) sometime in 2020, he entered \ninto an installment agreement with the IRS agreeing to make monthly payments; (2) \nduring September 2020 to September 2021, he made ten installment payments for a \ntotal of $2,009, which were applied to tax year 2019; (3) in May 2021, the IRS notified \nApplicant that his monthly payment was increasing to $250 beginning in July 2021; (4) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin August 2021, the IRS notified Applicant that his installment agreement was revised to \ninclude the balance owed for tax year 2020 with the monthly payment remaining \nunchanged; and (5) as of September 2021, he owed $195 in back taxes for tax year \n2019 and $4,054 in back taxes for tax year 2020. (Exhibits C, D, E, and 4 at 5-7) The \nsame documents show he last made a payment of $250 in July 2021. He did not \nprovide documentation of payments made since July 2021. \n3. Four delinquent accounts\u2014SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i.   \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has four delinquent accounts in amounts ranging \nfrom $145 to $20,988 for a total of about $41,090. Two are collection accounts and two \nare charged-off accounts. Applicant admitted owing a $20,988 charged-off account and \ndenied the three other matters in his answer to the SOR. The four delinquent accounts \nare established by credit reports from September 2021 and March 2021. (Exhibits 8 and \n9) Applicant did not provide documentary proof that any of the four accounts were paid, \nsettled, in a repayment plan, disputed, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved.  \n4. Past-due mortgage loan\u2014SOR \u00b6 1.j. \nThe allegation here concerns a past-due mortgage loan in the amount of \n$34,907. It was mentioned above during discussion of the 2019 Chapter 13 bankruptcy \ncase. Applicant admitted having the mortgage loan but explained he was no longer past \ndue in his answer to the SOR. He explained he fell behind on his mortgage loan \npayments after his spouse was injured on the job and was unable to return to \nemployment. (Exhibit A) He filed the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case per the advice of his \nattorney to prevent a foreclosure. Over a lengthy period of time, Applicant sought a loan \nmodification from his mortgage lender. He succeeded in that endeavor in August 2021. \nAs proof, he submitted page 1 of 6 pages of the August 23, 2021 loan modification \nagreement. (Exhibit F) He did not submit documentation of monthly mortgage loan \npayments since August 2021. Nor did he submit a recent account statement for the \nmortgage loan. The most recent credit report from September 2021 shows the \nmortgage loan (a VA real estate mortgage) was included in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy \ncase, the account has a balance of $0, and is past due in the amount of $0. (Exhibit 8 at \n2) \nConcerning his overall finances, Applicant provided a pay statement from \nFebruary 2021 that reflects a biweekly base rate of $2,724, which is about $70,000 \nannually. (Exhibit 11 at 5) Note, there are no tax liens, garnishments, or similar \nwithholdings reflected in the pay statement. It does reflect a deduction of about $65 for \nan unspecified loan. During his background investigation, Applicant stated that he \nreceives monthly disability compensation from the VA in amounts ranging from $1,531 \nto $1,884. (Exhibit 4 at 19) At the high end, that is $22,608 in annual tax-free income; at \nthe low end it\u2019s $18,372. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s \nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.4 Substantial \nevidence means \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support \na conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.\u201d5 Substantial evidence is a lesser burden than \nboth clear and convincing evidence and preponderance of the evidence, the latter of \nwhich is the standard applied in most civil trials. It is also a far lesser burden than \nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the norm for criminal trials. \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.7 \n1 Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns, or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nWith that said, his financial problems are not as problematic as they may appear in the \nSOR. To his credit, he completed the court-ordered repayment plan for the 2009 \nChapter 13 bankruptcy case, which ended with a discharge in 2014. The relatively \nrecent 2019 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was due to the past-due mortgage loan, which \nis a common legal strategy to prevent foreclosure. The allegations of noncompliance \nwith the State #1 tax authority are unproven. He reduced the amount of back taxes \nowed to the IRS from $6,605 to $4,250 as of September 2021, a reduction of about \n36%. Moreover, Applicant succeeded in obtaining a loan modification of the mortgage \nloan, although he could have done more to document that fact. What\u2019s remaining is not \nminor, however, as there are four unresolved delinquent accounts for more than \n$40,000. It appears he has taken little to no remedial action on those debts. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI also considered the mitigating conditions as set forth in AG \u00b6 20. Applicant \nreceives credit for his efforts to repay back taxes owed to the IRS via an installment \npayment agreement. He reduced the amount owed by about 36%, a substantial \nreduction. See AG \u00b6 20(d) and AG \u00b6 20(g) He is also due credit for his sustained efforts \nto obtain a loan modification for his past-due mortgage loan. See AG \u00b6 20(d) And he \nreceives credit in mitigation because of the loss of his spouse\u2019s income due to a work-\nrelated injury. Applicant claimed the loss of income led to the past-due mortgage loan, \nwhich resulted in the most recent bankruptcy case. See AG \u00b6 20(b) All these matters \nweigh in his favor. \nNevertheless, the four delinquent accounts for more than $40,000 are wholly \nunresolved. Likewise, there are no prospects that Applicant will take steps to resolve \nthem in the near future. What\u2019s missing here is a track record of repayment of those four \ndelinquent accounts. So despite his efforts, Applicant has too much wholly unresolved \ndelinquent debt to justify a favorable clearance decision. Accordingly, the Guideline F \nmatter is decided against Applicant. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. In doing so, I gave \nApplicant substantial credit for his years of honorable military service and for his status \nas a 100%-disabled Veteran, for which I have respect and appreciation. I conclude that \nhe has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

In his SF 86, \nhe acknowledged that he failed to timely file his 2018 Federal tax return because of \nissues with his ex-wife. He further claimed in his SF 86 that he had not and could not file \nhis 2019 Federal tax return until the IRS processed his late 2018 Federal tax return. \nAccording to the information he provided in his SF 86, Applicant had not filed his 2019 \nFederal tax return as of July 2020. He provided no evidence that he requested an \nextension with the IRS. Therefore, his entries in his SF 86 and lack of proof of an \nextension request establish the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The SOR allegations are \nestablished through Applicant\u2019s admissions, his entries in his SF 86, and the other \nGovernment exhibits. (Items 1-6) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his unemployment, his divorce, \nrecord inflation, supporting a family as the sole breadwinner, and not receiving Federal \nincome tax refunds from the IRS. He was unemployed for a period from about August \n2012 to April 2013, while he attended college, and from August 2016 to April 2018. His \nAugust 2016 unemployment began when he quit his job instead of being fired after he \nlost his commercial driver\u2019s license as a result of a driving under the influence (DUI) \nconviction.1 Applicant provided a Personal Financial Statement with his July 2021 \ninterrogatory responses that showed he had a net remainder of $857 per month.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of failing to pay delinquent debts. He did not timely file his \n2018 and 2019 Federal tax returns. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant\u2019s divorce and record inflation were beyond his control. His failure to \ntimely file his 2018 and 2019 Federal tax returns was arguably beyond his control as he \nalleged that the delay was caused because of difficulties with his ex-wife. Therefore, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthese late filings could have resulted from his divorce. Applicant\u2019s August 2016 to April \n2018 unemployment as a result of quitting his job after a DUI was within his control. \nWith respect to the SOR debts, there is no documentary evidence of payments to \nor payment arrangements with creditors. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present \ndocumentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Applicant stated that he intends to pay the SOR \ndebts once he receives his Federal tax refunds from 2018 and 2019. However, \nintentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013).  \nAs evidenced by his Personal Financial Statement, Applicant has funds to \ncontribute toward his delinquent debts while he awaits his aforementioned Federal tax \nrefunds. Given his failure to provide evidence that he has made payments on his \ndelinquent SOR debts despite having the means to do so, I cannot find that he has \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. His failure to provide proof that he has \nmade payment arrangements also shows that he has not made a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. \nWith respect to his unfiled Federal tax returns, I cannot find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, or that he made arrangements with the IRS to file \nthe tax returns. He has provided no documentary evidence to show that he has \ncompleted the relevant tax returns, nor has he provided documentary evidence of \nmailing his returns to the IRS. Moreover, even if we are to assume that his tax returns \nwere not being processed by the IRS after he mailed them three times, he did not take \nthe reasonable step of filing them electronically or consulting a tax professional for \nassistance. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice and his honorable discharge. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n  \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nAppellant used marijuana from about 2008 until at least October of 2021. She did \nnot clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue her misuse. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), \n(c) and (g) are established.  \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply, as Applicant continued to use marijuana, disregarding \nFederal law that prohibits its usage. \nWhole-Person Concept \n4 \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from her drug involvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He did not \nintentionally or deliberately provide false information on a security clearance application. \nAccordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \nin July 2020. (Exhibit 3) The automated version of the SF 86 is the e-QIP. The SF 86 is \ncommonly known as a security clearance application. \nApplicant was interviewed during the course of a 2021 background investigation. \n(Exhibit 7) Thereafter, on October 15, 2021, after reviewing the available information, \nthe DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThe SOR is similar in form and purpose to a complaint, which is the initial \npleading that starts a civil action; in some states this pleading is known as a petition; \nand in criminal law it is a formal charge accusing a person of an offense. Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guidelines known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 7, 2021.

(Exhibit 7) He explained he did not make payments on the \naccount because he lacked the money to do so. This debt remains unresolved. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a $4,632 collection account. A June 2021 credit \nreport reflects this debt is from an individual account placed for collection. (Exhibit 4) \nApplicant admitted this matter in his answer to the SOR. During the background \ninvestigation he stated the debt stemmed from a loan he obtained to buy a motorcycle. \n(Exhibit 7) He explained he stopped making payments on the account because he \nlacked the funds to do so due to the previously mentioned legal expenses. This debt \nremains unresolved. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is a $388 charged-off account. A June 2021 credit \nreport reflects this debt is from a joint contract. (Exhibit 4) Applicant stated in his answer \nto the SOR that the debt was due to a personal dispute that has been paid. During the \nbackground investigation he stated the account stemmed from an auto insurance \naccount he cosigned for his parents. (Exhibit 7) He explained he made no payments on \nthe account as his parents said they would pay it. Although he did not submit \ndocumentary proof of payment, given his explanation concerning joint responsibility for \nthe account I find the debt is resolved. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is a $299 collection account. A June 2021 credit \nreport reflects this debt is from an individual account placed for collection. (Exhibit 4) \nApplicant admitted this matter in his answer to the SOR and said it was in disagreement \nor dispute. The debt was not addressed during the background investigation. (Exhibit 7) \nThe debt remains unresolved. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is a $71 collection account. A June 2021 credit \nreport reflects this debt is from an individual account placed for collection. (Exhibit 4) \nApplicant admitted this matter in his answer to the SOR. During the background \ninvestigation he stated the account stemmed from cable or Internet service. (Exhibit 7) \nHe explained that he returned the equipment to the provider and he is disputing the \naccount. He has not provided documentation in support of his claim. This debt remains \nunresolved. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is for a balance due of $10,564 after repossession \nof an automobile. A June 2021 credit report reflects a joint contract as well as a \nvoluntary surrender of the collateral. (Exhibit 4) Applicant admitted this matter in his \nanswer to the SOR and explained his former spouse had paid the account. During the \nbackground investigation he stated the account stemmed from an auto loan obtained in \n2012 or 2013. (Exhibit 7) He explained that he stopped making payments on the loan \nwhile going through the divorce, he notified the creditor of his inability to pay, the vehicle \nwas recovered by the creditor, and he believes the balance due is based on a \ndeficiency balance after sale. Appended to his answer is documentary proof of \npayment, apparently from his former spouse judging the e-mail address, in the amount \nof $15,391 payable to the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. The difference in the amounts is \nprobably due to late fees, legal fees, or compound interest.

Credit reports \nfrom May 2019 and September 2020 show Applicant was listed as an authorized user \nand not a party responsible for the account. (Exhibits 6 and 5, respectively) The debt is \nnot reported in the June 2021 credit report. (Exhibit 4) Applicant denied this debt in his \nanswer to the SOR. During the background investigation he stated that the account \nbelonged to his former spouse and that he never had an account with this particular \nbank. (Exhibit 7) Department Counsel, to her credit, conceded Applicant was an \nauthorized user on this account and therefore not legally responsible for repayment of \nthe debt. (Brief at page 2, n. 1) The allegation that Applicant owes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g \nis unproven. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.h is a bit odd because it does not allege a sum certain \nof indebtedness. Instead, it alleges Applicant is \u201cindebted\u201d to a mortgage lender on a \nloan that went into foreclosure. Credit reports from 2021, 2020, and 2019 reflect the \naccount was for a real estate mortgage and was a joint contract. (Exhibits 4, 5, and 6, \nrespectively) Applicant admitted this matter in his answer to the SOR; he explained he \nmoved out of the marital home during the divorce and paid his former spouse his portion \nof the mortgage loan payment; and he later discovered that his former spouse did not \npay the mortgage loan and used the money for other purposes leading to the \nforeclosure. He provided a similar explanation during the background investigation. \n(Exhibit 7) All three credit reports reflect a $0 balance after a foreclosure (Exhibits 4, 5, \nand 6). The $0 balance is consistent with the fact that the foreclosed residential real \nestate was located in a jurisdiction where the state law provides for only non-recourse \nmortgage loans. The allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.h is resolved because Applicant is no longer \nindebted on the mortgage loan, but the history of non-payment, default, and foreclosure \nremain relevant. \nOverall, Applicant explained in his answer to the SOR that his divorce harmed his \nfinances and he was also involved in an ongoing custody battle over his son (details not \notherwise specified). He noted that his continued employment was necessary for him to \nresolve his bad debts and pay for the legal expenses of the custody battle. He \nmentioned he may file for bankruptcy protection in order to obtain a fresh start. \nIn addition to the financial matters, the SOR alleges under Guideline E that \nApplicant falsified his answers to multiple questions he answered about his financial \nhistory in his security clearance application. Indeed, his answers to all financial \nquestions in Section 26 of the SF 86 were in the negative, and he did not disclose or \nreport any financial problems in his July 2020 security clearance application. (Exhibit 3) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted incorrectly answering the questions, but \nexplained he did so because he did not thoroughly read the questions. He provided a \nsimilar explanation during the background investigation. (Exhibit 7) He stated that he did \nnot list any of his delinquent account information due to misreading the questionnaire \nand not understanding that these particular accounts were required to be listed or \nreported. He believed he had correctly answered the financial questions, but now \nrealizes he did not. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.

It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nWith that said, the findings of fact show his financial problems are not as problematic as \nthe $44,915 of delinquent debt alleged in the SOR may appear. First, the four accounts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a for $9,757, 1.b for $4,632, 1.d for $299, and 1.e for $71 are unresolved. \nSecond, the three accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c for $388, 1.f for $10,564, and 1.g for $19,386 \nare resolved or unproven. And third, the mortgage loan account in SOR \u00b6 1.h is \nresolved with a finding of no longer indebted due to the unequivocal evidence of a $0 \nbalance reflected in all three credit reports in the record evidence. Moreover, the \nforeclosure appears to be directly related to his divorce. In summary, Applicant owes \nabout $14,759 in total for four delinquent accounts, and he has taken little to no \nremedial action on those debts. The disqualifying conditions noted above apply. \nApplicant has not sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated his history of \nfinancial problems. I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nconclude none are fully applicable. I gave due consideration to his divorce but note it \noccurred more than five years ago in 2016. Given his full-time employment in the \ndefense industry, he has had sufficient time and opportunity to make progress in \nrecovering from the financial fallout from the divorce. It seems reasonable that he could \nhave simply paid the two smaller debts of $299 and $71 just to get them off the books. It \nalso seems reasonable that he could have entered into repayment agreements for the \ntwo larger debts. It appears those matters were not a priority for Applicant. I also \nconsidered his statement about the ongoing custody battle over his minor son and the \nassociated legal expenses. I am unable to give his statement much weight because he \ndid not provide any documentation to substantiate or corroborate his statements. In \naddition, what\u2019s missing here is a reasonable degree of documentation to demonstrate \nthat he initiated a good-faith effort to resolve the four remaining delinquent accounts for \nnearly $15,000 and is making reasonable progress in doing so. Accordingly, the \nGuideline F matter is decided against Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about a person\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. The concern is stated fully in AG \u00b6 15. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I have considered the following disqualifying \ncondition as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent financial accounts when completing his \nJuly 2020 security clearance application. He should have. Nevertheless, given the state \nof the record evidence before me, I am not persuaded that his nondisclosure was a \ndeliberate or intentional omission, concealment, or falsification of his derogatory \nfinancial history. Accordingly, the Guideline E matter is decided for Applicant. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns\nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept, and I gave \nApplicant credit for his years of honorable military service, for which I have respect and \nappreciation. I conclude that he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

(Item 3; Item 4; Item 5) \nApplicant admitted using marijuana from September 2009 to August 2010, and \nthen again from 2012 to at least August 2020, while granted access to classified \ninformation, as alleged in the SOR. (Item I; Item 2) \nIn February 2012, Applicant completed his first SCA in anticipation of an internship \nwith Company A, and he disclosed he used marijuana four times between September \n2009 and August 2010.

Company A kept him on the company payroll \nstarting in May 2012, and he worked one hour a week as an intern to maintain his security \nclearance until he graduated from college. After he graduated in May 2014, he was hired \nfull time by Company A. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5) \nApplicant completed a second SCA in October 2020. He disclosed no use of drugs \nin this SCA. It was not alleged in the SOR that he falsified his SCA; therefore, this \ninformation will not be considered disqualifying, but it will be considered in determining if \nmitigation is applicable and under whole-person consideration.

He stated that he started \nusing marijuana in 2012, and his use typically consisted of taking a few hits off of joints \nat least two to three times a year at parties. At the time of the interview, he did not intend \nto stop or reduce his marijuana use, as it was so infrequent; he did not feel the need to \nstop using illegal drugs; and if marijuana is present at parties, he will use it. (Item 5) \nWhen questioned regarding using marijuana while holding a security clearance, \nApplicant initially told the investigator that he was under the impression that because \nmarijuana is legal in his state of residence, he was not aware he was required to disclose \nhis use on his SCA.

Finally, his company has a policy regarding the use of illegal drugs, including \nmarijuana, despite local laws legalizing its use.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence established the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe burden shifted to Applicant to prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s decision to use marijuana, an illegal drug, multiple times, while holding \na secret security clearance, cannot be considered a minor lapse in judgment, but rather \na pattern of behavior that reflects his unwillingness to follow rules and regulations. \nSecurity clearance decisions are not limited to conduct during duty hours. Off-duty \nconduct, especially where it reflects poor judgment, provides a rational basis for the \ngovernment to question an applicant\u2019s security worthiness. (See, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351 \nU.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. Department of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1 \n(1989)). Applicant\u2019s behavior showed a disregard for the law, regulations, and the \nfiduciary relationship he voluntarily entered into with the Government.  \nIn February 2021, Applicant told the investigator that starting in 2012, he used \nmarijuana two to three times a year when he went to parties. In September 2021, when \nhe was asked to adopt this statement, he reduced his marijuana use to a total of ten times \nbetween 2012 and August 2020. He did not indicate that the investigator mischaracterized \nhis statement regarding the amount that he used marijuana. This appears to be a \nminimization of his illegal conduct. Regardless of the frequency of his use, he admittedly \nused marijuana at least ten times after he applied for his first security clearance in \nFebruary 2012. \nApplicant also told the investigator that he did not intend to stop or reduce his \nmarijuana use, as it was so infrequent; he did not feel the need to stop using illegal drugs; \nand if marijuana is present at parties, he will use it. Applicant\u2019s claims in September 2021 \nthat he had been abstinent since August 2020, and his intention to remain abstinent are \nunconvincing given his previous claims in his February 2012 SCA. Even if I accept his \nassertions that he has stopped using illegal drugs, they are insufficient to overcome the \nconcerns with respect to his past drug involvement while holding a security clearance. At \nthis time, he did not demonstrate a lengthy enough pattern of abstinence, given the \ncircumstances under which he chose to use marijuana. Applicant failed to establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence, including his \nletters of recommendation. \nApplicant chose to use marijuana while working for his current employer and \nholding a secret security clearance. He used marijuana for almost the entirety of the time \nhe has held a security clearance and worked for his employer who has a policy against \nillegal drug use. There has not been a sufficient passage of time to overcome the \nconcerns with his drug involvement. I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof \nand persuasion. He did not mitigate the drug involvement or substance misuse security \nconcerns or establish his eligibility to maintain a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

He has two adult children. He served in the \nArmy National Guard from 1997 until 2005, when he received an honorable discharge. \n(Items 5, 15) \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s untimely filed federal \nincome tax returns for the 2013 through 2017 tax years (SOR \u00b6 1.a); his untimely filed \nstate income tax return for the 2013 tax year (SOR \u00b6 1.b); his delinquent state taxes \ntotaling about $5,800 for the 2014 and 2015 tax years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d); and nine \ndelinquent consumer debts totaling about $14,700 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.m). In his \nSOR response, he admitted all but one of the Guideline F SOR allegations with \nadditional comments. He denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m for $132 because he claimed \nthat he paid it. The Guideline F SOR allegations are established through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the Government\u2019s evidence. (Items 4-12, 15) \nUnder Guideline J, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s eight criminal charges \nfrom December 1996 through July 2015. Applicant admitted the Guideline J allegations \nwith additional comments for two of the charges, claiming that he was not convicted of \nthose charges. (Items 4-5, 13-15) \nApplicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for the 2013 through 2017 \ntax years, as required. He claimed that this failure resulted from a hardship, but he does \nnot explain the nexus between his hardship and his failure to file. The only documentary \nevidence he provided of his attempts to remedy these delinquent federal tax filings is an \nentry in his 2014 IRS account transcript that notes \u201c[t]ax return secured\u201d in July 2020. \nHe provided documentary evidence that he filed his 2018 federal income tax return on \ntime, and that he received a refund for that tax year. However, that refund was offset \nagainst his IRS delinquencies for the 2009 and 2010 tax years.1 (Items 4-7, 15) \nApplicant failed to timely file his State A income tax return for the 2013 tax year. \nHe provided no documentary evidence to show that he has since filed this delinquent \nstate tax return. (Items 4-7, 15) \nApplicant owes State A for income taxes for the 2014 and 2015 tax years in the \napproximate amount of $5,800. With respect to the 2014 tax year, between February \n2017 and May 2018, he made payments totaling $1,763. For the 2015 tax year, a \npayment of $798 was credited to Applicant\u2019s account. It is unclear whether this credit \nwas a voluntary payment or an offset. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant \n1 Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant\u2019s additional federal and state tax \ndelinquencies, cannot be used for disqualification purposes.

(Items 4-7, 15) \nApplicant\u2019s nine delinquent consumer debts totaling about $14,700 remain \nunresolved. While he claimed that he is working to resolve these delinquencies, he \nprovided no documentary evidence of his efforts to do so. All of these consumer debts \nwith the exception of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m appear on the 2022 credit report. The debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m appear on the 2021 credit report. Applicant also has an overdrawn \naccount in the amount of $274 that is not listed in the SOR. (Items 4-12, 15) \nApplicant claimed that his financial issues arose because of unemployment, \ndivorce, and caring for his ailing father. He stated that his intent is to make payment \narrangements with respect to all his delinquencies. (Items 5, 6, 15) \nApplicant was charged with crimes eight times between 1996 and 2015. While it \nwas not listed in the SOR, he was also cited for an HOV lane infraction in October 2018. \nHis criminal charges consist of a total of five domestic violence charges in 2002, 2003, \n2007, 2008, and 2015; a drug possession charge in 1996; and two driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol (DUI) charges in 2002 and 2005. (Items 4, 5, 13-15) \nThe 1996 drug possession charge was a felony, but despite having marijuana in \nhis pocket, the charges against Applicant were dropped as the search leading to the \ncharge was considered unlawful. The 2002 and 2005 DUIs resulted in convictions. The \n2003 and 2007 domestic violence charges resulted in convictions. The 2007 domestic \nviolence charge was a felony, but he was convicted of a lesser charge. Applicant \nviolated the conditions of his parole for his 2003 domestic violence conviction by \ncommitting his 2005 DUI, failing to report to his parole supervisor, failing to pay fees, \nand failing to report changes in address. The 2008 domestic violence charges were \ndropped. The 2015 domestic violence charge was a felony but the charges were \ndropped. All of these domestic violence charges resulted from physical altercations with \nApplicant\u2019s spouse or significant other.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He has not complied with his \nfederal income tax return filing requirements for several tax years. He has failed to \ncomply with his state income tax return filing requirement for one tax year. He has \ndelinquent state taxes and delinquent consumer debts. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant has several years of federal income tax returns that he has yet to file. \nHe also has one year of state income tax returns that he has not filed. He failed to show \nwhy his failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns was due to \ncircumstances beyond his control. He has not provided evidence of any arrangement \nwith the IRS or the State A taxation authority to file his late income tax returns. While he \nhas provided documentary evidence of some payments on his delinquent income taxes \nto State A, he still has a sizeable balance and he provided no evidence of a payment \narrangement with State A. \nAs he suffered from unemployment and had to take care of his ailing father, \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent taxes to State A and his delinquent consumer debts were \narguably caused by circumstances beyond his control. However, he has not addressed \nhis consumer debts. Therefore, he has not acted responsibly under the circumstances \nor made a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise address his consumer debts. There is \nevidence that Applicant has made some payments towards his delinquent state taxes. \nHowever, he still has a balance and there is no evidence of payments on his state taxes \nafter 2020. Therefore, he has not provided sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly \nor made a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve his state tax debt.  \nAs he has unaddressed delinquent federal and state income tax filings and \nunresolved state tax and consumer debts, his financial issues are current and ongoing. \nFurther undermining his evidence in mitigation, Applicant also has another delinquent \ndebt not listed in the SOR. For these reasons, none of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions apply. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a\ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program.  \n \nApplicant has been charged with criminal offenses at least eight times. Several of \nthese criminal charges were for felonies and three resulted in conviction. Five of these \ncriminal charges involved domestic violence. Applicant violated the conditions of his \nparole from his 2003 domestic violence conviction. The above disqualifying conditions \nare applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nWhile there is evidence that Applicant was charged with and convicted of serious \ncrimes, the last of his criminal charges came seven years ago. There is no evidence \nthat he has engaged in criminal activity since then. His October 2018 HOV violation is \nthe latest evidence there is that he has committed any rule infraction. Given the at least \nseven years that have passed since his last criminal charges, I find that his criminal \nbehavior is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. I also find that this passage of time without evidence of criminal activity \nprovides evidence of successful rehabilitation. The Guideline J security concerns are \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns, but that he did mitigate the \ncriminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has substantial past-due indebtedness. These facts establish prima \nfacie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of these apply. Although Applicant can attribute some debts to his divorce, \nand is disputing one small debt, there are no clear indications that his financial issues \nare under control. He still has significant past-due indebtedness. Financial \nConsiderations is found against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, \neligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He has not met his burden to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through1.i: \n    AGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k. and 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Applicant stated that since he has now filed all of his \nincome tax returns, his refunds are going towards his tax debts, and he has reduced his \ntax liability to about $7,000. He has already set up an automatic payment allotment of \n$461 monthly to pay his back due taxes, until the debt is paid in full. (Tr. p. 30.) This \nallegation is found for the Applicant. \n1.c. Applicant failed to timely file his state income tax returns for tax years 2017 through \n2020.  Applicant explained that he did not file them because he did not have the money \nto pay the taxes.  (Tr. p. 28.)  He states that his 2017 and 2018 returns were filed at the \nend of last year.  His 2019 and 2020 returns were filed at the beginning of this year.  (Tr. \np. 29.)  He filed his 2021 return about a month and a half before the hearing.  Applicant \nowes no state taxes.  This allegation is found for the Applicant.   \n1.d. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $7,361. This is a personal loan Applicant took out to get an \napartment and furnish it. He made three payments and could no longer pay the debt. \nHe plans to pay the debt as soon as he can. (Tr. 35.) Applicant has included this debt \nin the debt consolidation program and will be working toward resolving it. (Applicant\u2019s \nPost-Hearing Exhibit A.) The debt is still owing. \n1.e. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $5,515. \nThis is a personal loan Applicant used for living \nexpenses. He plans to pay the debt as soon as he can. (Tr. p. 36.) Applicant has \nincluded this debt in the debt consolidation program, and will be working toward \nresolving it.

He made \npayments toward the debt as longer as he could, until he could no longer afford to. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated February 12, 2021, shows the debt as owing. \n(Government Exhibit 3.)  The debt is still owing.     \nApplicant stated that he averages about $100,000 annually.  After paying his rent \nof $1,720, his car payment of $611, child support of $700, and other monthly expenses, \nhe still has some money left at the end of the month.  He does not spend lavishly or \nwastefully, and is not getting into any further debt.  He is currently following the \ninstructions of the debt consolidation company and making monthly payments of $163 \nbi-weekly to be applied toward the delinquent debts listed in the contract.  (Tr. pp. 51-\n54.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant became excessively indebted about the time he moved from one city to \nanother to take a new job, and then went through a divorce. He has been unable to pay \nhis delinquent debts. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant states that he has every intent to pay his delinquent debts, but has \nbeen unable to afford to do so. He has allegedly paid one small debt, and made two \npayments toward another debt. Applicant recently hired a debt consolidation company \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nto assist him in resolving his delinquent debt. He has included about $21,000 worth of \ndebt in this consolidation program and is just starting the process to resolve them. \nThere is still a significant amount of debt that he has not included in the program. In the \nscheme of things, it will take him a significant amount of time to resolve his total \nindebtedness. At one point, Applicant had planned on filing for bankruptcy, but was \nadvised by an attorney not to do so. Although Applicant enrolled in a debt consolidation \nprogram he has not made any real progress toward resolving his debts as of yet. This \nis too little, too late. Applicant needs more time to show the Government that he will \ncontinue to properly resolve his financial delinquencies with regular systematic \npayments and consistency. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts have been resolved. Overall, Applicant shows little progress towards resolving \nhis debts. He still owes a significant amount of money to his creditors that he cannot \nafford to pay or has simply ignored for many years. There is insufficient evidence in the \nrecord to show that the Applicant has carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation \nof the government security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant follows through with his commitment to show financial responsibility, \nsometime in the future he may be found to be sufficiently reliable to properly protect and \naccess classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d. through 1.h.  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i. \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j through 1.r. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Under Guideline J, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in February 2017 for theft of mail, found guilty of that offense, and that his sentence included restitution and five years\u2019 probation (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that he resigned in lieu of being fired as a mail carrier after it was discovered that he opened U.S. mail and stole gift cards (SOR \u00b6 2.a), that he received a written warning from a federal contractor for using a company prepaid mailing label to mail personal mail (SOR \u00b6 2.b), that his employment with that federal contractor was terminated for not being forthcoming about his criminal history (SOR \u00b6 2.d), and that he falsified material facts regarding his criminal history on his March 2017 e-QIP (SOR \u00b6 2.c). He admitted the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 2.a., 2.b., and 2.d, without explanation. He denied the allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.c, stating that his failure to disclose that he had been arrested and was pending trial was due to an unintentional oversight. (Items 1, 2) Applicant is 42 years old. He graduated from high school in 1999 and earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2000. He served on active duty in the Army from 1999 to 2014 and was honorably discharged. He has been married since 2005 and has one child.

On \nNovember 5, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), citing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline J (criminal conduct) and \nGuideline E (personal conduct). DOD acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for \nall adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nOn January 6, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

Since there were no objections by Applicant, Items 1 through 6 are admitted \ninto evidence. The case was assigned to me on March 25, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in February 2017 \nfor theft of mail, found guilty of that offense, and that his sentence included restitution and \nfive years\u2019 probation (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that he resigned \nin lieu of being fired as a mail carrier after it was discovered that he opened U.S. mail and \nstole gift cards (SOR \u00b6 2.a), that he received a written warning from a federal contractor \nfor using a company prepaid mailing label to mail personal mail (SOR \u00b6 2.b), that his \nemployment with that federal contractor was terminated for not being forthcoming about \nhis criminal history (SOR \u00b6 2.d), and that he falsified material facts regarding his criminal \nhistory on his March 2017 e-QIP (SOR \u00b6 2.c). He admitted the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., \n2.a., 2.b., and 2.d, without explanation. He denied the allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.c, stating that \nhis failure to disclose that he had been arrested and was pending trial was due to an \nunintentional oversight. (Items 1, 2) \nApplicant is 42 years old. He graduated from high school in 1999 and earned an \nassociate\u2019s degree in 2000. He served on active duty in the Army from 1999 to 2014 and \nwas honorably discharged. He has been married since 2005 and has one child. He \nworked for a federal contractor from October 2016 to May 2018. (Items 2, 3) \nFrom September 2014 to September 2016 Applicant was employed by the U.S. \nPostal Service (USPS) as a mail carrier. From about April 2016 to August 9, 2016 he \nopened mail entrusted to him for delivery and stole items he found inside. On about \nAugust 9, 2016, USPS agents approached his mail carrier vehicle, observed that he had \nopened an envelope containing cash, and informed him that they had surveillance video \nof him opening mail and removing items. He then admitted that he had been stealing \npieces of mail from his assigned carrier routes since about April 2016. He estimated that \nhe had opened approximately 100 pieces of mail per week and removed gift cards he \nfound therein. He said that he had no reason for taking the gift cards other than he had \nmade poor decisions and exercised bad judgement. He resigned from the USPS in lieu \nof being fired in September 2016. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5). \nIn October 2016, Applicant was hired by a federal contractor. In approximately \nJanuary 2017, he received a written warning for improperly using a mailing label \npurchased by his employer for personal mail. He said that he intended to pay for the \npersonal mail, and thought he had erased the company account number from the pre-\npaid USPS label before he printed it out so that the company would not be charged for \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nshipping.

He also said that he had no other employment difficulties with that employer, and \nthat there was no likelihood of recurrence. (Items 3, 4) \nOn February 3, 2017, Applicant voluntarily surrendered to federal authorities and \nwas arrested. He was arraigned by a Magistrate Judge on one count of \u201cTheft of Mail \nMatter by [USPS] Officer or Employee,\u201d a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71709. The Magistrate \nJudge also scheduled trial on the Theft of Mail charge for April 3, 2017. (Items 4, 5) \nOn March 2, 2017, Applicant completed an e-QIP. In Section 22 of the e-QIP titled \n\u201cPolice Record,\u201d he denied that he had been charged with any crime in the past seven \nyears, and denied that he was then awaiting trial on criminal charges. In response to \nquestions about \u201cEmployment Activities,\u201d he disclosed that he resigned from the USPS in \nSeptember 2016, but denied that he quit after being told he would be fired and denied \nthat he left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct. He also \ndenied that he had received a written warning from his then federal contractor employer. \n(Item 3) \nOn April 17, 2017, Applicant pled guilty to Theft of Mail by a USPS employee. On \nAugust 14, 2017, he was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation, ordered to pay restitution \ntotaling $75, and fined $2,000. (Items 4, 5) \nDuring an August 21, 2017 interview with a government investigator, Applicant \ndiscussed his March 2017 e-QIP. He said that his failure to disclose that he had been \ncharged with a crime was due to an oversight. He also attributed his failure to disclose \nthat he had resigned from the USPS by mutual agreement following charges or \nallegations of misconduct to an oversight. He noted that he had no other employment \ndifficulties with the USPS, that there was no likelihood of recurrence, and that his federal \ncontractor employer was aware of the USPS incident. He reported that the only difficulty \nhe had experienced with his federal contractor employer was the written warning for \nimproperly using a company purchased mailing label for personal mail, and that there \nwas no likelihood of recurrence of that behavior. (Item 4)  \nAn incident report dated February 13, 2018 and prepared by security personnel for \nhis federal contractor employer notes that Applicant: \u201cwas found guilty of two separate \ncharges in two separate incidents . . . is not forthcoming regarding his convictions for \ncriminal activity [and] has not reported any of this data.\u201d The incident report references \ntwo criminal convictions and sentences. First, the conviction and sentence for Theft of \nMail Matter by a USPS employee (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Second, \u201cCharge \u2013 Make Utter Issue 150 \n[Dollars] or over Plea Agreement Filed. Sentence imposed \u2013 [February 13, 2018] 2 years\u2019 \nprobation.\u201d He subsequently admitted that in May 2018, his federal contractor employer \nterminated his employment because he \u201cwas not . . . forthcoming regarding [his] \nconvictions for criminal activity\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.a).

He acknowledged that his \nresponses were inaccurate and noted that if he had gone back and reviewed his answers, \nhe would have corrected his responses. Applicant did not submit any other documents or \nevidence with his answer, and did not submit a response to the FORM. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nThe standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to \nsensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security. SEAD 4, \u00b6 E.4. A person who seeks access to sensitive \ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated \nupon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in \nthe adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of national security. The \nGovernment must present substantial evidence to establish controverted facts \nalleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it \nnever shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. \n22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for assignment to a \npublic trust position. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish that he was \narrested for a federal crime (Theft of Mail by USPS Employee) in February 2017, \nthat he was convicted of that offense in April 2017, and that in August 2017 he was \nsentenced to five years\u2019 probation, ordered to pay $75 restitution, and fined $2,000. \nAG \u00b6 31(b) applies. AG \u00b6 31(c) does not apply because he was granted early \nrelease from federal probation in February 2020. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNeither mitigating condition is fully established. There is mitigating information \nincluding that the criminal behavior alleged occurred more than five years before the SOR \nwas issued, and there is some evidence of successful rehabilitation including Applicant\u2019s \ncompliance with the terms of his federal probation resulting in early release in February \n2020, apparent payment of the court-ordered restitution and fine, and the absence of any \nevidence of criminal activity since his release from federal probation. However, Applicant \nhas not provided sufficient evidence to fully establish either mitigating condition and his \ncriminal and subsequent conduct do not support a conclusion that the security concerning \nbehavior is unlikely to recur and cast doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nHis criminal conduct was not a single, isolated incident and raises substantial \nquestions about his current reliability and trustworthiness. Over a period of more than \nthree months he opened approximately 100 pieces of mail per week that had been \nentrusted to him to deliver and stole items of value he found therein. Approximately five \nmonths after he resigned from the USPS because of that misconduct he was reprimanded \nby another employer for using a prepaid USPS label to send personal mail. The following \nmonth he was arrested and arraigned before a Magistrate Judge on the charge of Theft \nof Mail by a USPS Employee, but one month later he denied that he had any recent \ncriminal history in his e-QIP. Approximately six months after he was sentenced for \nstealing from the mail, he was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation for a separate offense \ninvolving a financial instrument. Although the financial instrument offense was not alleged \nin the SOR and details of the criminal conduct are unclear, the available evidence reflects \nthat he was sentenced in February 2018 to two years\u2019 probation after pleading guilty to a \ncriminal offense. His conduct casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. The above mitigating information is insufficient to dispel the criminal \nconduct security concern. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

During his background interview and in response to the SOR he said that his \nfailure to answer these questions correctly was an unintentional oversight. Considering \nthe record evidence, I do not find his claim credible. He engaged in a pattern of deception \nregarding his criminal history and other conduct reasonably likely to adversely impact \nadjudication of his e-QIP. First, the criminal history that he denied and did not disclose \nwas that while employed as a USPS mail carrier, he opened and stole items of value from \nmail he had been entrusted to deliver. Notably, his false e-QIP responses were \napproximately one-month after he had been arraigned on the Theft of Mail charge by a \nfederal Magistrate Judge, and after that judge set dates for his trial on that charge. \nSecond, in another section of his e-QIP he also falsely denied or failed to disclose that he \nhad resigned from the USPS in lieu of being fired after admitting to USPS agents that he \nhad been stealing from the mail. Third, he was later fired by the company that employed \nhim when he submitted his e-QIP because he was not forthcoming about that same Theft \nof Mail offense and a separate crime. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts, and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct cannot be looked at on an individual or piecemeal basis. \nWhile employed as a mail carrier he opened hundreds of pieces of mail weekly and stole \nitems of value he found therein over a period of more than three months. After being \ncaught by investigators and confessing his misconduct, he resigned from the USPS in \nlieu of being fired. He then went to work for a federal contractor and within four months \nwas caught using a company prepaid USPS label to send personal mail. Approximately \na month later he was arrested and charged for his multiple thefts from the U.S. mail while \nemployed as a mail carrier and trial on that charge was set for three months later. Yet \napproximately one month later, he deliberately failed to disclose anything about the Theft \nof Mail charge or his then pending trial in his e-QIP. He also falsely denied that his \ndeparture from the USPS had anything to do with a pending termination action or following \nallegations of misconduct. More than one year later, his federal contractor employer \nterminated his employment because he failed to be forthcoming about his conviction for \nstealing from the mail and a separate financial crime. \nHe has presented insufficient evidence of prompt, good-faith efforts to correct any \nomission, concealment or falsification before being confronted with the facts, and the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nrecord reveals none. Collectively, his conduct reveals an individual who repeatedly \nshowed an unwillingness to comply with the law, rules, and regulations; who exercised \npoor judgment; and who engaged in criminal or deceptive behavior, and failed to accept \nresponsibility for his actions. Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating factors are insufficient to dispel \nthe personal conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered that Applicant is 42 years old and that he was honorably discharged \nfrom the Army after approximately 15 years of service. He has provided no documentary \nevidence and did not respond to the FORM with relevant and material facts about his \ncircumstances, which may have helped to rebut, extenuate, mitigate, or explain the \nsecurity concerns. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

The drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. Clearance \neligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 28, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The DCSA CAF explained in the SOR why it \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, applicable to all \nadjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \nOn October 8, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On \nMarch 16, 2022, the Government indicated it was ready to proceed to a hearing. On April \n11, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with \nthe interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I \nreceived the case assignment and file on April 18, 2022. After some coordination of \nschedules with the parties, on July 7, 2022, I scheduled an in-person hearing for August \n18, 2022. \nAt the hearing, convened as scheduled, Department Counsel appeared via video \nteleconference while Applicant appeared in person. Before the presentation of any \nevidence, the Government withdrew the Guideline E allegation. Two Government exhibits \n(GE 1-2) were admitted into evidence without any objections. A March 16, 2022 letter from \na DOHA Department Counsel, forwarding copies of then-proposed GEs 1-2 to Applicant, \nwas received but not marked for the record as Applicant confirmed he received the \nexhibits. Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on \nAugust 26, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe amended SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and \npurchased (SOR \u00b6 1.b) marijuana with varying frequency from August 2019 to present, \nincluding after he completed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(hereafter SF 86) on April 12, 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and he intends to continue to use \nmarijuana in the future (SOR \u00b6 1.d).

(Tr. 16.) In March 2014, he began \nworking for his current employer, a defense contractor. (GE 1; Tr.15.) \nNeeding a security clearance for a new project with his employer, Applicant \ncompleted an SF 86 on April 12, 2021. (GE 1; Tr. 13.) In response to an SF 86 inquiry \nconcerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years, Applicant reported that he engaged \nin recreational marijuana use between August 2019 and April 2021. He described the \nfrequency of his use as \u201c[d]aily partial smoking of a marijuana joint outside/after the work \nday.\u201d He responded \u201cYes\u201d as to his intent regarding future use of the drug and explained \nthat adult recreational use is legal in his state. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to an SF 86 inquiry \ninto any illegal drug activity, including any involvement in the illegal purchase of a drug or \ncontrolled substance in the last seven years. (GE 1.) \nOn July 20, 2021, Applicant had a personal subject interview (PSI) with an \nauthorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant \nexplained that he began using marijuana in August 2019, when it became legal to do so in \nhis state, and that he continued to use it daily since then. He used the drug to relax after \nwork either alone in his residence or with friends at social gatherings in the friends\u2019 homes. \nHe stated that he planned to continue to use it, even if granted a security clearance, as he \ndid not want to alter his lifestyle and especially because it is legal in his state. When \nadvised that use of marijuana was not allowed while having access to sensitive or \nclassified information on a federal contract, Applicant stated that he would still continue to \nuse marijuana, as he had been candid about his use on his SF 86 and during his PSI. \nApplicant reported that he had purchased marijuana three to five times, spending about \n$100 per occasion, from legal dispensaries in his state since August 2019. He added that \nhe has been gifted some marijuana from a friend who grows the drug and \u201chas so much of \nit.\u201d He accepted the drug from his friend only since his state legalized the possession and \nuse of marijuana. (GE 2.) \nIn response to DOHA drug interrogatories, Applicant disclosed on September 7, \n2021, that he used marijuana daily from August 2019 to September 2021, and that he \nintended to continue using marijuana. He admitted that he associates with persons who \nuse marijuana or frequents places where marijuana is used and added, \u201cwhen visiting \nsome friends\u2019 houses, (once a week or less) [and] concerts (3-4 times a year).\u201d He stated \nthat he does not use any other illegal substance under federal law and would not do so. He \nresponded affirmatively regarding any purchases, and stated that he purchased cannabis \noccasionally from state \u201crecreational/adult-use facilities spending around $100.\u201d He did not \nrecall the specific date of his last purchase other than that it was in 2021. Applicant \nexpressed his intention to continue to use cannabis in accord with state law; to purchase it \noccasionally from licensed retailers; and to receive gifts of the drug, and added, \u201cThere \nwould be no purchase, sale, or use of any other drugs.\u201d (GE 2.) \nAt his hearing, Applicant explained that he was first introduced to marijuana while \nsocializing with a friend who is in a reggae band. (Tr. 20.) He continues to \u201cenjoy cannabis \nin a very small way, off work, never during work hours.\u201d (Tr. 13.) His use of marijuana \noccurred only in states where adult recreational use is legal. (Tr. 17.)

He intends to continue to use marijuana, knowing that it remains the DOD\u2019s \nposition that marijuana use is incompatible with holding a security clearance. (Tr. 19-21.) \nHe does not believe that his off-duty use of cannabis adversely affects his ability to handle \nsensitive or classified information. (Tr. 14.) He asserted that he would never use marijuana \nat work and not while working with classified information. (Tr. 14, 21-22.) He does not \nperceive his drug use as compromising his trustworthiness and ability to safeguard \nsensitive information. (Tr. 22.) His manager is aware that he uses marijuana. The manager \ntold him it would be in his best interest to stop using marijuana but did not tell him that he \nwould be required to cease his marijuana use to obtain a clearance. (Tr. 22-23.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that on December 15, 2016, the state where \nApplicant lives and works legalized the use, purchase, possession, or manufacture of one \nounce or less of marijuana by adults age 21 years or older. However, marijuana is a \nSchedule I controlled substance under federal law pursuant to Title 21, Section 812 of the \nUnited States Code. Schedule I drugs are those which have a high potential for abuse; \nhave no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and lack \naccepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. Section 844 under Title 21 \nof the United States Code makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally \npossess a controlled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid prescription. \nOn October 25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nguidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or \ndecriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law or the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security eligibility determinations. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, the current DNI issued clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana, noting that prior recreational use of marijuana by an individual may \nbe relevant to security adjudications, but is not determinative in the whole-person \nevaluation. Relevant factors in mitigation include the frequency of use and whether the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur. The DNI also made clear \nthat products that contain more than 0.3 percent of THC remain illegal to use under federal \nlaw and policy. \nApplicant has used marijuana primarily daily to relax after work since August 2019. \nHe candidly acknowledged that he intends to continue using marijuana, despite knowing \nthat it could result in denial of a security clearance and that it remains illegal under federal \nlaw. He has purchased marijuana on occasion from legal retailers in his state since August \n2019. The following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 apply: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply with \nrespect to his drug activity that is illegal under federal law. AG \u00b6 26 provides for mitigation \nas follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \n6 \n\n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has not established any \nabstinence from marijuana use. Appendix B of the AGs provides that an individual who is \nan unlawful user of a controlled substance or is an addict is statutorily prohibited from \nholding a security clearance. There is no evidence that Applicant is an addict. There is no \nevidence that his off-duty use of marijuana has adversely affected his work. Yet, given the \ndaily frequency of his use and his intention to continue using marijuana in the future, the \nstatutory prohibition regarding unlawful users of a controlled substance applies. The \nlegality of his marijuana use under state law does not alter existing federal law prohibiting \nthe possession of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s candor about his marijuana involvement does not \njustify his ongoing disregard of federal laws concerning the use and possession of \ndangerous controlled substances. It is not enough in mitigation that he will avoid using \nmarijuana in any work capacity or before reporting for work. None of the mitigating \nconditions are established with regard to his marijuana uses and purchases. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe Government must be assured that those persons granted access to classified \ninformation can be counted on to fulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, \nregulations, and policies, including federal drug laws and security clearance requirements. \nMarijuana use is part of Applicant\u2019s daily routine. He continued to use and purchase \nmarijuana while a full-time defense-contractor employee and after he applied for a DOD \nsecurity clearance. He is unwilling to cease using and possessing marijuana, despite \nknowing of the DOD\u2019s security concerns and the federal prohibition. It is well settled that \nonce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). For the reasons previously discussed, \nconcerns persist about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nWITHDRAWN \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

(SOR 1.a) SOR 1.b is established by Applicant\u2019s stated \nintention not to use marijuana or any other federally illegal drugs in the future, (\u201cunless \nnot granted a clearance, probably will try again at some point.\u201d). (Item 4 at 9-10, 12-13) \nSOR 1.c \u2013 In January 2007, Applicant was arrested for driving while under the \ninfluence of marijuana. He was driving home after having used marijuana with a former \nfriend, and was stopped for by police for failing to yield at a stop sign. In September \n2007, Applicant pled guilty and was fined $3,500. He was sentenced to three days in \njail. He noted that if he was not granted a security clearance, he would possibly \ncontinue to use marijuana. Applicant claimed that, except for his father who also uses \nmarijuana, he does not socialize or work with anyone involved in criminal activity. (Item \n4 at 6-7) \nSOR 1.d \u2013 In February 2011, Applicant and his girlfriend at the time were \nparked in a bar parking lot when police drove in behind them. Upon sensing the police \npresence, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend became rattled and announced there was marijuana in \ntheir car and she did not want to go to jail. The police charged Applicant with driving \nwhile under the influence of marijuana and issued him a ticket to appear in court. He \nwas not arrested. He pled guilty to driving while under the influence of marijuana. He \nwas sentenced to 12 months of probation and ordered to pay a fine, but he could not \nrecall the amount. He also attended one drug counseling session which he completed. \nThe only change Applicant made in his life after the February 2011 incident was \nterminating the relationship with his girlfriend who was with him in the bar parking lot. \n(Item 7-8) \nSOR 1.e \u2013 In 2014, while Applicant was living with his parents, the police \nsearched his room and found marijuana. He was cited for possession of marijuana. In \ncourt he pled guilty to the charge. He paid a fine, but could not recall the amount. There \nis no indication in the record that he was sentenced or placed on probation. (Item 4 at 8-\n9) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available \nand reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \n3 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse \nof prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such \nbehavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because \nit raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nIn my analysis of this case, I have taken administrative notice of Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 12564 signed by the then-President of the United States on September 15, \n1986. The primary issues addressed in the E.O. are: (1) federal employees cannot use \nillegal drugs; (2) illegal drug use by federal employees, on or off duty, is contrary to the \nefficiency of the service; an (3) persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for federal \nemployment. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and \nsubstance abuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue such use.  \nApplicant began using marijuana in 2001. In his November 2020 e-QIP, he \ndescribed his marijuana use as random to social, probably a few times monthly between \n2001 and November 2020. In his January 2021 PSI, his last use of marijuana was in \nDecember 2020. In the drug chart included with his October 2021 answers to \ninterrogatories, Applicant disclosed that his last use of marijuana was in October 2021. \nHis use falls within the scope of AG \u00b6 25(a). Even though he may not have purchased \nthe drug, AG \u00b6 25(c) applies because he still had to possess or have control over the \ndrug to use it. \nThroughout the security investigation, Applicant indicated that it was likely that \nhe would use marijuana in the future. In his November 2020 e-QIP, he stated he would \nuse marijuana in the future as he believed that marijuana use would soon be legalized. \nIn his January 2021 PSI, Applicant stated he would possibly use marijuana in the future \nif his security clearance was not granted. In his October 2021 answers to \ninterrogatories, he indicated he would not use marijuana in the future unless his security \nclearance was not granted, in which case he would probably use the drug at some \npoint. Applicant\u2019s unconditional affirmative response to SOR 1.b to continue using the \ndrug if not granted a security clearance, brings his behavior within the scope of AG \u00b6 \n25(g). \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does \nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs \nwere used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain \nfrom \nall \ndrug \ninvolvement \nand \nsubstance \nmisuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana abuse began in 2001 and is still ongoing. There is a \nstrong likelihood he will continue to use marijuana in the future. Given his long history of \nmarijuana use, his conduct raises significant residual concerns about his \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nThough Applicant admits his marijuana involvement, he has furnished no \nevidence of action taken to overcome his illegal drug use, with an objective directed at \nabstinence from the drug. With no evidence from Applicant showing that he has severed \nhis contacts with his drug-using associates, primarily his father, AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) does not \napply. Terminating interaction with drug-using associates usually means avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs are used. Applicant has made no effort to reduce or stop his \nmarijuana use at his house or his parents\u2019 house. AG \u00b6 26(b)(2) does not apply. Lastly, \nthe record contains no signed statement of intent by Applicant that any future drug \ninvolvement will constitute grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3) is inapplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has illegally used marijuana for the past 20 years. Even though he \nhas been placed on notice in 2020 and 2021 that illegal drug use is inconsistent with \nholding a security clearance, his statements show that he intends to continue illegal \ndrug use in the future. Based on Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of illegal marijuana use with \nno attempt to reduce or stop use, the three drug-related incidents, the lack of evidence \nindicating separation from drug users and corresponding environments, Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns arising from the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j-1.t. Her admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old administrative assistant employed by a defense \ncontractor since August 2007. She has held a security clearance since November 2017. \nShe married in April 1999 and separated in June 2013. Her husband initiated the \nseparation. (Tr. 16.) Applicant does not know where he works or what he does, and she \navoids contact with him. (Tr. 50.) She has a 20-year-old son who is a college student and \nlives with her. (Tr. 15.) She took courses from an on-line university for three months in \n2006 and attended a technical university from March 2010 to February 2012, but she has \nnot received a degree. (GX 1 at 9-10.). \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent consumer debts, six delinquent student loans, \nand six delinquent medical bills. It also alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2016, that her wages \nwere garnished twice for delinquent student loans and once for a delinquent account with \na military exchange, and that on one occasion she improperly used her employer\u2019s credit \ncard for personal expenses. The delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are reflected in \ncredit reports from January 2007, June 2020 (two reports), March 2021, and October \n2022. (GX 3-6 and 8.) The evidence concerning the allegations in the SOR is summarized \nbelow. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: debt placed for collection of $10,522. Around 2019, Applicant \nobtained a loan to pay off some of her other debts. She made the payments for about a \nyear, until she was hospitalized for blood clots. About $2,500 of her medical expenses \nwere not covered by insurance. (Tr. 27-29.) In response to DCSA interrogatories and the \nSOR, Applicant admitted this debt but disputed the amount. In her SOR answer, she \nstated that she attempted to make a payment agreement, but the creditor wanted monthly \npayments that she could not afford. (GX 2 at 21.) At the hearing, she testified that she \npaid $541 on this debt and began paying $100 per month about two weeks before the \nhearing. (Tr. 30.) She did not provide any documentation of these payments or a payment \nagreement. The debt is not resolved. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f and 1.i: student loans placed for collection of $3,633; $2,011; \n$1,550; $1,462; $1,182; and $830. Applicant testified that her student loans originally \ntotaled about $23,000. In May 2016 and March 2017, her pay was garnished for $222 per \npay period for her delinquent student loans. (GX 9; GX 10 at 4.) As of August 2018, she \nowned $23,780, and she was paying $5.00 per month. (GX 7; GX 8.) On a date not \nreflected in the record, she stopped making the monthly $5.00 payments.

She believes that $19,080 was collected \nby garnishment, and that she now owes about $12,900. (Tr. 19.) The garnishment has \nbeen paused due to COVID-19. (Tr. 23.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: credit-card debt placed for collection of $944. In Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to DCSA interrogatories, Applicant stated that she had arranged to pay $30 \nevery two weeks, beginning in March 2021, until the debt was paid in full. (GX 2 at 23.) \nAt the hearing, she testified that the debt was paid in full. (Tr. 33.) She submitted \ndocumentation of payments to this creditor in March, April, and May of 2021, but the \naccount number and amount do not match the debt alleged in the SOR and reflected in \nthe credit reports in the record. The October 2022 credit report reflects that the balance \non this debt has been reduced to $584 and the last payment was in August 2021. (GX 11 \nat 2.) The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.o, 1.r, and 1.s: medical bills placed for collection of \n$903, $717, $623, $378, $25, and $171. In response to DCSA interrogatories, Applicant \nstated that one of these debts is not valid and the others are her estranged husband\u2019s \nresponsibility for their son\u2019s medical bills. (GX 2 at 24; Tr. 36-40.) She provided no \ndocumentation to support her testimony. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q: consumer debts placed for collection of $489, \n$463, $345, and $314. Applicant testified that she made payment agreements for these \nfour debts and they had been paid in full. She provided documentation for settlement of \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, and 1.p, but her documentation for the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.q has a different account number than the debt alleged in the SOR. The debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m and 1.p are resolved but the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q is not \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: telecommunication debt placed for collection of $409. Applicant \ntestified that she disputed this debt because it was for something that she did not order. \nShe had not received a response to her dispute, and she had not followed up as of the \ndate of the hearing. (Tr. 43-44.) She provided no documentary evidence of the basis for \nher dispute or efforts to resolve it. \nSOR \u00b6 1.t: failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2014 through 2016.

She submitted wage \nand income transcripts for 2014 and 2016, but they do not reflect that the federal return \nfor 2016 was filed. She provided no evidence that any of the past-due state tax returns \nhad been filed. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u and 1.v: wage garnishment for delinquent student loans. This \ngarnishment is for the delinquent student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6.1.b-1.f, and 1.i. In 2017, \n$252 per two-week pay period was collected. The collection per pay period was $255 in \n2018 and $265 in 2019. (AX A, B, and C.) In Applicant\u2019s response to DCSA \ninterrogatories, she stated that about $20,540 was collected by garnishment. (GX 2 at \n14.) The collection by garnishment was paused due to COVID-19. \nSOR \u00b6 1.w: improper use of employer\u2019s credit card in June 2017. Applicant \nadmitted using a company travel card to buy gasoline on one occasion. She testified at \nthe hearing that she was out of gas and did not have the money pay for it. She self-\nreported it and paid the bill as soon as it was due. (Tr. 48.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.x: wage garnishment for delinquent balance of $14,513 on a military \nexchange credit card that was placed for collection. Applicant testified that she and \nher husband obtained this credit card while he was on active duty. She was unaware of \nthe debt until she was notified of the garnishment. (GX 9; Tr. 49.) She believes that the \ncollection agency targeted her for collection because they could not find her husband. (Tr. \n50.) She submitted documentary evidence reflecting a payment of $682 and a balance \ndue of $2,445 as of October 7, 2022. (AX D.) She anticipates that the debt will be paid in \nfull in about four months. (Tr. 51.) \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement when she responded to DCSA \ninterrogatories. It reflected net monthly income of about $3,928, monthly expenses of \nabout $2,350, and debt payments of about $395. She has a monthly car payment of $350 \nand a credit card with a balance of $1,500, on which she pays $50 per month. Her \nestranged husband owns the home that she rents for $400 per month. (GX 2 at 17.) If \nthese numbers are accurate, she has a net monthly remainder of about $1,183. \nA coworker, who has known Applicant since 2007 and is familiar with her family \nsituation, has observed her as she continues to \u201croll with the punches of life.\u201d He considers \nher loyal, dedicated, and trustworthy.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe garnishments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u and 1.v were imposed to collect the \nstudent loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f, and 1.i. As such, they duplicate SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f \nand 1.i. When the same conduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under the same \nguideline, the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, \nI have resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u and 1.v for Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established for the misuse of the credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.w. It \nwas an isolated incident that happened five years ago under unusual circumstances. \nApplicant promptly self-reported it and paid it as soon as it was due. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \nestablished for the other debts alleged in the SOR. They are numerous, recent, and were \nnot incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s medical debts, her marital \nseparation, and her husband\u2019s neglect of the debt to the military exchange were \nconditions largely beyond here control. She has settled the consumer debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.l, 1.m, and 1.p and has been making payments on the military exchange debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.x, but she has not acted responsibly regarding the other debts alleged in the \nSOR. After entering a rehabilitation program for her delinquent student loans, she stopped \nmaking payments and relied on involuntary garnishment to pay them. Her student loans \nwere delinquent before the COVID-19 forbearance went into effect. Accordingly, there is \na continuing concern that she will not make payments on her student loans when they \nare no longer in forbearance.  \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.x, \nbut not for the other debts alleged in the SOR. She stopped making payments on the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g in August 2021. She provided no documentary evidence showing \nthat her husband was solely responsible for their son\u2019s medical bills. She provided no \nevidence showing that one of the medical bills was invalid.

She has relied on involuntary garnishment for the student \nloans alleged in SOR 1.b-1.f, and 1.i. Payment by involuntary garnishment is not a good-\nfaith effort to resolve debts. ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. She provided no documentary evidence to support \nher assertion that one of the medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.o, 1.r, and 1.s \nwas invalid, no documentary evidence to show that her husband was responsible for their \nson\u2019s medical bills, and no documentary evidence to show the basis for disputing the \ntelecommunication debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not fully established. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant provided \nevidence that the 2014 and 2015 federal tax returns were filed and the taxes due were \npaid. She provided no evidence that she had filed the 2016 federal returns. She provided \nno evidence that any of the past-due state tax returns had been filed. Failure to file tax \nreturns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established \ngovernmental rules and systems and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules \nand regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets. ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant has worked for her currently employer and held a security \nclearance for many years. She was candid and sincere at the hearing, but she clearly is \nnot in control of her financial situation. She has reacted passively and erratically, and has \nno clear plan to regain financial stability.

He was unemployed from October 2019 to May 2020, and he previously worked as a test conductor for the same company from July 2007 to October 2019. He graduated from high school in 2000 and obtained a truck driving school certification in 2007. He married in 2012 and divorced in 2017. He has three children with whom he shares custody. He has held security clearances since 2008. The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has seven delinquent debts totaling about $76,826 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g). Under Guideline G, The SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in 2010, charged, and convicted of driving while intoxicated (DUI) and he was placed on probation for three years, fined and required to participate in a three-month alcohol treatment program (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and that he was arrested, charged, and convicted of DUI in 2018, sentenced to one-day confinement, probation for 11 months and 29 days, fined, court costs, and was required to participate in an alcohol treatment program (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted the SOR allegations without explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence support the SOR allegations.

The Government\u2019s \nwritten brief with supporting documents, known as the file of relevant material (FORM), \nwas submitted by Department Counsel on February 2, 2022. A complete copy of the \nFORM was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material to refute, rebut, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant responded to \nthe FORM by submitting two account statements that were admitted without objection. \nHe did not object to the Government\u2019s exhibits. The case was assigned to me on April 12, \n2022. Government Exhibits (GE) 2 and 8 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nGE 1 is the SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer, which are already part of the record. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 40-year-old mechanical technician, employed by a defense \ncontractor since 2020. He was unemployed from October 2019 to May 2020, and he \npreviously worked as a test conductor for the same company from July 2007 to October \n2019. He graduated from high school in 2000 and obtained a truck driving school \ncertification in 2007. He married in 2012 and divorced in 2017. He has three children with \nwhom he shares custody. He has held security clearances since 2008. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has seven delinquent debts \ntotaling about $76,826 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g). Under Guideline G, The SOR alleges that \nApplicant was arrested in 2010, charged, and convicted of driving while intoxicated (DUI) \nand he was placed on probation for three years, fined and required to participate in a \nthree-month alcohol treatment program (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and that he was arrested, charged, \nand convicted of DUI in 2018, sentenced to one-day confinement, probation for 11 months \nand 29 days, fined, court costs, and was required to participate in an alcohol treatment \nprogram (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted the SOR allegations without explanations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence support the SOR allegations. \nIn Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) by a Government investigator in \nSeptember 2020, he stated that his financial difficulties arose while he was traveling for \nhis employer and he turned over his finances to a live-in girlfriend suffering from bipolar \ndisorder. He claimed that once he discovered the delinquent accounts, he terminated his \nrelationship and began making payments on his past-due accounts. Applicant stated his \nintent to resolve all of his debts. He has not sought financial counseling. \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, he noted that his financial problems began in January 2018. \nHe was warned by his company in April 2020 that he had unresolved debts. He stated \nthat he \u201cdid some research and figured these charges were due to my ex.\u201d (SCA) He \ncompleted a financial interrogatory in June 2021 wherein he responded to each debt listed \nin the SOR. (GE 6) With one exception, he admitted that each account was unpaid, with \nno payment arrangements or payments applied. He did not attach any documents related \nto the accounts except one. The exception was an account with a collection agent (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d) that he noted was a duplicate of an account listed by the original creditor, but not \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nalleged in the SOR. As explained below, the collection account remains unresolved. He \nalso provided a portion of a checking account summary in which he claimed that he had \ncashier\u2019s checks issued to unlisted creditors totaling over $10,000, and employer pay \nstubs showing regular pay in February 2021, and overtime wages in May 2021. The \nsummary is of little value as it does not list the creditors to whom payments were made. \nFinally, he provided a personal financial statement showing no payments toward SOR \ndebts, no bank savings, $5,000 in investments, and a car. He has $300 in net monthly \nremainder after paying monthly expenses. He noted that he is working overtime in order \nto pay a lump sum on the collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, as noted below. \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant supplied a document from the creditor that \nappears to correspond to SOR \u00b6 1.a, a credit-card company debt for $22,005. The \ndocument shows the account is cancelled with an outstanding balance of $21,443, with \npartial payments of varying amounts made from March to July 2022. Applicant\u2019s 2020 \ncredit bureau report (CBR) shows the account was charged off in July 2020 and closed \nby the credit grantor. (GE 4) Applicant\u2019s March 2021 CBR shows the last activity on the \naccount in April 2018. \nApplicant also supplied a document from a creditor that appears to correspond to \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, a charged-off credit-card account for approximately $16,746. The document \nis an account statement from June 2021 for an account by the same creditor but with a \npartial account number that does not match the account in SOR \u00b6 1.b, as supported by \nCBRs in the record. Applicant\u2019s March 2021 CBR shows the last activity on the account \nwas in April 2018. The statement shows a zero balance on a closed account with the last \npayment of $1,766.93 in June 2020. Applicant partially redacted the full account number \non the document he submitted, and it does little to mitigate SOR \u00b6 1.b as it is impossible \nto determine, without more information, whether it is the same account as alleged in the \nSOR. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 Collection account for approximately $10,502. In Applicant\u2019s response \nto financial interrogatories, he noted that he had a payment plan for this account. The \ndocument he sent to support the payment plan was an offer to repay the account to the \ncollection agent in two separate payment plans. He noted on the document that he has \nsaved $2,500 so far, and intends to save $6,000 to apply to one of the offered options; \nhowever, no documentation of payment was offered. The account is not resolved. \nNo other documents were submitted regarding efforts to resolve the SOR debts, \npayment plans, or financial counseling. Applicant stated in his response to interrogatories \nthat his debts arose from his former girlfriend not paying bills and maximizing charges on \nhis credit cards while he was traveling for ten months for his company (he did not disclose \nthe dates of travel). He noted that he was previously debt free with a good credit score. \nHe reiterated that he has paid over $10,000 toward debts, but did not disclose to whom \nthe payments were made. He takes responsibility for the debts and is determined to \nresolve them, but 2021 was a difficult year because of his mother\u2019s relocation to another \nstate. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested, charged, and convicted of DUI in 2010 and 2018.

He noted \u201ceverything has been taken care of and resolved,\u201d and that he \ncompleted alcohol classes in January 2011.

He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor (second degree) DUI, \nand was sentenced to one-year probation, fined, and was to complete three months of \nalcohol-abuse classes. He said he completed all of the court\u2019s requirements, including \ncompleting the alcohol classes in January 2019. (SCA, GEs 7 and 8) He did not provide \ndocumentary information on the status of his probation, the type or frequency of the \nalcohol classes he attended or certifications of their completion, or evidence showing \ncompletion of individual alcohol-related counseling or treatment program. Since 2018, he \ncontinues to drink socially, about two drinks every two weeks. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record are sufficient \nto establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant incurred debts related to a poor decision to allow his live-in girlfriend to \nhandle his finances while he was traveling for his employer. He did not explain why he \ndid not supervise the payments of bills, track credit-card charges, and ensure timely debt \npayments while he was traveling. He noted the debts were incurred in 2018, and he was \nwarned by his employer to resolve them in 2020. He also did not explain why he did not \ntake measures to address the debts when they were incurred, or after he was warned by \nhis employer. His only efforts to address the SOR debts were apparently in March to July \n2022, when he made irregular payments toward the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He is \ncredited with such payments, but has not shown a sufficient track record of consistent \npayments to overcome his delay in addressing the debt.

ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May \n30, 2018). \nApplicant also claims to have made $10,000 in other debt payments, but he did \nnot explain to whom the payments were made and whether he resolved any other debts. \nWhen an applicant claims that a debt has been paid, it is reasonable to expect him or her \nto present documentary evidence supporting that claim. ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). In addition, he has not sought financial counseling or \nprofessional assistance with resolving his financial issues. \nThe guideline encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and \nother qualities essential to protecting classified information. A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). Applicant claimed that his former girlfriend failed to pay debts and over-charged \nhis credit cards is not a condition that was out of his control. He failed to supervise the \nprompt, correct payment of bills, and did not take timely action to determine whether his \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts were being paid or to address unpaid accounts when discovered. I am not \npersuaded that he was an innocent victim, or that he took appropriate action to resolve \nthe issues when he should have known they existed. He has not shown sufficient \nevidence of responsible actions to address his financial matters. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to determine that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period and that he has shown he can \nmaintain a measure of financial responsibility. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his \nor her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s financial issues continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. No mitigation credit \nfully applies to the debts in question. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s has two alcohol related driving incidents, including DUI convictions in \n2010 and 2018. His second offense occurred after he attended a three-month alcohol \nabuse class required after his first DUI conviction. These incidents meet the conditions \nset forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a). \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23, including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption of \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has two alcohol-related arrests and convictions, the last in 2018. \nAlthough significant time may have passed between these incidents, the fact that \nApplicant attended alcohol-related classes while on probation from his 2010 DUI, and \nagain drove after drinking alcohol in 2018, raises cause for concern. I am not persuaded \nthat his alcohol consumption has changed to the extent that a recurrence of alcohol-\nrelated incidents is unlikely. There is insufficient evidence demonstrating a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption; or that he has shown an interest in obtaining \na medical evaluation or attending an effective alcohol treatment program given his history \nof alcohol-related driving incidents. There is a paucity of information in the record to \npersuasively show that Applicant\u2019s judgment has improved or that a similar incident is \nunlikely to recur. No mitigation credit is warranted or appropriate to alleviate the alcohol \nconsumption security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and G in my whole-person analysis. There was little \nnew information provided by Applicant to alleviate concerns for his financial responsibility \nand alcohol consumption issues. Since he elected to have a decision based on the \nadministrative record, I was unable to further evaluate his demeanor, sincerity, and \ncredibility, or further inquire into financial and alcohol-related matters. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude he \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \namended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \nGregg A.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accrued delinquent debts, including a repossessed vehicle and a \nforeclosed home, during a period of unemployment and divorce. The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant acknowledges in his Answer he has not resolved any of the debts. He \ncites his spouse for not helping make payments on the mortgage and on one of the auto \nloans. He states his intent to resolve the financial issues and notes his contacts with his \ncreditors. A delinquent debt is not considered mitigated because the creditor has charged \noff the account or repossessed the item. A creditor\u2019s decision to charge off a debt for \naccounting purposes does not affect the debtor\u2019s obligations to the creditor. He did not \nestablish that he \u201cinitiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \nIn his Answer, Applicant denies SOR \u00b6 1.c, stating he paid off his military credit \ncard. His statement is supported by his credit report. (Item 5 at 6.) However, the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is not his military credit card. In his PSI, he identifies the debt as an \noverpayment from his GI Bill. (Item 10 at 8.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEven if they were incurred some time ago, Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are \nongoing and unresolved. He did not establish that his financial problems are in the past \nand are unlikely to recur. He did not establish that he has made a good-faith effort to pay \nor resolve his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s three largest debts are attributable to his divorce and a period of \nunemployment. The two largest SOR debts are his marital home and his auto loan. Both \ndebts arose when he and his spouse separated. The divorce was a circumstance beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. The first prong of \u00b6 20(b) therefore applies. For full consideration \nunder AG \u00b6 20(b), however, Applicant must establish that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He has not done so. The most recent record evidence (a December 2021 \ncredit report) shows that the mortgage and the two auto debts remain past due, as well \nas a minor debt in collection status. \nEven though Applicant\u2019s debts occurred largely due to circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, he did not provide sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is detailed in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(a): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant has ongoing issues with alcohol consumption, as he incurred six alcohol-\nrelated arrests between 2012 and 2020. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. AG \u00b6 22(c) also applies, as \nthe record evidence of the six alcohol-related arrests supports a finding that Applicant \nengaged in recent, habitual consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive\nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment\nrecommendations; \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(c): the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment \nprogram, has no history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d):the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 DWI arrest did not deter his behavior, as he incurred another DWI \nin 2019. His Article 15 punishment by the Army for drunk and disorderly conduct and \nresisting apprehension in 2016 had no impact on his behavior, as he incurred two arrests \nin 2019 and another in 2020 for being intoxicated and disruptive in public. Two of these \narrests included an additional charge of Resisting Public Officer. He admits he had a \ndrinking problem but states he has been sober since September of 2020. He asserts that \nhe has fulfilled all his legal obligations for his 2012 DWI conviction, which included an \nalcohol treatment program, but this is uncorroborated. Even if that were the case, there \nis no indication that he is participating in an ongoing counseling or treatment program to \nrehabilitate his ongoing alcohol issues. His alcohol issues are too recent and too serious \nto be considered mitigated. Given Applicant\u2019s overall pattern and history of alcohol related \nissues, they, too, remain unmitigated. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant\u2019s two DWI convictions, his military offenses, and three arrests after \nleaving the military are cross-alleged under the criminal conduct guideline. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) do not apply for the same reasons set forth under Guideline G, \nabove. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal issues are recent and ongoing. He has taken \nrehabilitative steps by completing his job training requirements. Given the record \nevidence, he needs to establish a much longer record of accomplishment of responsible \nbehavior and compliance with rules, regulations and the law before his criminal conduct \ncan be considered mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, G, and J in my whole-person analysis. While Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies are largely attributable to circumstances beyond his control, they are \nnonetheless unresolved. He incurred an arrest and conviction in 2012 for DWI which had \nno impact on his behavior, as he incurred another DWI in 2019. His Article 15 punishment \nin 2016 for drunk and disorderly conduct and resisting apprehension had no impact on \nhis behavior, as he incurred two arrests in 2019 and another arrest in 2020 for being \nintoxicated and disruptive in public. Two of these alcohol-related arrests included \nadditional charges of resisting a police officer. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines F, G, and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his delinquent debts and his alcohol-related conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM. The case was \nassigned to me on March 3, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 41 years old. He has been an employee for a federal defense company \nsince 1999. He is married and has two children. He graduated from high school in 1998, \nattended community college, but did not receive a degree, and completed a certificate of \ncompletion for a machinist in 2004. He has held his current clearance since 2004. (GX 1) \nHe completed his (SCA) on June 30, 2020. This is his first application for a security \nclearance. (Item 2) \nThe Statement of Reasons alleges under Guideline G, SOR 1.a, on or about April \n14, 2004, he was arrested for DUI Alcohol. He pled guilty, was awarded 90 days of \nconfinement (suspended), three years of probation, loss of license, and fines; under SOR \n1.b, on May 7, 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence \n(DUI) Alcohol, drinking while driving, and unreasonable refusal to submit to a breathalyzer \ntest. He pled guilty and was awarded six months of confinement (suspended), three years \nof probation, loss of license and $500 in fines. Additionally, his license was suspended \nfor one year and he was assigned one year of ignition interlock \nUnder SOR 1.c, Applicant was arrested for DUI on August 31, 2019, found guilty \nand his license was suspended for three years. He was assigned one year of ignition \ninterlock and ordered to attend the Virginia Alcohol and Safety Action Program (VASSP); \nUnder SOR 1.d, Applicant was diagnosed by (CBH) with Alcohol Use Disorder \u2013 \nModerate in 2017 and again in 2020; under SOR 1.e, Applicant continued to consume \nalcohol after the recommendation not to. Applicant admitted to all the SOR allegations. \n(Items 1, 4, 5, and 6) \nAlcohol Consumption \nApplicant has been a social drinker since the age of sixteen while in high school.\nHe would typically drink on the weekends (a six pack of beer). He stated that he would \nhave two drinks in a sitting once per week to three times per month. In a 2020 personal \nsubject interview, Applicant stated that he has never had any problem reducing his \nalcohol consumption. (Item 3) Within the past ten years he has been arrested in alcohol-\nrelated-vehicular incidents three times. Applicant admitted the allegations and provided \nexplanations. (Answer to SOR) \n \nIn his 2020, subject interview Applicant stated that all of his drinking occurred \nduring social situations, and he never felt impaired. After his first and second DUI, he \nslowed down his drinking to one time every other week, and he would have three to four \nbeers each time. He told the investigator he would not drink to intoxication. (Item 3) His \ndrinking increased in later years due to a loss of family members (two grandmothers). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Policies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Answer to SOR) He also stated that he had no intent to stop drinking. (Item 3) He \nunderstands that he has made some bad decisions. (Answer to SOR) \nAs to the allegation under SOR 1.c in 2019, Applicant explained to the investigator \nthat he had six to seven beers, but did not feel impaired. He puts his level of intoxication \n\u201caround a \u201c10\u201d. (Item 3) He felt he could drive after drinking. Applicant took the \nbreathalyzer and field tests. He spent a night in jail and was charged with DUI \u2013 2nd \noffense. Appearing in Court, he was represented by a lawyer, and he pled guilty. He \nreceived 30 days in jail and as noted in the SOR, his license was suspended for three \nyears. He was required to attend ASAP. (Item 3) Applicant is still being monitored under \nASAP until December 2022. (Item 3) \nHe had attended outpatient group counseling. Applicant reported in his DOHA \ninterrogatories that he was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder \u2013Moderate SOR 1.d) \nand that it was recommended that he abstain from alcohol. In his answer, Applicant \nstated that he did not know that he was to abstain from use of alcohol. He also completed \nthe interrogatory by stating that he currently consumes alcohol. (Item 3) SOR 1.e \nCriminal Conduct \nThe SOR (2.c) cross-alleges the information alleged in 1.a through 1.c. Applicant \nadmitted to all SOR allegations in SOR paragraph 1.a-1.c. \nApplicant also admitted to SOR 2.a, that in 2004, he was arrested for possession \nof marijuana. (Items 4-6) He received deferred prosecution after supervised probation \nfor 12 months. He admitted that he has been a regular marijuana user since high school. \nHe did not seek treatment. He claimed that he stopped when he wanted to get a security \nclearance. (Item 3) As to SOR 2.b, in 2018, Applicant was found guilty of not complying \nwith the terms of the VASAP program. He is not currently in any alcohol treatment \ncounseling or meetings. (Item 3) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  Analysis \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Five conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant admitted that he was found guilty of three DUIs in 2004, 2017, and 2019. \nHe showed poor judgment in all cases. He stated that he has learned his lesson. \nHowever, despite spending time in jail and losing his license over the years, he still \nconsumes alcohol. He stated that the later DUIs were due to losing family members. \nHe attended VASAP; he was diagnosed in 2017 and 2020 for alcohol disorder-\nmoderate. Against recommendations, he is not abstaining from drinking alcohol. He is \nbeing monitored by VASAP until December 2022. He also attended an alcohol treatment \ncenter who advised that he abstain from drinking. The incidents that involved alcohol are \ncross-alleged under Guideline J. Applicant admits he misused alcohol but completed \nalcohol treatment in 2018. The fact that he still drinks and asserts that he was not told \nthat he could not drink, is reason to raise doubt about an established pattern of modified \nconsumption of alcohol. His latest incident was in 2019.These facts establish prima facie \nsupport for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shifts the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant does not acknowledge that his drinking has affected his life. He has had \nthree alcohol-related incidents over the years in many years. He did not abide by the \nrecommendation to abstain from drinking. He still consumes some alcohol, although he \nhas modified the amount and frequency. He was vague about when and how much he \ndrinks. It is too early to know if there is an established track record of responsible alcohol \nuse that would not lead to another occurrence. The fact that he continues to drink and \nasserts that he was never told that he could not drink, is reason to raise doubt about an \nestablished pattern of modified consumption of alcohol. His latest incident was in August \n2019. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the alcohol guideline. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \nand \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nAs discussed under Alcohol Consumption, Applicant has three alcohol-related \nvehicular incidents. The latest was in 2020, and he has a criminal conviction for marijuana \npossession. He is still being monitored by the VASAP until December 2022.The evidence \nestablishes the above three disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has not mitigated the alcohol consumption concerns nor the \ncriminal conduct concerns. His pattern of drinking every few years and his various \nexplanations do not convince me of successful rehabilitation. He has been \naddressing his alcohol disorder but it is not unreasonable to expect a longer period \nof time to show that he has fully mitigated the concerns under this guideline. He \nreceives partial credit for his treatment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. He has worked at his current \nemployment for many years. He acknowledged that he is honest and trustworthy in his \nwork. \nApplicant, however, has had alcohol incidents in 2004, 2017, and 2019. He tried \nto distance himself from the first two due to circumstances. Every few years, he has found \nhimself in a similar situation. He states that he can drink and has changed his habits and \nwould not drink and drive. He has made great strides, but the record evidence leaves me \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance at this time.

Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his \n2019 use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on March 12, 2021. \nOn October 15, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse). The DOD acted under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 18, 2021, and requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing.

He received the FORM on January 25, 2022, and filed a timely \nresponse. The DOHA transmittal letter and receipt are appended to the record as \nAdministrative Exhibit (Admin. Ex.) 1. The case was assigned to me on March 17, 2022. \nProcedural Issue \nThe SOR contains a single allegation in which the timeframe of November to \nDecember 2020 is used as a timeframe in which Applicant used marijuana. In his answer \nto the SOR and subsequently in his response to the FORM, Applicant objects to the \naccuracy of the stated timeframe, and states that his marijuana use occurred between \nNovember and December 2019. The record evidence supports Applicant\u2019s 2019 \ntimeframe. \nAlthough the dates in the SOR were erroneous, Applicant structured his answer to \nthe SOR and his response to the FORM using the November to December 2019 \ntimeframe. An SOR is an example of notice pleading and, \u201cSo long as and SOR places \nan applicant on notice of the matters to be addressed in the DOHA proceeding, it satisfies \nthe requirements of the directive.\u201d See, e.g., ISC are Case No. 14-05127 at 6 (App. Bd. \nJun 24, 2016.) Applicant was on notice about the Government\u2019s concerns, and responded \naccordingly. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about November 2020 until about December 2020, while granted access \nto classified information. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted using marijuana \nbetween November 2019 and December 2019, not in 2020. He further stated that he was \nnot working in a cleared position and was not aware that he had an active security \nclearance. These issues will be more fully discussed below. \nApplicant, 31, is a legislative analyst employed by a defense contractor since \nMarch 2021. He served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from July 2012 \nthrough July 2016. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019 and his master\u2019s degree in \n2020. He is currently pursuing a graduate level certificate in legislative studies with an \nanticipated graduation date of August 2023. He was granted his first security clearance \nwhile on active duty in the military. He was re-investigated for a security clearance in \napproximately 2017/2018 while working for a Federal-contractor marketing agency. (GX \n3; GX 4; Answer.) \nOn his March 2021 e-QIP, in response to Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug \nActivity, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to having used illegal drugs in the past seven years. \nHe listed his dates of use as November 2019 to December 2019, explaining \u201cin late \n2019/2020 I smoked weed. This renewed the fact that drugs are not for me.\u201d He further \n2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nstated, \u201cI tried it once or twice and have not touched the drug since with no plans to.\u201d In \nproviding an explanation for why he does or does not intend any future use, Applicant \nstated, \u201cI don\u2019t like it. It was legal in the area I was in and even then I just do not like \nsmoking. To be quite honest, the smell of smoke in general is what ruins it for me.\u201d (GX \n3.) \nThe summary of Applicant\u2019s May 2021 personal subject interview (PSI) was \nsubmitted with the FORM as GX 4, to which Applicant did not object. In the PSI, Applicant \nstated that between November and December 2019, \u201che smoked THC/marijuana twice \nwith friends when they were at a local pub. [Applicant] stated he took 1-2 puffs of one joint \nthe two times he smoked.\u201d He further stated that he did not continue smoking marijuana \nbecause \u201cit was not for him and he really did not enjoy it.\u201d He also stated that he had no \nfuture intention of marijuana use. (GX 4.) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated, \u201cI admit to a single infraction of \nGuideline H.\u201d He further explained: \nThe date of the infraction was between November and December 2019, \nduring my time\u2026 working on my master\u2019s degree\u2026. I did not have access \nto classified information when the infraction took place When the infraction \nhappened, I was in an area that had decriminalized the federally banned \nsubstance and an opportunity presented itself to try this substance to which \nI obliged. After this, I made the decision to not continue usage. . . . this \naction is not reflective of my character . . . I hope the Administrative Judge \nlooks upon this as an honest mistake and not a character defining moment. \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant\u2019s attorney stated that Applicant: \nis an accomplished, intelligent person, but he is not an attorney, much less \na government attorney with a focus on personnel security or the nuanced \ndifferences between decriminalized marijuana use and local jurisdictions \nand federal policy continue to prohibit it. . . . when he believed he was not \nin violation of any rule, he accepted marijuana from an acquaintance when \nit was offered, experimentally. The drug use did not continue; it occurred \nonly once or twice. \nBased on the entirety of the record, I find that the dates of Applicant\u2019s marijuana \nusage set forth in the SOR allegation are erroneous. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred \nbetween November and December 2019.   \nThe only record evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s security clearance history was \nprovided by Applicant. On his e-QIP, he listed that he was granted a secret clearance by \nthe Air Force while on active duty, but was not able to provide a date that the investigation \nwas completed or when the clearance was granted. He also listed an investigation \nperformed by the Department of the Navy which was completed in December 2017.

He listed his dates of employment with \nthis Federal contractor as December 2017 to December 2018. \nIn his answer to the SOR, while asserting that he \u201cdid not have access to classified \ninformation when the infraction took place,\u201d Applicant stated: \nThe current FSO Security Portal that I have access to states that DoDCAF \ngranted my SECRET clearance in April 2019 to which I was sadly unaware. \nTo my knowledge, upon my separation from the Military in 2016, my \nclearance was only sponsored temporarily by OPM during 2018 while I was \nemployed for a Navy recruiting contract in Nashville, Tennessee. Outside \nof this timeframe, I was to believe that my clearance was listed as inactive \nor unsponsored. I did not have direct or indirect access to classified \ninformation for the years of 2018-2021. My access to information was \nrenewed upon my employment in March 2021 which promoted this \ninvestigation. \nIn the FORM, the Government argues that Applicant was on notice, as a result of \nundergoing the security clearance process, that using illegal drugs while possessing a \nsecurity clearance would raise a security concern. The Government goes on to argue \nthat: \nDespite this, he knowingly and intentionally chose to use illegal drugs. His \ndecision to use illegal drugs (while possessing a security clearance), raises \nquestions regarding Applicant\u2019s decision-making, reliability and willingness \nto comply with laws and regulations that are paramount in protecting \nclassified information. \nIn the Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, Applicant\u2019s attorney disputes the \nstatement that Applicant knowingly and intentionally used illegal drugs while holding a \nsecurity clearance on two grounds. First, Applicant did not know he held a security \nclearance at the time and did not have access to classified information. Second, Applicant \nused marijuana in a jurisdiction where it was decriminalized and at the time of usage \nbelieved it to be legal. \nAccording to https://www.nysenate.gov, on July 29, 2019, the Governor of New \nYork signed into law the decriminalization of marijuana. The law decriminalized \npossession of small amounts of marijuana by removing criminal penalties for unlawful \npossession and by reducing the penalty to a violation punishable by a fine. On March 31, \n2021, the Governor of New York signed into law the legalization of recreational marijuana \nfor adults age 21 and older, permitting the use, smoking, ingesting, or other consumption \nof cannabis products and possession of up to 3 ounces or 24 grams of concentrated \ncannabis. \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM also cites the December 21, 2021, \nMemorandum for Distribution from the Director of National Intelligence, Avril D. Haines \n4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(the Haines Memorandum) which provides clarifying guidance concerning marijuana for \nagencies involved in conducting security clearance and positions of trust adjudications. \nSpecifically, the Haines Memorandum states, \u201cBased on current federal law, I provide \nadditional adjudicative guidance herein on three topics that have generated ongoing \ninquiries from federal agencies: 1) recency of recreational marijuana use\u2026.\u201d \nThe memorandum states, \u201cwith regard to the first topic, agencies are instructed \nthat prior recreational marijuana use by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but \nnot determinative.\u201d It then sets forth the factors to be considered when evaluating a \nperson\u2019s security worthiness under the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The memorandum \nfurther states that: \nrelevant mitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and \nwhether the individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, \nincluding by signing an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. (AX G.) \nI have considered the Haines Memorandum and Applicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s arguments based \non her interpretations of the applicability of it to Applicant\u2019s case. \nApplicant stated in his response to the form that he voluntarily disclosed his \nmarijuana use to the Government despite \u201cthere being no legal ramifications or record of \nit.\u201d He provided the results of two negative drug tests dated July 15, 2020, and January \n27, 2022. (AX F.) He also provided a statement of intent not to use any illegal controlled \nsubstance in the future and stipulated to his willingness to undergo random drug testing \nand to have his security clearance immediately revoked in the event of any future positive \ndrug test. (AX H.) Applicant stated in his response to the FORM that he regrets his \nmarijuana use and no longer associates with the acquaintance with whom he smoked \nmarijuana in 2019.  \nApplicant\u2019s three character references, a friend and former roommate who has \nknown Applicant for nine years, a\n  friend of nine years with whom Applicant served in the \nAir Force and lived in the same dormitory, and another friend of seven years with whom \nApplicant also served in the Air Force, were aware of the issues raised in the SOR. \nCollectively, they find Applicant to be reliable and trustworthy with a strong work ethic, \nand unequivocally recommend him for a security clearance.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

In \nhis response to the FORM, Applicant\u2019s position as to why the Government should not be \nconcerned about his marijuana use is fourfold. First, it was in 2019, more than two years \nago. Second, it was only once or twice. Third, although he did in fact have a security \nclearance, he was unaware of it. And, finally, it was \u201clegal\u201d in the jurisdiction where he \nsmoked.  \nBy November 2019, Applicant was a 29-year-old graduate student who had served \non active duty in the Air Force and had undergone two background investigations for \nsecurity clearances. In completing his e-QIPs, he answered multiple questions regarding \nillegal drug use, to include marijuana. He was put on notice that the Government is \nconcerned about any illegal drug use. There are no bright line rules for determining when \nconduct is recent. The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality \nof the evidence. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). Given Applicant\u2019s \nage, education, and knowledge of the security clearance process, his marijuana use in \nlate 2019 was recent. \nOn his March 2021 e-QIP, Applicant listed his marijuana use as one or two times \nin late 2019/2020. During his May 2021 PSI, Applicant told the investigator that he smoked \nmarijuana twice with friends between November and December 2019 and that on each of \nthe two times that he smoked marijuana, he took 1 to 2 puffs of a joint. In his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant admits to \u201ca single infraction of Guideline H.\u201d He also referred to his \nmarijuana use as \u201cthe infraction\u201d two times, as \u201cthis action\u201d and as \u201can honest mistake and \nnot a character defining moment.\u201d However, in his response to the FORM, Applicant \nadmits that he used marijuana one or two times. He also stated that he no longer \nassociated with the \u201cacquaintance\u201d with whom he had used marijuana. From a frequency \nof use perspective, there is no discernable difference between one or two times and \nApplicant\u2019s use was infrequent, however Applicant was not consistent with the number of \ntimes he used, a detail that should be clear if it occurred one time, thus raising concerns \nabout his truthfulness. From a credibility perspective, the inconsistency of Applicant\u2019s \nstatements regarding his recent use of marijuana raises concerns about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nApplicant held a security clearance at the time of his marijuana use. Illegal drug \nuse while holding a security clearance raises a significant security concern about a \nperson\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment as well as his or her willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. Applicant has consistently stated that he was not \naware that he held a clearance at the time of his marijuana use and was not working in a \nposition where he had access to classified or sensitive information. On its face, a strict \napplication of disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 25(f) to a person who was unaware that he or \nshe held a clearance would not promote the basic purposes of the industrial security \nprogram of fairness and due process. \u201cMoreover, provisions of the directive should not \nbe interpreted and construed in a manner that will result in anomalous or absurd results.\u201d \nSee ISCR Case No. 99-0452 (March 21, 2000) at pp. 5-6. \n8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, Appellant had been through two background investigations, and \nestimated his most recent investigation as occurring in December 2017 to work in a \ncleared position for the Navy. He was on notice about the Government\u2019s concerns about \nmarijuana use and knew or should have known that marijuana use remained illegal under \nFederal law. His uses of marijuana in late 2019 reflect a lack of good judgment that \ncontinues to raise concerns about Applicant\u2019s security worthiness. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that \u201cwhen the infraction happened, I \nwas in an area that had decriminalized the federally banned substance and an opportunity \npresented itself to try this substance to which I obliged.\u201d In Applicant\u2019s response to the \nFORM, it is noted that Applicant, while intelligent, is not an attorney, and specifically not a \nGovernment attorney \u201cwith a focus on personnel security or the nuanced differences \nbetween decriminalized marijuana use in local jurisdictions and federal policy continuing \nto prohibit it.\u201d Applicant is a legislative analyst with a master\u2019s degree who is currently \npursuing a post-graduate certificate in legislative studies. While Applicant may not have \nrecognized the distinction between \u201cdecriminalized\u201d and \u201clegal,\u201d he knew or should have \nknown that marijuana use remains illegal under Federal law. \nMitigating Condition AG \u00b6 26(b) requires Applicant to acknowledge his drug use. \nWhile Applicant does admit that he used marijuana in 2019, and claims to regret it, he \ncontinues to minimize the significance of his marijuana use, change his story about the \nnumber of times that he used marijuana and with whom, and justify his illegal conduct by \nsaying that he believed his usage to be legal. This overall failure to accept responsibility \nfor his conduct negates any mitigating impact and AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he no longer associates with \nthe acquaintance with whom he used marijuana one or two times. However, in his PSI, \nApplicant stated that he used marijuana twice with friends. The inconsistencies in his \nstatements make it impossible for me to conclude that Applicant no longer associates \nwith the people with whom he used marijuana. AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) does not apply. \nWhile Applicant has stated that he has no intention of any future use of marijuana \nand has signed a sworn statement to that effect, the application of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) \nnecessarily requires me to rely on Applicant\u2019s credibility. However, based on the record as \na whole, I do not find him to be credible. \nIn considering the totality of the evidence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s recent \nmarijuana use, combined with his inconsistent statements regarding his use, casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant has not met his \nburden of persuasion and has not mitigated the Guideline H concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nThe Haines Memorandum addresses the significance of a person\u2019s recreational \nmarijuana use prior to the initiation of the security clearance vetting process, stating that \nsuch use may be relevant to a security clearance adjudication but not determinative. It \nreiterates the application of a whole-person analysis, highlighting consideration of the \nfrequency of use and whether the individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely. \nThe Haines Memorandum also emphasizes that marijuana use is still a violation of Federal \nlaw and illegal drug use, including marijuana, while holding a security clearance remains \nprohibited. \nAs a DOHA Administrative Judge, I necessarily consider the applicability of the \nwhole-person factors in every decision that I issue. In this case, the clarifications in the \nHaines Memorandum do not have an impact on the final determination. First, the Haines \nMemorandum discusses the security significance of a person\u2019s recreational marijuana use \nprior to submitting a security clearance application. An example of this would be a person\u2019s \nrecreational marijuana use while in college. Clearly, the frequency of use and whether or \nnot that person intended to use marijuana in the future would be significant factors in \nmaking a security worthiness determination. Here, Applicant previously held a security \nclearance while on active duty in the Air Force, and in fact, he held one at the time of his \nmarijuana use in 2019. \nApplicant was 29 years old at the time of the marijuana use and well educated. He \nknew or should have known that his marijuana use was in violation of Federal law, \nregardless of the state\u2019s law. While the two times that Applicant used marijuana constitute \ninfrequent use, the conduct occurred recently. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements \nregarding his marijuana usage and his ongoing minimization of the security significance of \nhis conduct leave me with doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAdditionally, Applicant pointed out in his response to the FORM that he voluntarily \ndisclosed his marijuana use to the Government, despite there being no record of it. The \nsecurity clearance process, beginning with the certification on the security clearance \napplication\u2019s signature block, requires applicants to be completely forthcoming with all \ninformation requested from them by the Government. Failure to voluntarily provide \naccurate information can have dire consequences, to include denial or revocation of a \nperson\u2019s security clearance, prosecution, and removal from Federal service. Applicant is \nnot credited for volunteering derogatory information about himself, as required. \n10\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has \nnot carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He found the pressure of home life and peer pressure led him down the wrong \npath. He stated that in 2018, his life changed and he did not want to continue down that \npath. He enrolled in a technical program that instilled a new focus and gave him positive \ngoals for his life. He participated in an IT internship program. He obtained a technical \ncertification, was hired for a permanent job when he completed his internship, and most \nimportantly he now is responsible for his family and being a positive and strong role model \nfor his daughter. (Items 2, 4) He further stated: \nI understand that I did not make wise choices as a youth and fully admit that \nI was not responsible and made decisions that will negatively impact me for \nthe rest of my life.

(Item \n2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used multiple illegal drugs from 2008 to 2018. He also used legal drugs \nthat were not prescribed to him. He received a citation in 2013 for possession of \nmarijuana. He grew marijuana one time over three months. He purchased and sold \nmarijuana to his friends. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n(c) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used. \nApplicant has an extensive history of illegal drug involvement, including use, \npurchase, sale, and growing marijuana. He also used a myriad of other illegal drugs and \nmisused legal drugs without a prescription. Although all of his actions were illegal, he has \nonly one minor citation for marijuana possession. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s background of growing up in a difficult environment \nand having to help his mother raise his siblings after his stepfather committed suicide. \nThis tragedy affected him and changed the trajectory of his childhood. He watched his \nmother attempt to provide for her children as a single parent. He openly admitted his \ninability to see a positive future and how the pressures of his home life and environment \nled him down the wrong path. He decided to change his life in 2018. He participated in an \nIT internship program. This opportunity offered him a chance to change the course of his \nlife. He did not squander it, but embraced it. After he completed his internship, he was \nhired as a permanent employee. He has been employed more than four years. He is \nengaged and has a two-year-old child. He is focused on providing her a good life in a safe \nenvironment. \nApplicant has not used illegal drugs since May 2018, more than four years ago. \nHe began using them when he was young and has matured into a productive adult. He \ndoes not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He self-disclosed all of his illegal drug \ninvolvement. He still associates with one friend with whom he formerly used drugs, but \nthey do not engage in illegal drug use. He has disassociated from the others. He \ncompleted a training program, was hired full-time, became engaged, and is caring for his \nyoung child. I believe Applicant is committed to leading a drug-free life, and he will not \nuse illegal drugs in the future. I believe he worked hard to move his life in the right direction \nand leave behind his past. I do not think he will jeopardize all that he has worked for by \nusing drugs again. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b) and 26(c) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has changed the course of his life and is a productive member of society. \nI have considered his extensive illegal drug use. I have also considered the environment \nand circumstances of his early life. I have considered where his life was and where it is \nnow. I do not believe he will use illegal drugs in the future. Applicant has met his burden \nof persuasion. The record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 29-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to classified information for his job as a senior software engineer for a company in the defense industry. He has worked as a software engineer since 2015. His educational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in 2015. He has not married and has no children. The SOR alleges a history of excessive alcohol consumption. The allegations appear to be based on information Applicant self-reported in his security clearance application and during his background investigation. (Exhibits 3 and 4) The information he provided during his 2021 background investigation is most informative and is summarized below. Applicant reported during the background investigation that he had a couple of drinks while a high-school student, but mainly began using alcohol at about age 21. He typically would have six drinks per occasion every couple of weeks. In about June 2014 his cousin passed away due to muscular dystrophy. The death hit Applicant hard. As a result, he increased his consumption to six beers or liquor drinks daily to the point where he became intoxicated. He continued at that level until about two or three years ago. Since then to present he drinks about ten beers or liquor drinks daily to the point of intoxication. He drinks at home alone. He stated that his use of alcohol has progressed to the point of addiction and habit. He has no intention to decrease or modify his drinking or to obtai",

It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation. The FORM was received by Applicant on February 11, 2022. He did not \nsubmit a written response to the FORM within the allotted time. The case was assigned \nto me on March 22, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information for his job as a senior software engineer for a company in the \ndefense industry. He has worked as a software engineer since 2015. His educational \nbackground includes a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in 2015. He has not married and has \nno children. \nThe SOR alleges a history of excessive alcohol consumption. The allegations \nappear to be based on information Applicant self-reported in his security clearance \napplication and during his background investigation. (Exhibits 3 and 4) The information \nhe provided during his 2021 background investigation is most informative and is \nsummarized below. \nApplicant reported during the background investigation that he had a couple of \ndrinks while a high-school student, but mainly began using alcohol at about age 21. He \ntypically would have six drinks per occasion every couple of weeks. In about June 2014 \nhis cousin passed away due to muscular dystrophy. The death hit Applicant hard. As a \nresult, he increased his consumption to six beers or liquor drinks daily to the point \nwhere he became intoxicated. He continued at that level until about two or three years \nago. Since then to present he drinks about ten beers or liquor drinks daily to the point of \nintoxication. He drinks at home alone. He stated that his use of alcohol has progressed \nto the point of addiction and habit. He has no intention to decrease or modify his \ndrinking or to obtain treatment in the future. He stated that he previously sought \ntreatment during 2016-2017 per the advice of his family. He stated that he received a \ndiagnosis of alcohol dependency. He stopped attending the treatment when his \ntherapist or counselor left the organization. He also attended a meeting of Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) in January 2019 but did not return for additional meetings. He does \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \nnot believe his use of alcohol has impacted his ability to perform at work, but mentioned \nthat it has made him more anti-social. \nTurning next to the matters in the SOR, the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a is that \nApplicant has consumed alcohol, at time in excess and to the point of intoxication, since \nabout June 2014 to at least May 2020. The allegation is established by the information \nApplicant self-reported in his SF 86 and during his background investigation. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b is that Applicant consumes alcohol to the point of \nintoxication daily. The allegation is established by the information Applicant self-\nreported in his SF 86 and during his background investigation. In particular, he reported \nduring the background investigation that he drinks about ten beers or liquor drinks daily \nto the point of intoxication. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c is that Applicant received \u201ctreatment\u201d at a specific \n\u201cAA\u201d [city, state], from about January 2019 to about January 2019. This allegation is \nmisplaced because it is based on a misreading or misunderstanding of his attendance \nat a single AA meeting in January 2019. Attendance at a single AA meeting, which is a \nform of self-help and peer support group, does not constitute treatment. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d is that Applicant received alcohol treatment from \nabout September 2016 to about February 2017, and received a diagnosis of alcohol \ndependence. This allegation is established by the information Applicant self-reported in \nhis SF 86 and during his background investigation. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e is that Applicant has continued to consume alcohol \nnotwithstanding the diagnosis of alcohol dependence mentioned above. This allegation \nis established by the information Applicant self-reported in his SF 86 and during his \nbackground investigation. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline G for alcohol consumption, the suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt because, as set forth in AG \u00b6 21, \u201cexcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and it can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \ncondition as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a lengthy history of \nexcessive consumption of alcohol that is sufficient to raise a security concern under \nGuideline G. The disqualifying condition noted above applies here. Note, I did not apply \nthe disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 22(d) and AG \u00b6 22(f), as argued by Department \nCounsel, because the evidence is not sufficient to establish the qualifications of the \nperson who made the diagnosis. (Exhibits 3 and 4) I also considered all the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 23, and conclude none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n2  484 U.S. at 531. \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Applicant habitually drinks to excess. Whether \nit\u2019s called binge drinking, heavy drinking, etc., he is drinking excessively by any \nreasonable measure. This conclusion is established by the frequency (daily) and \namount (ten beers or drinks) of alcohol he consumes. Even more worrisome is that he \ndoes not appear to be interested or motivated to abstain from or modify his use of \nalcohol. \nApplicant stated that his initial trigger for increased use of alcohol goes back to \nJune 2014, when a cousin passed away due to muscular dystrophy. I certainly have \nempathy for Applicant. I had a great friend during childhood who was inflicted with \nmuscular dystrophy. I served as a pallbearer for his funeral. My friend\u2019s passing at \nabout age 19 was tough to take. But I came realize that my friend would have wanted \nme to get on with things and live my life. My hope here is that Applicant\u2014who is still a \nyoung man at age 29\u2014comes to realize there is a better way to live his life. Likewise, I \nstrongly encourage Applicant to obtain qualified professional help. Given his excessive \ndrinking and past diagnosis of alcohol dependence, it is highly likely Applicant would \nbenefit from a rigorous alcohol-treatment program, such as inpatient treatment followed \nby appropriate aftercare. But until he does so and can show substantial evidence of \nreform and rehabilitation, he will continue to be an unsuitable candidate for eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Applicant stated that he has made two payments of $300 toward this debt. \nHe has provided documentation that supports these payments. He does not know how \nmuch he still owes, but he intends to continue his payments until the debt is paid in full. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \n1.e. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $541 for an account that \nwas placed for collection. This was a credit card that Applicant opened. Applicant \nstates that he has paid off the debt, and has provided documentation to show that the \naccount has been settled in full and resolved.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, and Tr. p. 36.) \n1.f. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $700 for an account that \nwas charged off. This was a credit card that Applicant opened. Applicant states that he \npaid off the debt, but he cannot find the receipt to verify his payment. The debt remains \nowing. \n1.g. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $555 for an account that \nwas charged off. This was a credit card that Applicant opened. Applicant states that he \npaid off the debt, but he cannot find the receipt to verify his payment. The debt remains \nowing. \nApplicant testified that he earns about $2,600 a month. He also receives VA \ndisability which is about $1,700 monthly, totaling approximately $4,500 monthly that he \nhas to live on. Applicant stated that he plans to start paying his delinquent debts next \nmonth. In addition to half of the rent, Applicant\u2019s regular monthly expenses include \n$300 in utilities, $800 for his car payment, and $100 for his cell phone.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has chosen to provide his family with financial assistance and has been \nunable to pay his own debts. He has a history of financial hardship. His actions or \ninactions both demonstrated a history of not addressing his debt and an inability to do \nso. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has incurred delinquent debt that he could not afford to pay because \nhis priorities have been directed at helping his family, including his immediate and \nextended family members. \nHe has recently directed his focus at resolving his \ndelinquent debts. \nHowever, he is just starting the process. \nApplicant\u2019s financial \nirresponsibility and inaction for so long casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant needs more time to show the Government \nthat he will continue to properly resolve his financial delinquencies with regular \nsystematic payments and consistency. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts have been resolved. Overall, Applicant shows little progress towards resolving \nhis debts. He still owes a significant amount of money to his creditors that he obviously \ncannot afford to pay or has simply ignored. There is insufficient evidence in the record \nto show that the Applicant has carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the \ngovernment security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant follows through with his commitment to show financial responsibility, \nsometime in the future he may be found to be sufficiently reliable to properly protect and \naccess classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.c.   \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d. and 1.e. \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

About one month before Applicant signed his \ne-QIP, he obtained a medical marijuana card from a physician in his state of residence \nand work. (Item 3 at 28; Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 4 and 8; Item 6 at 2.) \n1.b. Applicant continued to use marijuana after he signed his e-QIP on October 30, \n2020, and that use has continued up until at least the date of the Reply. (Item 4 at 2; Item \n5 at 3-4, 8.) \n1.c. In his e-QIP Applicant responded affirmatively to a question about his intention \nto use marijuana in the future. He noted further: \u201cI would strongly prefer this method of \npain relief [using marijuana] over Narcotics.\u201d He concluded stating: \u201cif this [his use of \nmedical marijuana with a state medical marijuana card] is problematic, please let me \nknow\u201d. He was reported as stating during his background interview that he would like to \ncontinue to use marijuana for his back pain, but he would cease using it immediately if \nhis use of marijuana was an issue with his employer or his security clearance. In his \nresponse to interrogatories, he wrote that he intends to continue his daily use of marijuana \n\u201cif acceptable\u201d and was \u201cwilling to cease as necessary.\u201d In his Reply, Applicant wrote: I \nwould like to reiterate that I have repeatedly stated I would be willing to cease medical \ncannabis use at the department\u2019s request, to secure a security clearance. This is not my \npreference because that may make prescription opiates necessary in the evening.\u201d (Item \n3 at 28; Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 4; Reply.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n     \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant has used marijuana with varying frequency since June 2013 to at least \nthe date of the Reply. He wishes to continue in the future unless the Defense Department \n\u201crequests\u201d that he stop. He has failed to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue \nhis substance misuse. These facts establish the three SOR allegations and provide prima \nfacie support for the application of the foregoing disqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the \nburden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns. \nAG \u00b6 26 includes two conditions in that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nThe record evidence does not establish either of the above mitigating conditions. \nApplicant seeks to attribute his most recent drug use to a need for the medical benefits \nhe believes his marijuana provides him. He has not submitted any information to show \nthat he is attempting to pursue an alternative pain management therapy. His statement \nthat his only alternative to marijuana is narcotics or opiates is na\u00efve and reveals his lack \nof efforts to seek professional medical advice about pain management. Due to the serious \nrisk of addiction to either narcotics or opiates, they are not available for long-term pain \nmanagement. Applicant\u2019s current use of marijuana casts doubts on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s statement in his Reply that he would \u201ccease medical cannabis use at \nthe department\u2019s request, to secure a security clearance\u201d reverses the order of the steps \nnecessary to establish mitigation of his past drug use. He needs to provide evidence of \nactions taken to change his past illegal behavior, establish a track record of abstinence, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nand provide a written statement that he intends to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse with the acknowledgment that any future involvement or misuse would \nbe grounds for the revocation of his national security eligibility. Applicant has not \nestablished mitigation of the security concerns raised by his historical use of marijuana \nand his current daily use of marijuana. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Further comments are \nwarranted. Applicant\u2019s history of drug use spans a number of years and continues up until \nthe present. I have considered Applicant\u2019s age in the context of his experimental use of \nmarijuana while in college. I have also considered his claim that his use of marijuana at \nthe present time is for medical purposes. I am not persuaded by his argument that he has \nno practical alternative pain management strategy. I have taken into consideration \nApplicant\u2019s position that he should be deemed trustworthy because of the honesty he has \nshown by being transparent about his drug use during the security clearance process \nwhile others have lied about their drug involvement. His current use of a drug he knows \nto be illegal under Federal law, however, undercuts his claim of being trustworthy enough \nto hold a Federal security clearance and comply with Federal information security \nprocedures. Most significantly, Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised by his use \nof marijuana by providing evidence of \u201cpermanent behavioral changes\u201d with respect to his \nuse of marijuana. Overall, the record evidence creates questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance at the present \ntime. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 42, has never been married. He has two children, ages 7 and 16. He received his high school diploma in 1998. He attended an online university from 2009 through 2011, without earning a degree. He has been employed as an advanced manufacturing technician since December 2018 by a defense contractor, with whom he had been previously employed on a contract basis through another company beginning in May 2018. He was unemployed from March 2018 through May 2018, after leaving a previous employer to relocate from State A to State B. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Item 3) The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his federal and state tax income tax returns for tax years 2018 and 2019. It also alleged 10 delinquent debts totaling $23,975, including six student-loan accounts totaling $6,950, an $11,194 child-support account, two utility accounts totaling $1,940, and unpaid federal taxes totaling $3,891 for tax years 2018 and 2019. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all but one of the SOR debts. He denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d (a $126 utility account) on the basis that that it had been paid.

Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise an objection to Item 4 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond \nto the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item \n4 could be considered as evidence in his case. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 42, has never been married. He has two children, ages 7 and 16. \nHe received his high school diploma in 1998. He attended an online university from 2009 \nthrough 2011, without earning a degree. He has been employed as an advanced \nmanufacturing technician since December 2018 by a defense contractor, with whom he \nhad been previously employed on a contract basis through another company beginning \nin May 2018. He was unemployed from March 2018 through May 2018, after leaving a \nprevious employer to relocate from State A to State B. This is his first application for a \nsecurity clearance. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his federal and state tax income tax \nreturns for tax years 2018 and 2019. It also alleged 10 delinquent debts totaling $23,975, \nincluding six student-loan accounts totaling $6,950, an $11,194 child-support account, \ntwo utility accounts totaling $1,940, and unpaid federal taxes totaling $3,891 for tax years \n2018 and 2019. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all but one of the SOR debts. He denied \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d (a $126 utility account) on the basis that that it had been \npaid. Each alleged debt was confirmed by a December 2020 credit report. (Items 2, 5) \nApplicant failed to file, as required, his federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2018 and 2019, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k. He also failed to pay federal \nincome taxes for tax years 2018 and 2019, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. He attributed his \nfailure to file to a combination of procrastination, laziness, and pandemic-related \nchallenges in accessing his tax preparer. In his November 2020 SCA, Applicant proffered \nplans to file his 2018 returns with his 2019 returns. During his January 2021 security \nclearance interview (SCI), he proffered plans to file his 2018 through 2020 returns in \nFebruary 2021. He asserted that there was zero chance that he would file late again. He \nalso formulated the following plan to ensure that he would file timely going forward: 1) he \nwill make a standing appointment with his tax preparer for each filing season; and 2) he \nwill file his returns as soon as he receives his W-2 form.

However, his IRS tax account transcripts revealed that he filed his 2018 \nthrough 2020 federal returns in May 2021. His entire 2020 federal refund ($2,215) was \napplied to his child-support debt. As of June 28, 2021, he owed the IRS taxes in the \namount of $3,764 and $127, respectively, for tax years 2018 and 2019, as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.l. In his Answer, Applicant averred that he was in the process of \u201cfiling for a repayment \nplan\u201d to resolve his 2018 and 2019 federal tax debt. (Item 2; Item 5 at 13-17) \nApplicant filed his 2020 state tax return sometime in or before May 2021, the exact \ndate of which is not specified in the record. State B used his entire state tax refund of \n$1,153 for tax year 2020 in May 2021 to pay outstanding tax and child-support liabilities. \n$493 of the refund was applied towards his child-support debt, and the remainder was \nlisted as an \u201cinternal offset,\u201d with $0 of the refund being received by Applicant. There are \nno documents in the record to corroborate that Applicant\u2019s 2018 and 2019 state returns \nhave been filed. (Item 5 at 14) \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f through 1.i are student-loan accounts \nassociated with the online university that Applicant attended from March 2009 until \nJanuary 2011, when he stopped to focus on work and to keep food on the table. He \nacknowledged that he had not made payments on the loans since 2011. A December \n2020 credit report reported two of the debts totaling $2,907 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c), as \nplaced for collection in May 2011 by the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE); and the \nremaining four debts totaling $4,043 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.i), as 120 days or more past \ndue by Navient (two were opened in July 2009, and two in March 2010). (Item 2; Item 4 \nat 2, 4-5: Item 5; Item 6 at 18) \nThe record did not indicate whether the Navient loans are federal or private. \nHowever, Applicant claimed that Navient serviced all six loans, without providing any \ncorroborating documentation. He maintained that, despite his efforts, he has been unable \nto reach the USDOE to confirm whether the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c are, in \nfact, being serviced by Navient. The Navient loans were in forbearance from March 2021 \nuntil February 2022, which he stated he applied for because he had children and had a \nhard time making ends meet. In his Answer, he asserted that he was \u201cawaiting payment \ninfo after forbearance expired\u201d on the Navient loans, and that the U.S. Department of \nEducation \u201ccould not be reached to inquire about details\u201d of those loans.

Applicant opened the account approximately 14 years ago for two phones, \none for himself and the other for his oldest child. He asserted that he was current with the \naccount for about 11 or 12 years, until he could no longer afford the monthly payment. He \nattempted to return the phones to Provider A to resolve the debt. However, Provider A \nwould not accept them due to the terms of his service contract agreement. He then tried \nto resolve the debt by obtaining service with a new provider, with the expectation that he \nwould be given a credit for his two existing phones sufficient to repay the debt. However, \nhe was not given that credit due to the age of the phones. At some point, he received a \nletter from a collection agent for Provider A. He claimed that he could not afford to pay \nthe collection debt. In his SCA, he promised to resolve the debt by the end of November \n2020. During his SCI, he asserted that he planned to negotiate with the collection agent \nin an attempt to settle for a lesser amount. In his Answer, he stated that he had \u201cnot yet \nset up a payment plan.\u201d (Item 2; Item at 38; Item 4 at 4) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is an account placed for collection by Applicant\u2019s \nformer internet-service provider with whom he had service in 2017. Although he asserted \nthat he was not delinquent on his account when he closed the account and returned his \nequipment in 2018, there remained a balance for unpaid fees. In his SCA, he promised \nto resolve the debt by the end of November 2020. During his SCI, he maintained that he \nwas still attempting to contact the creditor to satisfy the debt in full. In his Answer, he \nclaimed that he paid the debt, without proffering any corroborating documentation. In \n(Item 2; Item 3 at 37; Item 4 at 4). \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is the arrearage amount that Applicant owes for his \nyoungest child\u2019s support. He claimed that he had been timely paying $800 per month for \na period between mid to late 2017. Then, he was only paying \u201cwhatever and whenever \nhe could\u201d due to his unemployment for a period of about seven to eight months beginning \nin March 2018, which the state considered a gift rather than child support. On a date not \nindicated in the record, State A garnished his wages in the monthly amount of $1,064, \nincluding $800 for child support and $264 for the arrearage. Once he began working for \nhis current employer in December 2018, State B adjusted his wage garnishment to his \nnew salary, in an amount not indicated in the record, without including any amount for the \narrearage, to which he attributes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. During his SCI, he averred \nthat his various attempts to reach State B to discuss a resolution of his debt were \nunsuccessful. In his Answer, he stated: \u201cIn process of coming to an agreement with other \nparty involved.\u201d A child-support order is not in place for his oldest child because he shares \njoint custody with her mother. (Item 2; Item 3 at 35; Item 4 at 2) \nDuring his SCI, Applicant asserted that he was current with all of his day-to-day \nexpenses. The only credit report in the record, from December 2020, revealed that he \nbrought current an automobile loan account that had been 60 days past due. It also shows \nthat he took out a cash loan in the amount of $1,500 in July 2020, with a payment of $261 \nper month and a balance of $1,201, which was then current. (Item 4 at 5; Item 5 at 6) \nApplicant reported one period of unemployment between March 2018 and May \n2018, during which he received unemployment benefits in the amount of $1,200 to $1,500 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \nbi-weekly.

It also showed that his wages are garnished in the amount of about \n$305 per pay period; and, that he pays about $20 per pay period towards a 401k loan. \nThere was no other information in the record about that loan. The paystub does not \nindicate any details about the garnishment. The record otherwise contains scant details \nsurrounding his income and expense history. The record does not indicate whether \nApplicant sought or received financial counseling. (Item 3 at 15-16; Item 4 at 6) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v.

ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations); and AG \u00b6 19(f) \n(failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant filed his 2018 through 2020 federal returns in May 2021. On a date not \nindicated in the record, he filed his 2020 state return for which he received a refund in \nMay 2021. The extent to which his delayed filing was attributed to procrastination and \nlaziness versus pandemic-related delays was not fully developed by the record. \nNevertheless, I find that pandemic-related delays can reasonably explain the delays with \nrespect to his 2019 and 2020 returns. While it is troublesome that he failed to file his 2018 \nreturns without any justifiable excuse, I find SOR \u00b6 1.j in his favor given that he filed them \nby May 2021, which is within a reasonable period following pandemic-related delays. \nHowever, I am unable to similarly find SOR \u00b6 1.k in his favor given that the status of his \n2018 and 2019 state return filings was not corroborated by sufficient evidence. \nApplicant has not resolved any of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, \nincluding his federal taxes for tax years 2018 and 2019. I am unable to conclude that the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is resolved, as he claimed, without documentary proof. He did \nnot proffer any evidence concerning whether he has made any payments since the \nforbearance period ended on the Navient loans. Although he did not establish that the \nUSDOE loans were being serviced by Navient, they qualify for the emergency relief \nextended through August 2022. Whether his Navient loans qualify for that relief is \nunknown. In any event, the extent to which his USDOE loans and any federal loans held \nby Navient were entitled to the benefit of the emergency relief beginning in March 2020 \ndoes not suffice to mitigate concerns surrounding his nonpayment since 2011. \nApplicant did not establish that his debts largely resulted from, or persisted, due to \ncircumstances beyond his control. He did not demonstrate that his relocation was \ninvoluntary. He did not proffer sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he was unable to \nafford to make his child support, student loans, or any other expenses, including during \nthe period that he received unemployment compensation. His December 2020 credit \nreport does not demonstrate that his finances are under control, and there was no more \nrecent credit report in the record to determine the current state of his finances. \nThe record does not establish that Applicant acted responsibly to address his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindebtedness nor did he demonstrate a track record of responsible action that leads me \nto conclude that he will follow through with his plans to resolve his delinquent debts. I am \nunable to conclude that his indebtedness is not likely to recur and no longer casts doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Thus, I find that Applicant has not \nmitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (d), and (g) are not \nestablished to mitigate the concerns alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i, and 1.l. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n Formal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k \u2013 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant answered the SOR on \nMarch 6, 2022, and elected to have a hearing. (Answer) The case was assigned to me \non June 8, 2022. On June 29, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nnotified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for August 10, 2022. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled via video teleconference on Microsoft Teams. \nI marked the July 18, 2022 case management order as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I; Department \nCounsel\u2019s exhibit list as HE II; and Department Counsel\u2019s June 1, 2022 discovery letter \nas HE III.

These admissions prompted Department Counsel \nto move to amend the SOR, pursuant to Paragraph 17 of the Additional Procedure \nGuidance of the Directive, to add the following allegations: \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. You are indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes \nin the approximate amount of $5,200 for tax year 2019. As of the date of the \nStatement of Reasons, the taxes remain unpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m. You are indebted to State A for delinquent taxes in the\napproximate amount of $900 for tax year 2019. As of the date of the\nStatement of Reasons, the taxes remain unpaid. \n \n \nApplicant did not object to the motion to amend the SOR. I left the record open \nuntil September 7, 2022, to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit documentary \nevidence. See ISCR 02-23365 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2004) (\u201c[A]s long as there is fair \nnotice to an applicant about the matters that are at issue in his case, and the applicant \nhas a reasonable opportunity to respond, a security clearance case should be adjudicated \non the merits of the relevant issues and should not be overly concerned with pleading \nniceties.\u201d); See also ISCR Case No. 05-05334 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2007) (\u201cThe \ngovernment and the Judge are free to amend the SOR at any time, but must permit \nApplicant time and an opportunity to respond to the adverse reason upon which any \nadverse decision is based.\u201d). Applicant did not submit any post-hearing documentation. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is almost 47 years old and has an 18-year-old son. He married in July \n2006 and divorced in April 2011. He received a high school diploma in 1994, and has \nbeen attending college courses since October 2018, studying organizational leadership. \nHe has earned enough credits to be a second semester junior. He enlisted in the U.S. Air \nForce delayed entry program in February 1997, and served on active duty from February \n1998 until 2003, when he was honorably discharged.

He \nthen served on active duty in the Army until January 2017, when he was medically \ndischarged, and eventually received a 100 percent disability rating. His total military \nservice was 18 years.

(GE 1; GE 2; GE 5; Tr. 10, 22-32, 36, 38-39) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his state and federal income tax \nreturns, as required, for TYs 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, and as of the date \nof the SOR, TYs 2014, 2015, 2019, and 2020 remained unfiled. He denied both of these \nallegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c).

During this period, he was supported by unemployment benefits, the \nServicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944 (GI Bill) benefits he received while attending \ncollege courses, and disability benefits. After leaving active duty in 2017, his disability \nrating increased from 60 to 80 percent, and in July 2022, he was awarded 100 percent \ndisability. (GE 2 at 9; Tr. 32-35) \nIn Applicant\u2019s March 2021 SCA, he disclosed that he had not filed his state and \nfederal tax returns for TY 2019 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and he \nanticipated that he owed $1,500. He did not clarify if he owed this amount to one of the \ntax entities or if this was how much he owed collectively. He also disclosed the delinquent \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k. He claimed he was working \nwith a credit specialist to address several of the debts, and they resulted, in part, due to \nlosing his job. (GE 1 at 35-36). \nIn May 2021, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He adopted \nthis statement in his October 2021 response to DOHA interrogatories. His finances were \ndiscussed as well as many of the debts alleged in the SOR. He also admitted he had not \nfiled his state and federal income tax returns for TY 2019, but he indicated his intent to \ndo so in the next 30 days. (GE 2) \nIn October 2021, Applicant completed a second SCA. His financial information \nremained unchanged from his March 2021 SCA. As mentioned above, DOHA sent him \ninterrogatories that he signed on October 5, 2021. He was asked, in part, to provide the \nstatus for his state and federal income tax returns for TY 2013 through 2020. He was also \nasked to provide copies of his IRS account transcripts and documentation from the state \ntax authority for TYs 2013 through 2020. He provided account transcripts from the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) for TYs 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018. He provided no other \ndocumentation. (GE 2; GE 5) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified he filed his federal income tax returns for TYs \n2014 to 2015 in a timely manner using an online tax service he has always used. He failed \nto provide documentation to substantiate this claim in his response to the SOR; in his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories; at the hearing; and after the hearing. He was able to \nprovide evidence that he filed his TY 2016 federal income tax return; therefore, he argued \nhis TYs 2014 and 2015 returns were also filed, because the IRS will not allow a tax payer \nto file a return for a more recent year if an earlier TY remained unfiled. He provided no \nevidence to substantiate this argument. (Answer; GE 2; Tr. 18, 40-48, 51) \nApplicant filed his TY 2017 return late without an extension, but does not have an \noutstanding balance with the IRS or his state tax authority. He filed his TY 2018 state and \nfederal income tax return in a timely manner, but owes the IRS $10,020.

(Tr. 18-19, 44, 48-49, 51-53, 55-56, 59, 81) \nApplicant testified that he had not yet filed his state and federal income tax returns \nfor TY 2019 through 2021. He did not file his federal and state income tax returns for TY \n2019 in a timely manner, because he knew he was going to owe money and it was too \noverwhelming for him at the time to address. He claims the IRS will not allow him to \nestablish an installment agreement until he has filed all his back tax years. His state and \nfederal income tax returns for TY 2021 were not alleged and will not be considered \ndisqualifying; however, I may consider them in determining if mitigation is applicable and \nin my whole-person assessment. He has not sought help from a professional tax \nconsultant, and could not provide a reason why he had failed to do so. (Tr. 18, 44, 48-50, \n53-56, 58-60, 81) \nApplicant has not made any payments toward any of the eight non-tax debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.k. He opened these accounts between May 2016 and \nAugust 2020, and he stopped making payments between January 2020 and August 2021. \nMany of these debts were incurred for him \u201cto basically survive\u201d and to rehabilitate the \nhouse he purchased in December 2016. (GE 1-5; Tr. 61-69) \nShortly before the hearing, Applicant\u2019s disability rating was increased to 100 \npercent ($3,458 monthly), and with this increase, he is able to pay his mortgage and \nutilities. On July 1, 2022, he received an over $8,000 lump-sum payment from the \nVeterans Administration (VA) for back payment related to his disability pay. He did not \nuse this to pay any of the debts alleged in the SOR, instead he \u201cspent it on stuff for the \nhouse.\u201d Nor had he proactively contacted any of the SOR creditors prior to the hearing to \nestablish payment arrangements. He anticipated that once he started his new position he \nwould be able to start to repay some of his delinquent consumer debts. He has $1,500 in \nsavings and no other assets, other than his home. He follows a written budget, and the \nrecord was held open, in part, to allow him to submit a copy, but he chose not do so. He \nhas not sought financial counseling. (Tr. 62, 66, 69-71, 77, 80) \nApplicant did not have any security violations during the period he held a security \nclearance. The record was held open, in part, to allow him to submit documentation \nregarding the awards and decorations he received while serving in the Air Force, Air Force \nReserve, and Army. He did not provide this documentation, but testified that he received \napproximately 21 awards. He deployed to Afghanistan from January 2011 to October \n2011 with Special Forces, and to Kuwait and Iraq from June 2014 to January 2015.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues started due to a period of unemployment between April \n2019 and February 2020; however, he failed to demonstrate that he acted responsibly in \nthe intervening years to address his tax issues and delinquent debts. When he received \nan over $8,000 payment from the VA, shortly before the hearing, he used this money for \nhis home, rather than addressing his delinquent taxes or other debts. \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues are current, ongoing, and recent. He failed to provide \ndocumentation to show that he filed his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2014, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2015, 2019, and 2020. He filed his TY 2017 income tax returns late, and he has admitted \nto not filing his TY 2021 income tax returns, demonstrating that this pattern is continuing \ndespite the government expressing concern regarding his taxes since at least March \n2021. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s history of financial issues, he has not demonstrated he has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances to address and resolve his tax issues and other \nfinancial obligations. Additionally, he provided no proof of payment or resolution for eight \ndelinquent consumer debts. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(g) was not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case, including his lengthy years of military service and deployments. I \nhave incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to provide documentation to establish that he has filed his TYs \n2014, 2015, 2019, and 2020 federal and state income tax returns. He owes over $15,000 \nin federal taxes and $33,000 in consumer debt that he is not addressing. Overall, he has \nnot demonstrated the actions of a responsible, reliable, and trustworthy person. I \nconclude he did not meet his burden of proof and persuasion. He failed to mitigate the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E.

(Tr. 27) In November 2018, the creditor obtained \na default judgment against Applicant for $9,899. (Tr. 25; GE 2) In July 2019, the court \nissued a garnishment order. (GE 2 at 5) From September 2019 to September 2021, his \nmonthly pay was garnished or he made payments at a rate of $400 to $700 monthly. (GE \n2 at 7-8) As of September 13, 2021, he had paid $7,830, and he owed $2,069. (Id.) In \nFebruary 2022, Applicant completed payments to the creditor, and he resolved the debt. \n(Tr. 27; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e allege Applicant has four delinquent debts totaling $2,851 \nas follows: a charged-off bank debt for $234; a charged-off store debt for $612; a jewelry-\nstore debt placed for collection for $1,585; and bank debt placed for collection for $420. \nApplicant said as soon as he saves some money and establishes his budget, he will try \nto pay off these debts. (Tr. 27) He was not in contact with the creditors, and he had not \npaid any of these four debts. (Tr. 27, 37) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.k allege six Department of Education (DoEd) debts totaling \n$18,495 placed for collection as follows: $3,730; $1,848; $534; $7,052; $1,865; and \n$3,465. Applicant attended college from 2012 to November 2016; however, he did not \nreceive a degree. (Tr. 32) When the six-month forbearance ended in 2017, Applicant was \nunemployed and unable to make payments. (Tr. 33) From 2018 to 2020, he had \ninsufficient income to make his monthly student loan payments because of his child \nsupport, rent, and car payment responsibilities, which had a higher priority. (Tr. 33) Some \nof his student loans were discharged because the school he had attended was involved \nin fraudulent activity. (Tr. 20) He said he contacted the creditor; his student loans were \nconsolidated; and in 2019, he paid $35 for 10 months to rehabilitate his loans. (Tr. 20, 30) \nHis new monthly payments after the end of the pandemic forbearance will be $210.

(GE 3 at 2)  \nApplicant\u2019s September 13, 2021 credit bureau report shows a vehicle loan for \n$14,760 and a credit card for $308, and both are in pays as agreed status. (GE 3 at 2-3) \nHe repaid a debt to the Department of Veterans Affairs. (GE 3 at 3) Applicant filed all of \nhis previous federal income tax returns; however, he had not filed his federal income tax \nreturn for tax year (TY) 2021, and he did not request an extension. (Tr. 35) He expects to \nfile his federal income tax return within a couple of weeks after his hearing. (Tr. 38) When \nhe files, he does not believe he will owe any additional taxes. \nApplicant enjoys his job. (Tr. 39) He held a clearance when he was in the Air Force, \nand there is no evidence of a security violation.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd.

The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe relevant financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as \nfollows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \nApplicant paid his largest debt for $9,899 through garnishment. See ISCR Case \nNo. 08-06059 at 6 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2009) (indicating involuntary payment of debts \nthrough garnishment is not necessarily mitigating). In 2019, he consolidated his student \nloans and completed 10 payments to rehabilitate them. All of Applicant\u2019s student-loan \ndebts are in \u201cpays as agreed\u201d status. While complete reliance on the COVID-19 \npandemic-based student loans deferment to establish mitigation for security clearance \npurposes is misplaced, in this instance, Applicant completed the loan rehabilitation before \nthe pandemic forbearance began.

In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the applicant had $41,871 in delinquent credit-card debt and \ndefaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant \nfiled for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at \n1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been \nunemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was \ninconsistent in his child support payments to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG \n\u00b6 20(a) was \u201cclearly applicable (debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment)\u201d even though that applicant\u2019s debts were unresolved \nat the time the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board \nalso decided that the record evidence raised the applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b) because of \nthe absence of evidence of irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of \ntrustworthiness. Id. at 4. I note that Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability \nof any mitigating conditions, and the burden to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the Government. \nSimilarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal Board \naddressed a situation where an applicant was sporadically unemployed and lacked the \nability to pay his creditors. The Appeal Board noted \u201cit will be a long time at best before \nhe has paid\u201d all of his creditors. Id. at 3. The applicant was living on unemployment \ncompensation at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a \ncircumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: \nHowever, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required \nto be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given \nhis [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan. \nISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd.

However, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] \ncontrol, the judge could still consider whether applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); \nISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. His credit reports \nreflect paid debts, debts with a zero balance, or debts in a current paid as agreed status. \nOnly four SOR debts totaling less than $3,000 are currently delinquent. His single late \nfiled tax return is an isolated occurrence which he promised to remedy shortly after his \nhearing. \nApplicant established mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d). He showed \ngood faith in his overall handling of his finances. I found his statement at his hearing to \nbe candid and credible. He promised to pay his debts and maintain his financial \nresponsibility. His delinquent debts are unlikely to recur. There are clear indications his \nfinancial problems are under control. His history of handling his finances does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old communications electronics technician who has been \nemployed by the same contractor for two years. In 2002, he joined the Air Force, and he \nreceived a general discharge under honorable conditions in 2011. His highest rank was \nE-5. His Air Force specialty was communications electronics ground radio. He has never \nbeen married, and he has a daughter who is eight years old. He is current on his monthly \nchild support responsibilities of about $450. \nApplicant was unemployed in 2017 for about four months, and he was homeless. \nFrom 2018 to 2020, his annual salary was about $25,000. In 2020, his annual salary was \nabout $45,000, and his current annual salary is about $51,000. He paid off a delinquent \nvehicle debt for $9,899 through garnishment. His student loans are current. He has \nseveral non-SOR debts in current status. Four SOR debts totaling less than $3,000 need \nto be resolved, and he promised to resolve them as soon as he is able to do so. Now that \nhis garnishment has been completed he has ample additional funds to pay the last four \ndelinquent debts and his student loans when the forbearance ends. \nThe overall record provides persuasive support for continued access to classified \ninformation. His finances were harmed by several circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol as discussed supra. He showed a track record of consistent payments to address \nand rehabilitate his student loans. He understands that he needs to pay his debts, and \nthe conduct required to retain his security clearance. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). Applicant understands what he needs to do to maintain his financial \nresponsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d \nof debt re-payment. Security officials can check his credit reports and initiate revocation \nof his security clearance if he shows a lack of financial responsibility. I am confident he \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwill resume his student-loan payments when the federal deferment ends, and he will \nmaintain his financial responsibility. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

Her conduct will be evaluated under this guideline as \nwell. She did not admit or deny the single allegation under this paragraph, which I view \nas a denial. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \nApplicant used marijuana on an occasionally frequent basis from 2012 to at least \nDecember 2020, or May 2021. She used cocaine, mushrooms, and methamphetamine \non an experimental basis five years ago. The stated disqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s cocaine, mushroom, and methamphetamine use was experimental in \nnature. It ended five years ago and she evinces a credible intent not to use any of those \ndrugs in the future. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a) applies to those allegations. \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d are found for Applicant. \nApplicant used marijuana for about eight years on an occasional basis ending \nsomewhere between December 2020 and May 2021. I am viewing her signed Answer \nand signed Item 4 as equivalent to a signed statement of intent. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021 \n(Guidance). In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana. She reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 \nmemorandum regarding the importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality \nof the use of marijuana by holders of security clearances. She provided further \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclarification of Federal marijuana policy writing that this policy remains relevant to security \nclearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative \nguidelines provided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security \nconcerns raised by his or her past use of marijuana. (Guidance at 1.) \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use ended between December 2020 and May 2021. Using \neither date, it is simply too soon to be sure she will not use marijuana in the future. Viewed \nin the context of the whole person, Applicant has not mitigated the security significance \nof her past drug use within such a recent period of time. \nAllegations 1.e and 1.f are cumulative, since they allege the same conduct over \nthe same period as 1.a. Under the particular circumstances of this case they are found \nfor Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant used marijuana between 2010 and sometime between December 2020 \nand June 2021. The above disqualifying condition has application to the facts of this case. \nThe following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 17 is possibly applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nI have examined Applicant\u2019s conduct in using marijuana until sometime between \nDecember 2020 and June 2021. I have also considered the fact that she used marijuana \nafter being employed by a defense contractor and after filling out her e-QIP. For the \nreasons stated under Guideline H, above, I find Applicant has not mitigated the \nallegations under this paragraph. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated her \ndrug use. Overall, the record evidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance.

He \nis a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. Applicant served on active \nduty in the U.S. Army from May 2014 until August 2017, when he was honorably \ndischarged. Applicant also served in the Army National Guard from August 2019 until his \nhonorable discharge in February 2020. Applicant has been unemployed since July 2020. \nHe is sponsored for employment by a defense contractor pending eligibility for a security \nclearance. (Item 3.) \nThe SOR alleged one delinquent account for $15,182. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted \nthat allegation and produced no documents. (Item 2.) The delinquent account is a loan \nfor an automobile Applicant bought in 2017. Not long after the purchase, he realized that \nhe could not make the monthly payments. Applicant returned the vehicle to the \ndealership, but they charged him $9,000 for the voluntary repossession. He attempted to \nwork out a payment plan with the collection agency but was unsuccessful. (Item 4.) That \nloan account has been charged off and is the only delinquent account on Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial record. All other accounts are in \u201cPays As Agreed\u201d status. Applicant has \nconsidered financial counseling but has not done so yet. (Items 4 and 5.) Applicant did \nnot respond to the FORM, so there is no more recent information available about the \nstatus of the debt, his ability or efforts to pay it, or his current financial status. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

No other debts are evident. The singular nature of the debt suggests that it is \nisolated. AG \u00b6 20(a), therefore, has some application. The debt, however, is also recent \nand ongoing. Therefore, I cannot find that AG \u00b6 20(a) fully applies. In addition, Applicant \nhas not established that he has undertaken any good-faith efforts to address his debt, by \nrepaying the creditor, or otherwise resolving the debt. AG \u00b6 20(d), therefore, does not \napply. I have also considered the other mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. No other \nmitigating conditions apply. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nAs part of my whole-person analysis, it is worth noting that the SOR debt is the \nonly blemish on Applicant\u2019s financial record. His other accounts are current. Applicant\u2019s \neffort to consummate a payment plan with the collection agency was unsuccessful. On \nthis record, Applicant may very well benefit from financial counseling, but there is no \nevidence that he has yet done so. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.a.:                                        \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On February 4, 2022, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nH (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse), G (Alcohol Consumption), and E (Personal \nConduct).

Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on April 25, 2022. The case was assigned to me on April 26, 2022. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on April 28, \n2022. I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 17, 2022. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified \non his own behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through H. Applicant\u2019s exhibits \nwere also admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non July 5, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 29-years-old. He has been employed with a defense contractor since \nSeptember 2021. He is single. Applicant received a Doctorate in August 2021. He is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his work with the Defense \nDepartment. This is his first application for a security clearance. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted all four allegations under this \nparagraph with explanations. \n1.a and 1.d. Applicant used marijuana approximately seven to nine times between \n2015 and October 2020. His usage included smoking marijuana and consuming edibles. \nHe purchased marijuana on a single occasion in 2018. HIs October 2020 marijuana use \noccurred when he visited friends in a state where the purchase and use of marijuana is \nlegal. He further testified that he stopped marijuana use because he really did not like it \nand he wanted to move on with his career. (Tr. 21-27, 42-44, 46; Government Exhibit 1 \nat Section 23; Government Exhibit 2.) \n1.b and 1.c. Applicant purchased and used psilocybin mushrooms on a single \noccasion in about July 2020 with friends. He realizes that the purchase and use of \nmushrooms was illegal. He has no intention of using or purchasing any mushrooms in the \nfuture, admitting that this was an impulsive mistake. He is no longer in touch with the \nperson from whom he obtained the mushrooms. (Tr. 44-45, 54; Government Exhibit 1 at \nSection 23; Government Exhibit 2.) \nApplicant submitted a Statement of Intent. In that Statement he indicated that he \nis not currently using any controlled substances, that he has no future intent to use any \nillegal controlled substances or misuse prescription medication, and he stipulated to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nrandom drug testing and the immediate and unqualified revocation of his security \nclearance in the event of a positive drug test. (Applicant Exhibit G.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he consumes intoxicants to excess. Applicant denied the single allegation under \nthis paragraph. \n2.a. Applicant admitted that he has consumed alcohol, occasionally to intoxication,\nstarting in about March 2018 through December 2021. He testified that he has reduced \nhis drinking \u201csignificantly\u201d because he is too busy with his job and healthy personal \nlifestyle to engage in excessive alcohol consumption. He has had no alcohol-related \narrests or incidents at any time in his past. There is no evidence that he has been \ndiagnosed with an alcohol problem. A current coworker submitted a statement indicating \nthat he has not seen the Applicant drink to the point of intoxication during the time he has \nknown him. (Tr. 27-39, 45-46; Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit D.) \n \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness or \nunreliability. Applicant denied subparagraph 3.a. He admitted the other two allegations. \n3.a. This subparagraph alleged that Applicant socializes with individuals who use \nillegal substances. Applicant testified that he has informed the people he used illegal \nsubstances with earlier that they could not do that in front of him. He believes that these \npeople will support him in this endeavor. Applicant Exhibit F is a statement from a friend \nconcerning Applicant\u2019s decision not to be around people who use illegal substances. (Tr. \n46-49.) \n3.b. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that Applicant\u2019s drug use \nhistory, as set forth under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E. \n3.c. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that Applicant\u2019s alcohol use \nhistory, as set forth under Paragraph 2, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E. \nMitigation \nApplicant received an evaluation from a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist \n(LMFT) who is also an Addiction Treatment Counselor. Her report is dated June 6, 2022, \nand is Applicant Exhibit H. Based on her evaluation of Applicant using various diagnostic \ncriteria she reported, \u201c[Applicant] does not fit any of the criteria; thus no evidence of \nmisuse of drugs or alcohol. He has not experienced any adverse effects or consequences \nconsistent with the misuse of substances.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe therapist further stated, \u201cLastly, my impression of [Applicant] is that he is an \nhonest, reliable, hard-working individual. He also made it clear to me that a career is of \nthe utmost importance to him and he would not do anything to jeopardize such a life-\nchanging opportunity.\u201d \nAs stated, Applicant Exhibit D is a letter from a coworker. The witness writes that \nApplicant is an effective member of the team stating, \u201cHe [Applicant] is honest about his \nwork and someone I can trust to put forth his best work.\u201d \nThe record shows that Applicant had a successful academic career. In addition to \nschool, he also engaged in extra-curricular activities that helped his community. \n(Applicant Exhibits A through C.) \nApplicant testified that he has been very successful in his first year with his \nemployer. He was nominated for and received an award for his hard work. (Tr. 19-21.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on an infrequent basis from 2015 to 2020. He used \npsilocybin mushrooms one time in 2020. He purchased each drug on a single occasion. \nBoth of the stated disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n I have also considered the Memorandum from the Director of National Intelligence \ndated December 21, 2021, entitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance \nConcerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d \n(Applicant Exhibit E.) \nApplicant used marijuana on an infrequent basis between 2015 and 2020. He used \nmushrooms on a single occasion in 2020. He purchased each drug on a single occasion. \nApplicant stated in his Answer that he intended to abstain from future drug use. He \nconfirmed this statement during his testimony. He submitted a signed statement of intent. \n(Applicant Exhibit G.) He shows a credible intent to avoid such conduct in the future. He \nis recently employed after a successful college career. Applicant\u2019s evidence, including his \ntestimony, showed a person who is determined to act with maturity in the future. That is \nconfirmed by his statements to the LMFT who prepared Applicant Exhibit H after \nexamining Applicant this year. Viewing his minor marijuana and mushroom use in the \ncontext of the whole person Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his past \ndrug use.

Applicant has no alcohol-related incidents, either at work or away from work. \nThere is no history of binge drinking to the point of impaired judgment. Applicant Exhibit \nH is a report from an LMFT who examined him this year and found no evidence to support \na finding that he had an alcohol issue. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nAs stated, Applicant used marijuana on an infrequent basis from 2015 to 2020. He \nused mushrooms on a single occasion. He has had contact with the people he used drugs \nwith, except for the person from whom he bought mushrooms. The cited disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are possibly applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs stated under Paragraph 1, above, Applicant\u2019s drug use was very infrequent, in \nthe past, and he evinces a credible intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future. He has \nmade sure that the people he used drugs with know that he is no longer comfortable with \nthat lifestyle, and that he will not be around drug users. Paragraph 2 was found for \nApplicant due to a lack of evidence. He has mitigated the security concerns raised in \nParagraph 3. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated his \nminor drug use. His forthright disclosures minimized or eliminated the potential for \npressure, coercion, or duress. Continuation or recurrence of similar conduct is unlikely. \nOverall, the record evidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

Also, he provided no information detailing his plans for resolving \nhis past-due indebtedness or demonstrating other indicia of trustworthiness. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has incurred about $19,000 in past-due accounts over the last several \nyears. Five of the SOR debts are for delinquent student loans totaling almost $11,000. \nThose debts became delinquent in 2014, and Applicant has made no effort to resolve \nthem. He conceded that the debts that are not student loans are due to his gambling \naddiction. He claimed that he paid one of the debts alleged in the SOR through the \ngarnishment of his wages (SOR 1.m \u2013 $412) and has resolved another debt (SOR 1.g \u2013 \n$560), but he provided no documentation. The SOR debts establish prima facie support \nfor the application of the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe record evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions \napply to debts set forth in the SOR. Aside from his acknowledged history of gambling \naddiction, Applicant has not offered any evidence or explanation for his failure to pay his \ndebts when due. Significantly, he failed to pay these debts and increased his risk of \ncoercion or duress while he held a security clearance. He did not provide any evidence \nshowing that he is engaging in a good-faith effort to responsibly resolve his debts, as \nwould be expected of someone entrusted with the privilege of holding national security \neligibility. Several of Applicant\u2019s large delinquencies are student loans owed to the U.S. \nGovernment that he has practically ignored. Also, he did not submit any financial \ninformation from which I can make a finding that he is capable of resolving these debts in \na reasonable, responsible, and timely fashion. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his past-due indebtedness. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance at the present time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.
