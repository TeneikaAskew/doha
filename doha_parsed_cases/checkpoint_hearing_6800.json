Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: David P. Price, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nAfter reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s most recent background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to\nmake a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national\n1\ninterest to give Applicant a security clearance. On August 28, 2007, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline E (personal\n2\nconduct), Guideline H (drug involvement), and Guideline J (criminal conduct).\nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on November 18, 2007, and I scheduled a hearing to be held on\nDecember 10, 2007. The parties appeared as scheduled. Without objection, I admitted\nfive exhibits offered by the government (Gx. 1 - 5). Applicant testified in his own behalf,\npresented three witnesses, and offered 37 documents, which were sorted by topic into\nfour exhibits and admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - D. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on December 20, 2007. Based on the facts and conclusions\nset forth below, Applicant\u2019s request for continued access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the government alleged in SOR \u00b61.a that Applicant was\narrested in February 2005 and charged with possession of marijuana, for which he\nreceived a 30-day suspended jail sentence, and assessed a fine and court costs.\nThrough SOR \u00b61.b, the government alleged that the same arrest also included charges\nof assault and battery and abduction/kidnaping stemming from a warrant issued against\nhim a few months earlier. The latter charge was entered nolle prosequi, and the assault\ncharge was dismissed after he completed two years of good behavior. Through SOR\n\u00b61.c, the government alleged Applicant received non-judicial punishment while in the\nU.S. Air Force in 1989 for wrongful use of a controlled substance (marijuana). Applicant\nadmitted these allegations.\nUnder Guideline H, the government alleged in SOR \u00b62.a that Applicant used\nmarijuana at least seven times between 2004 and 2005. In SOR \u00b62.b, it was alleged he\nused marijuana while holding a security clearance. In SOR \u00b62.c, the government cross-\nalleged his marijuana use from SOR \u00b61.c. Applicant admitted these allegations.\nUnder Guideline E, the government cross-alleged in SOR \u00b62.a Applicant\u2019s\nmarijuana use from SOR \u00b62.c. Applicant admitted this allegation. After a thorough\nreview of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings\nof fact.\nApplicant is 45 years old and works for a defense contractor at a U.S. Navy\nshipyard as a radiation control technician/monitor. He has held this job since leaving the\nU.S. Air Force in 1989 after a four-year enlistment. He was promoted to a supervisory\nposition in late 2006. His duties involve close work with nuclear materials, nuclear\nwaste, and related equipment and systems. Applicant has held a security clearance the\nentire time he has worked at the shipyard. (Gx. 1; Tr., 91, 94)\nApplicant and his wife were married in 1988. They have two children, ages 18\nand 14. In late 2003, Applicant was sent on temporary duty (TDY) for nine months to\nanother Navy shipyard. While on TDY, he began an affair with another woman. The\naffair continued even after the TDY ended and he returned home. At times, she would\ntravel to see him after he returned home from TDY. Their relationship lasted until\nFebruary or March 2005. Applicant has had no contact with her since the relationship\nended. (Ax. A; Tr., 86 - 87)\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend smoked marijuana and Applicant used it with her about\nseven times between about November 2004 and February 2005. He had first\nexperimented with marijuana in high school. (Tr., 106) He also used marijuana at least\nonce while in the Air Force, for which he received non-judicial punishment under Article\n15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). He was reduced in rank, forfeited \u00bd\nhis monthly pay for two months, and ordered to confinement for 30 days, which was\nsuspended. He was 28 years old at the time. (Gx. 4; Tr., 78)\nApplicant and his wife separated in August 2004. In November 2004, they had an\nargument while sitting in his car. His wife tried to leave but he grabbed her and kept her\nfrom getting out of the car before eventually letting her leave. The next day they had\nanother fight, after which she went to the police and reported what happened in the car\nthe day before. She testified she only wanted a restraining order and did not intend to\nhave Applicant charged with anything, but a warrant for his arrest was issued charging\nhim with abduction/kidnaping and assault and battery. Applicant was not immediately\narrested. (Ax. A; Tr., 82)\nOn February 15, 2005, Applicant was taking his girlfriend to the airport after one\nof her visits. She had a small amount of marijuana in her possession, and Applicant\nsuggested she leave it with him rather than risk trying to take it with her through airport\nsecurity. A few hours after he dropped her off at the airport, Applicant was in a car\naccident to which the police responded. When they checked his driver\u2019s license, they\nsaw he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest based on his wife\u2019s complaint the\nprevious November. During a search incident to arrest, the police found the marijuana\non his person and charged him with possession. He was later found guilty, assessed a\nfine and court costs, and given a 30-day jail sentence, suspended for two years. As for\nthe assault and kidnaping charges, the latter was entered nolle prosequi. The assault\ncharge was dismissed after Applicant completed an anger management course and two\nyears of probation. (Ax. A; Gx. 2; Gx. 5; Tr., 110 - 111)\nApplicant held a security clearance at all times that he used marijuana in 2004\nand 2005. (Gx. 6) He has never used drugs at work or before reporting to work. He was\nalso aware that the Department of Defense (DoD) does not permit illegal drug use by its\nemployees, and he receives refresher training about the DoD drug policy every year.\n(Tr., 104)\nApplicant and his wife reconciled in about November 2006. Even during their\nseparation, he stayed close to his children and helped out however he could. (Tr., 48)\nHe enjoys a good reputation for reliability and integrity at work and in the community.\nHis finances are sound and his performance evaluations at work have been generally\noutstanding. (Ax. A; Ax. D)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n3\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and\n4\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n3\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n4\nmitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties at hearing require consideration of the security concerns and\nadjudicative factors addressed under Guideline E (personal conduct), at AG \u00b615,\nGuideline H (drug involvement), at AG \u00b624, and Guideline J (criminal conduct), at AG\n\u00b630.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct.\nUnder Guideline J, \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b630) The government\u2019s\n\n5\nexhibits, along with Applicant\u2019s admissions and testimony, are sufficient to support the\nSOR allegations in SOR \u00b61. Applicant pleaded guilty to marijuana possession in 2005.\nAlthough he was not convicted of either the assault and battery charge or the\nkidnapping/abduction charge, the record shows he grabbed his wife and restrained her\nagainst her will as they argued. The assault charge was held in abeyance for two years\nto ensure Applicant would behave responsibly for two years. He was also required to\ncomplete an anger management course before the charge was dismissed. Applicant\nalso received non-judicial punishment in 1989 for violating the UCMJ by using marijuana\nwhile he was in the Air Force. These facts require application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed in AG \u00b631(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and\nAG \u00b631(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted).\nWith respect to his assault and kidnaping arrests, available information also\nmakes applicable the mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b632(a) (so much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b632(d) (there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement). Applicant has\nexcelled at work, and he has a solid reputation among his friends and co-workers for\nreliability, honesty, and trustworthiness. The charges related to Applicant\u2019s argument\nwith his wife are not likely to recur. He and his wife have reconciled, his affair ended and\nhe has not seen his former girlfriend in nearly three years. Nor have there been any\nsuch incidents between Applicant and his wife since they ended their separation.\nHowever, the benefit of AG \u00b632(d) is tempered when assessing the security\nsignificance of his drug-related offenses. He was punished for using marijuana in 1989\nwhen he was 28 years old and serving in the Air Force. His next use was in 2004, when\nhe was 44 years old and working in the defense industry at a nuclear shipyard. In each\ninstance, he knew that marijuana use was expressly prohibited by DoD policy. When he\nused marijuana in 2004 and 2005, he did so despite receiving annual training about\nDoD\u2019s drug policy over the course of his career. He also knowingly and wilfully took\npossession of his girlfriend\u2019s marijuana when he dropped her at the airport in 2005.\nGiven Applicant\u2019s long association with DoD and the security requirements of his job\nhandling nuclear materials, the seriousness of his drug-related criminal conduct cannot\nbe overstated. On balance, security concerns remain about Applicant\u2019s criminal\nconduct.\nDrug Involvement. \nThe security concern expressed under Guideline H is that \u201c[u]se of an illegal drug\nor misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions\nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG\n24) Along with Applicant\u2019s admissions and testimony, available information is sufficient\nto support the allegations in SOR \u00b62. Applicant first used marijuana in high school. Ten\n\n6\nyears later, he used it again while in the Air Force. His most recent use occurred\nbetween about November 2004 and February 2005, more than 15 years after he was\npunished by the Air Force for illegal drug use. Applicant held a security clearance as\npart of his duties at a Navy nuclear shipyard. As noted under Guideline J, above, there\ncan be no question Applicant was fully aware of the DoD prohibition against using\nmarijuana, yet he knowingly violated that policy. These facts make applicable the\ndisqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b625(a) (any drug abuse ...), AG \u00b625(c) (illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia), and AG \u00b625(g) (any illegal drug use\nafter being granted a security clearance). Before the adjudicative guidelines were\nrevised in December 2005, the disqualifying condition in paragraph E2.A8.1.2.5 of the\nDirective addressed illegal drug use while holding a security clearance as follows:\nFailure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a\ncredentialed medical professional. Recent drug involvement, especially\nfollowing the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to\ndiscontinue use, will almost invariably result in an unfavorable\ndetermination.\nThe language of AG \u00b625(g) requires greater scrutiny of drug use while cleared\nand does not contemplate exceptions due to the passage of time. Accordingly, the fact\nthat Applicant\u2019s use of drugs while cleared is nearly three years old does not lessen its\nseverity. \nIn response, Applicant argues, in part, that his Air Force drug use should be\ndiscounted as remote in time and a youthful indiscretion. However, security clearance\ndeterminations such as this may not be based on a piecemeal analysis of the facts, but\nmust take into account the record as a whole. This argument might be plausible were\nthe Applicant still a young person at the time. However, because he was 28 years old\nwhen he used marijuana in the Air Force, his conduct cannot be discounted as a\nbyproduct of youth or inexperience. All of the available information about Applicant\u2019s\ninvolvement with illegal drugs indicates he has been willing to disregard DoD policy and\nrisk possible criminal penalties by using illegal drugs. \nThe mitigating conditions in AG \u00b626(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\nand AG \u00b626(b)(3) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence) are applicable based on the information about\nApplicant\u2019s non-use in the past three years, his excellent work record, and his otherwise\nstable lifestyle. However, their potential benefit is greatly attenuated by the fact he\nrepeated his conduct 15 years after being punished for the same conduct further\nexacerbates the seriousness of his involvement with illegal drugs. Mitigation is also\nlimited by the scrutiny required by AG \u00b625(g). On balance, and for the same reasons\nthis conduct sustains the security concerns about Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, it also\nsustains the concerns about his drug use.\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 3, supra.\n9\n See footnote 7, supra. \n10\n7\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in AG\n\u00b615, is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nAvailable information supports the factual allegation under Guideline E. However, such\nconduct is specifically covered under Guideline H and must be addressed according to\nAG \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance), as discussed\nabove. Accordingly, the Guideline E allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a is resolved for the\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines E and J. I have also\nreviewed the record in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG 2(a).8\nApplicant is a mature adult who has been a good provider for his family despite the\ndifficulties he and his wife endured during their separation. He also appears to be a\ntrustworthy, honest individual. However, as a mature, responsible adult he has also\nengaged in conduct directly at odds with the position of trust he has held for the past 17\nyears. His drug use, which is also criminal conduct, last occurred three years ago and\nwas infrequent. But it was completely voluntary and remains a security concern\nbecause of the sensitive and hazardous nature of his duties, and because he repeated\nthe conduct despite his awareness of the prohibitions against it and despite having been\npunished for it by the military. The positive information about his job performance and\npersonal life is insufficient to mitigate the ongoing doubts about his suitability for\ncontinued access raised by the adverse information in his background. A fair and\ncommonsense assessment  of all of the available information shows that doubts about\n9\nhis suitability to hold a clearance persist because of his criminal conduct and use of\nillegal drugs. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the national interest.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst  Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.c:\nAgainst  Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.m. He denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c through 1.l. His admissions in the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is a 26-year-old electronics technician employed by a defense contractor. He previously served in the U.S. Marine Corps from July 2000 to July 2005 (GX 2). He held a security clearance in the Marine Corps (Tr. 48), and he currently holds an interim clearance (Tr. 14). In 2002, Applicant\u2019s mother became seriously ill, and he cosigned several accounts for her, including the delinquent charge accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.j, and 1.k (Tr. 72). When his mother passed away in August 2002 with virtually no money, Applicant became responsible for her debts (Tr. 37, 52). Applicant was married in April 2002, the same year his mother became ill. He was a private first class (pay grade E-3) at the time. His wife worked at a job paying slightly more than the minimum wage (Tr. 53). In January 2003, Applicant\u2019s son was born brain-damaged, and he died in August 2003. The medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i was incurred for his son\u2019s treatment, but it was not submitted to TRICARE. Applicant was unaware the claim had not been submitted, and he is in the process of submitting it (Tr. 36). After the death of their son, Applicant\u2019s wife became severely depressed and stopped working (Tr. 37-38, 5",

Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, and \nthey were admitted without objection.  \n \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit additional \nmatters.  On December 13, 2007, he submitted AX E through H, and they were \nadmitted without objection.  His facsimile cover sheet and index of additional exhibits is \nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I.  Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX E \nthrough H is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit II. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on December 14, 2007. The record closed on December 21, 2007. \nBased on the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.m.  He denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c through 1.l.  His \nadmissions in the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I \nmake the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old electronics technician employed by a defense \ncontractor.  He previously served in the U.S. Marine Corps from July 2000 to July 2005 \n(GX 2).  He held a security clearance in the Marine Corps (Tr. 48), and he currently \nholds an interim clearance (Tr. 14).   \n \n \nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s mother became seriously ill, and he cosigned several \naccounts for her, including the delinquent charge accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.j, \nand 1.k (Tr. 72).  When his mother passed away in August 2002 with virtually no money, \nApplicant became responsible for her debts (Tr. 37, 52). \n \n \nApplicant was married in April 2002, the same year his mother became ill.  He \nwas a private first class (pay grade E-3) at the time.  His wife worked at a job paying \nslightly more than the minimum wage (Tr. 53).   \n \nIn January 2003, Applicant\u2019s son was born brain-damaged, and he died in \nAugust 2003.  The medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i was incurred for his son\u2019s \ntreatment, but it was not submitted to TRICARE.  Applicant was unaware the claim had \nnot been submitted, and he is in the process of submitting it (Tr. 36).   \n \nAfter the death of their son, Applicant\u2019s wife became severely depressed and \nstopped working (Tr. 37-38, 53).  The combination of his mother\u2019s debts and his wife\u2019s \nloss of income caused him to fall behind on his own debt payments.  Applicant\u2019s wife \nreturned to work in early 2004 (Tr. 53). \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a was incurred when Applicant allowed his stepfather to \nuse his social security number to apply for a loan.  His stepfather moved to another \n\n \n3 \n \n \nstate and stopped making payments after Applicant\u2019s mother died, leaving Applicant \nresponsible for paying the debt. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is the same debt as \nalleged in \u00b6 1.a (Tr. 59-61). \n \n \nApplicant found a civilian job within a month after being discharged from the \nMarine Corps, earning about $35,000 per year (Tr. 47), more than he earned in the \nMarine Corps (Tr. 56).  He has worked for his current employer since January 2006 (Tr. \n40), and he currently earns about $55,000 per year (Tr. 48).  He is highly regarded by \nhis current supervisor, who described him as \u201ca consummate professional,\u201d and \ncommended him for his hard work and dedication (AX H).   \n \nIn August 2007, Applicant prepared a personal financial statement reflecting net \nmonthly income of $2,712, expenses of $2,160, debt payments of $122, and a net \nremainder of $480 (GX 2 at 17).  He did not include his wife\u2019s net monthly income about \n$1,000 per month or her car payment of $150, because at the time he was living with a \nroommate to save money, she was staying with her mother, and they decided to keep \ntheir income and expenses separate (Tr. 67). \n \n \nIn October 2007, the month following his receipt of the SOR, Applicant began \nworking with a credit counseling service to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, \n1.h, and 1.j.  As of the date of the hearing, he had made two monthly payments of $199 \nto the service (Tr. 40).  His payment plan provides for paying off the debts included in \nthe plan in three years (Tr. 64).   \n \n \nApplicant has submitted the necessary paperwork to withdraw funds from his \n401k retirement account to pay the delinquent rent alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b (Tr. 34).  He \nhas more than $5,000 in his retirement account (AX B). \n \n \nApplicant attempted to contact the collection attorney alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m but \ncould not locate him, after extensive on-line searches.  He located the original creditor, \nwho would not accept payment because the account had been sold (Tr. 72).  He has \nnever been contacted by the attorney (Tr. 73). \n \n \nWhen Applicant began falling behind on some of his debt payments, he reduced \nexpenses by disposing of an additional car, attempting to negotiate partial payments to \nhis creditors, and working off duty at part-time jobs (Tr. 55-56).  He paid off several \ndebts that no longer appear on his credit report and are not alleged in the SOR (Tr. 45, \n49). \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the \ntable below. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nSOR \nDebt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nStepfather\u2019s loan \n$2,883 \nCredit counseling plan \nTr. 34, 42; AX C \n1.b \nRent \n$1,235 \nTo be paid with 40lk loan\nTr. 34, 61, AX B \n1.c \nCable equipment \n$522 \nDebt resolved \nTr. 57-58 \n1.d \nStepfather\u2019s loan \n$2,555 \nSame as 1.a \nAX C \n1.e \nCar loan \n$156 \nPayments are current \nTr. 35; AX F at 10 \n1.f \nCable service \n$55 \nPaid \nTr. 44; GX 3 at 3 \n1.g \nMother\u2019s credit card $100 \nPaid \nTr. 35, AX G \n1.h \nJewelry \n$380 \nCredit counseling plan \nTr. 43; AX C \n1.i \nMedical \n$465 \nSubmitted to TRICARE \nTr. 36 \n1.j \nMother\u2019s credit card $3,782 \nCredit counseling plan \nTr. 36, 43; AX C \n1.k \nMother\u2019s credit card $281 \nSame as 1.g \nTr. 36, 71 \n1.l \nCredit card \n$132 \nPaid \nTr. 50; AX E at 2 \n1.m \nCollection attorney \n$584 \nCannot find attorney; \noriginal creditor will not \naccept payment \nTr. 36-37, 73 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . \n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person \naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. \nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the \napplicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  The government has \nthe burden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any \nof the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. \n95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in \nAG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline sets out several conditions that could raise security concerns. \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Finally, under AG \u00b6 19(e), a security concern can be \nraised by \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration, \nand/or other financial analysis.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts is sufficient to \nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@  If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.@ \n \n \nApplicant incurred numerous debts, some of which were resolved only recently \nand are not fully paid.  Thus, I conclude the first prong (\u201cso long ago\u201d) and second prong \n(\u201cso infrequent\u201d) are not established.  However, Applicant\u2019s financial problems occurred \nwhen he cosigned several obligations for his mother, and foolishly allowed his \nstepfather to use his (Applicant\u2019s) identity to obtain a loan.  The medical debt occurred \nbecause of the birth and subsequent death of his son.  Because these events are not \nlikely to recur, I conclude the third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) is established.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct facilitating his stepfather\u2019s fraudulent loan application \ndemonstrated bad judgment at the time, raising the question whether the final element \nof AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cconduct does not cast doubt . . . .\u201d) is established.  However, it occurred \nmore than five years ago, during a period when Applicant was dealing with multiple \ntragic events.  Since that incident, Applicant has matured, acted responsibly, and has \nearned a ringing endorsement from his current employer.  Thus, I am satisfied that his \nfoolish transaction with his stepfather does not cast doubt on his current good judgment, \nand I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \nperson\u2019s=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \nApplicant encountered several events beyond his control: his mother\u2019s illness \nand death, his stepfather\u2019s failure to keep his agreement to make loan payments, his \nson\u2019s death, and his wife\u2019s bouts of depression after their son\u2019s death.  His largest \ndebts, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.k, were attributable to his mother and \n\n \n7 \n \n \nstepfather.  He reacted to these events responsibly, paying what he could, negotiating \nwith creditors, disposing of a car, working a second job, and living apart from his wife \nwith a roommate to save money.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c).  Applicant \nsought help from a credit counseling agency and now has a negotiated payment plan \nthat includes his largest debts.  He is about three years away from completing his plan, \nbut the situation appears to be under control.  He is earning much more money than he \ndid in the Marine Corps, and he is living frugally.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@  AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant began resolving his financial situation before the SOR was issued.  He \nhas resolved his smaller debts and folded his large debts into a negotiated payment \nplan.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established. \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of these factors were addressed \nabove under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant served honorably in the Marine Corps for five years, and he held a \nsecurity clearance during his military service, apparently without incident.  His financial \ndifficulties arose from a series of family tragedies and a fraudulent loan application by \nhis stepfather.  He is now gainfully employed, financially stable, and highly regarded by \nhis supervisor.  He was sincere and candid at the hearing, and I found his testimony \ncredible. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the concerns based on financial considerations.  Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ncontinue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nMy formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25, are as follows: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on November 17,\n2006. On January 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and G for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on March 5, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 7,\n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 4, 2008. The government\noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and did not submit any exhibits. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 14, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\nApril 22, 2008\n\n2\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 13, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.c and \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b of the SOR, with explanations. He\nalso provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is 26 years old. He is single. After his high school graduation in 2000,\nhe attended college. After receiving his undergraduate degree in 2004, he began\nemployment with a defense contractor (GE 1). Since 2006, he has worked as a logistics\nsystem engineer. He does not hold a security clearance (Tr. 14).\nApplicant started drinking alcohol in high school with his friends. He drank beer\non the weekends. In June 2000, he was charged with underage possession of alcohol.\nAt the time he was at the beach for senior week activities. A complaint was received\nabout the noise where he was partying with his friends. The police were called and\nfound Applicant, age 18, and his friends drinking alcohol (Tr. 17). \nIn June 2003, Applicant was 21 years old. He went to the beach with some of his\ncollege friends. He was in a bar consuming alcohol. He and some other friends got into\na physical altercation. The police arrived arrested and charged him. The charges were\nfor (1) tumultuous behavior and (2) loitering in bar district. He was found guilty of charge\none. Charge two was dismissed. Applicant was fined (Tr. 18; GE 4).\nWhile he was in college, (freshman year) Applicant admitted drinking to the point\nof intoxication two times a week. He was disciplined for having alcohol in his dorm\nroom. He took an alcohol class (Tr. 29).\nIn January 2005, Applicant and some friends attended a football game. He had\nbeen drinking during the game. After the game was over, he was walking in the streets.\nThe crowd was rowdy and he got caught in the middle of a fracas. He was arrested for\ndisorderly conduct and assault. He was hospitalized after the police put him down. He\nspent the night in jail. The charge was nolle prosequi. He completed 24 hours of\ncommunity service. He also voluntarily attended an alcohol education class in his county\n(Tr. 20). He realized that he needed to change his drinking behavior, consume less\nalcohol and be more alert of his surroundings (Id).\nAt the time of the 2005 incident, Applicant was working for his current employer\n(defense contractor). He did not want them to find out about the incident for fear of\nlosing his job (Tr. 21).\nIn July 2006, Applicant rented a beach house with some acquaintances. He was\nnot familiar with the group of people at the house. One evening after socializing and\ndrinking at the bars, he returned home. He asserts the guys were rowdy. A verbal\nconfrontation led into a physical fight. One person head butted Applicant in his nose. He\n\n3\nwas hospitalized and obtained seven stitches (Tr. 22). At the hearing, Applicant\nproduced photos taken three days after the assault. The photos depicted the injury to\nhis nose. He was humiliated and afraid to present himself at work. He did not want his\nmanagers to know the real reason for the injuries. He told them the injury resulted from\na volleyball incident. He feared that he might lose his job if he told them the real reason\n(Tr. 23). \nApplicant pressed charges against the person who attacked him. In return,\ncharges were pressed against Applicant. Applicant returned to the beach town to face\nthe charges. The police charged Applicant with terroristic threats and offensive touching\n(Tr. 25). The court nolle prossed the charge. The other person paid for Applicant\u2019s\nhospital bills. Applicant has decided not to return to the beach because the group binge\ndrinks and he has changed his behavior (Tr. 26). \nApplicant admits that he may have a drink three times a week, generally on the\nweekends. He is more cautious about where he drinks and with whom he drinks. He\nassociates with other professionals who share the same lifestyle. He will go to a friend\u2019s\nhouse or go out to a bar with friends. He drinks in moderation because he realizes the\nimpact this might have on his career. He weighs approximately 164 pounds and knows\nthat after three beers he might be legally intoxicated. He does not stagger or have\nslurred speech but he realizes that he could be intoxicated using the legal definition (Tr.\n39). \nApplicant was credible in his testimony that he limits his drinking. He is more\naware and alert as to the amount of alcohol he drinks and with whom. He associates\nwith other like-minded career individuals (Tr. 41). He only drinks in what he considers a\ncontrolled or safe place. \nApplicant\u2019s work performance is good. He is a hard worker. He is now aware that\nthe party lifestyle interferes with a professional life and could jeopardize his career. He\nbelieves he has matured in the last years. He has a good deal of responsibility at work.\nHe manages the operations of a department. He is part of a strategic development team\nfor his company. He participates in discussions with vice-presidents, directors and\nmangers of his company (Tr. 51). He recently purchased a home which he is\nrefurbishing with the help of his Father.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\n\n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation\n\n5\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related charges and arrests from 2000 until July 2006,\nconstitute criminal activity as envisioned under \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c).\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement;\nApplicant has had no infractions with the law since July 2006. He was younger\nwhen he was involved in the incidents that involved drinking. He does not associate with\nthe same people as before. He is cognizant of his behavior and that drinking\nexcessively could jeopardize his career. He has been employed with the same company\nfor a number of years. He has a responsible job with management duties. He did\ncomplete an alcohol class after his 2003 incident. He has modified his alcohol\nconsumption as described above. Applicant has mitigated allegations 1. a through 1.d\nby the passage of time and by a successful change in his conduct, drinking and\nassociations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d and \u201c(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nIn this case, Applicant had an underage alcohol possession charge in 2000. He\nwas involved in an incident in college in 2003 after he had been drinking. The two\ncharges for disorderly conduct and offensive touching in 2005 and 2006 were both nolle\n\n6\nprossed. He admitted he was drinking during those times to the point of intoxication.\nThus, AG \u00b6 22 (a) and (c) apply.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(C) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a\ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and\nrelapse, and is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant\u2019s last incident involving alcohol was in July 2006. The incident was not\ntotally his fault. In fact the charge was dismissed. Since that time, he has not had any\nother alcohol-related incidents. His career is important to him. He has changed his\nsocial life since his high school and college days. I conclude there is mitigation under\n23(a).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant drank when he was in high school and college with his friends at\nparties and sometimes at a bar. He was drinking during his senior week when he was\ncharged with underage possession of alcohol in 2000. Applicant was caught up in an\nincident with friends at the beach in 2003. He had been drinking. The charges in 2005\nand 2006 for incidents involving alcohol were dismissed. Applicant explained the\ncircumstances. The last incident resulted in a physical altercation after drinking and\nsomeone injuring him. He pressed charges and charges were then brought against him.\nHe realizes that this kind of party lifestyle is detrimental to his career.\nHe has been employed with a defense contractor for several years. He has a\nposition of responsibility. His demeanor at the hearing reflected his seriousness toward\nthe issue of drinking to intoxication. He acknowledged at the hearing that he no longer\nassociates with the group of people at the beach. He is aware of his alcohol\nconsumption. He drinks with friends at home or in a safe environment. He has matured\nand accepted responsibility for the actions that occurred in the past.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence does\nnot leave me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from criminal conduct and alcohol consumption. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nBetween 1999 and 2005, Applicant accrued approximately $22,000 of delinquent debt. All\nof this debt related to expenses he incurred while struggling to afford a prestigious, expensive private\ncollege without any financial help from his impoverished parents. Since graduating, he obtained a\njob, has received two raises, and has entered a payment plan to address the delinquencies. Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\nanswered the SOR on August 9, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 22, 2007. On August 30, 2007, DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing scheduling it for September 11, 2007. Applicant waived his right to 15-days notice\nof hearing. During the hearing, I received two government exhibits, 11 Applicant exhibits, and the\ntestimony of two Applicant witnesses. DOHA received the transcript on September 21, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR , and they are incorporated into the findings\nof fact. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 26-year-old single man with a five-year-old daughter. He earned a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in business administration in January 2006. \nShortly after graduating, Applicant began working for a defense contractor as a technical\ncommunications coordinator (Exhibit 1). His responsibilities included writing requests for proposals.\nLater, he was promoted to the position of information technology manager, where he currently\nserves. His duties include installing networks, servicing computers, and training staff (Tr. 17). \nApplicant is highly respected at work. According to his supervisor, he is an exceptionally\nambitious young man with a high degree of maturity who has performed admirably(Exhibit E, Tr.\n45-48). He has been rewarded for his outstanding performance with two raises (Exhibits E through\nG). \nApplicant was the first person in his family ever to attend college (Tr. 36). Tuition was\n$38,000 per year (Tr. 22). Because his family was poor, they were unable to help him financially (Tr.\n35). Through a combination of grants, scholarships, and work-study programs, Applicant was able\nto pay the annual tuition (Tr. 22). He underestimated the additional costs, such as books, lodging,\ntransportation, and food. \n\n3\nHe began applying for credit cards to meet these expenses. As a young man who had just\nfinished high school, he \u201cdid not fully understand\u201d how quickly credit card debt could accrue (Tr.\n21, 43). He attempted to stay current with his credit card bills, but as time passed, what he was\nearning part-time through his work-study scholarship was not enough to cover the living expenses\nhe was charging on his credit cards (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s finances were stretched further by the birth of his daughter while he was in\ncollege.  He was unable to satisfy his child support obligation (Exhibit J).\nBy the time Applicant graduated, he had accrued 14 delinquent accounts in the approximate\namount of $22,000. Nine are owed to credit card companies (1.a, 1.c, 1.f through 1.j, 1.m and 1.n).\nThe remainder includes a medical bill (1.b), a late car note payment (1.d), a delinquent phone bill\n(1.l), a child support delinquency (1.e), and a debt owed to a community college Applicant attended\nfor a semester (1.k).\nApplicant has been satisfying the delinquent child support obligation since April 2007\n(Exhibit H). Currently, he pays $135 per week, $60 of which is applied toward the arrearage (Id. at\n2).\nThe other delinquencies lingered for approximately 18 months after Applicant graduated. He\nlacked the extra income to make any payments (Tr. 20). When Applicant received his most recent\nraise in August 2007, he consulted a credit counselor (Exhibit A). With the help of the counselor,\nhe consolidated all of his debts except the child support delinquency into a payment plan. Under the\nplan, he will pay $800 each month for the next 30 months (Exhibit A, Tr. 19). He made his first\npayment on September 5, 2007 (Exhibit A).\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2)the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nThe following adjudicative guideline is raised:\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n1\n4\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n1\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, FC DC 19(c):\na history of not meeting financial obligations, and FC DC 19(e): consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. Applicant did not accrue the delinquencies through\nfrivolous spending. Instead, he accrued them while struggling to put himself through college. As his\nfinancial outlook gradually improved, he began satisfying his delinquencies, first organizing a child\nsupport payment plan, and later organizing a payment plan for the other delinquencies. Also, he is\nworking with a credit counselor. \nUpon evaluating the unique circumstances leading to the accrual of the delinquencies, the\nprofessional assistance Applicant has sought to satisfy them, and his current progress, I conclude that\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(a): the behavior occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, FC MC 20(c): the person is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control, and FC MC\n20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors, apply. Applicant has\nmitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\n\n5\nAlthough Applicant entered into a debt payment plan, and has been making payments toward\nthe satisfaction of the child support delinquency since April 2007, his debt still exceed $20,000.  Any\nnegative inference generated by this fact is greatly outweighed by the unique circumstances that led\nto his debts, the subsequent steps to resolve them, and his strong character. As a first-generation\ncollege student from a poor family, he could have easily foregone his college of choice given its high\ntuition. Instead, he successfully managed to procure enough scholarships and financial aid to enable\nhim to pay his tuition. Although he was unable to afford the college\u2019s miscellaneous costs without\naccruing delinquent debt, he managed to earn his degree. Evaluating this case in the context of the\nwhole person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.n:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nMarc E. Curry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant\u2019s admissions to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.s are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough review of the pleadings, the information provided with Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the information provided in the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 58 years old and works as a structural mechanic for a defense contractor. He has held his current job since October 2005. He served in the United States Navy from June 1976 until October 1997. Upon his retirement, he went to work as an aircraft mechanic for a large aircraft manufacturing company. In July 1999, he was laid off from his job and was unemployed until he found work as a truck driver, which he did from December 1999 until January 2002.

MALONE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nAlison O\u2019Connell, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns about the fact he owes more than $44,000\nin unpaid credit cards and other personal credit accounts, some of which have been in collection\nsince 2001. He has not acted to resolve his debts and presented no information showing his financial\nproblems will not continue. Clearance is denied.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n FORM, Item 5.\n3\n FORM, Item 9.\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 10, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance required for his employment with a defense\ncontractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance.\n1\nOn June 29, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise\nsecurity concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines  under Guideline F (financial\n2\nconsiderations). Specifically, the SOR alleged Applicant owes at least $44,000 in delinquent debt\nconsisting of 20 unpaid personal credit accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.t).  \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, admitted all but two of the allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nand 1.t), and requested a decision without a hearing. On August 22, 2007, Department Counsel\nsubmitted the government\u2019s case in a File of Relevant Materials (FORM), which Applicant received\non September 5, 2007. Applicant was given 30 days to respond to the FORM, but he did not do so.\nThe case was assigned to me on November 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.s are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough\nreview of the pleadings, the information provided with Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the\ninformation provided in the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 58 years old and works as a structural mechanic for a defense contractor. He has\nheld his current job since October 2005. He served in the United States Navy from June 1976 until\nOctober 1997. Upon his retirement, he went to work as an aircraft mechanic for a large aircraft\nmanufacturing company. In July 1999, he was laid off from his job and was unemployed until he\nfound work as a truck driver, which he did from December 1999 until January 2002. From January\n2002 until March 2004, he held a variety of jobs, but was also unemployed at times for a total of 13\nmonths.  \n3\nIn his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed his wages had been garnished twice in the previous seven\nyears to pay delinquent debts. He also disclosed he was then, or had been in the previous seven years,\ndelinquent on at least nine debts. A credit report  obtained in 2006 during his background\n4\n\n FORM, Item 6.\n5\n FORM, Item 4.\n6\n Directive. 6.3.\n7\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness\n8\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n9\n3\ninvestigation showed he owed more than $40,000 in unpaid debts, many of which had been referred\nfor collection. At the time of the report he was also three months late on his mortgage.\nApplicant\u2019s current job pays him about $3,500 gross monthly. He also receives $1,500\nmonthly in military retired pay. Additionally, his wife earns $1,100 gross monthly. After taxes and\nother deductions, they take home $5,616 each month. After monthly expenses and a single car\npayment, Applicant and his wife realize a monthly net cash flow of about $2,286.5\nApplicant has paid a delinquent $533 state tax bill (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and a delinquent $71 cable\nTV bill (SOR \u00b6 1.t). He also told a government investigator he intends to file for bankruptcy\nprotection as a means of resolving his debts. Otherwise, he has taken no action to pay or otherwise\nresolve his remaining debts.6\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination\nbased on examination of all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the\npertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.  Decisions must\n7\nalso reflect consideration of the factors listed in the \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or\n8\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against\nan applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to\nclassified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require\nthat Revised Adjudicative Guideline F (financial considerations) be applied.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n9\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n11\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\n12\n \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d \n13\n \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d\n14\n \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\n15\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances;\u201d\n4\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n10\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.11\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations. Under Guideline F, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  The\n12\ngovernment presented sufficient information to support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.t.\nAdditionally, Applicant admitted all but two of the SOR allegations. Available information shows\nthat since about 2001, Applicant has owed more than $40,000 in delinquent debt accrued through\napparent misuse of personal credit. The available information requires consideration of Guideline\nF disqualifying conditions 19(a)  and 19(c).\n13\n14\nIn response, available information suggests Guideline F mitigating condition 20(b)  should\n15\nbe considered. Applicant\u2019s employment history between 1999 and 2005 included several periods of\nunemployment and his claim he was underemployed through much of that time is plausible.\nHowever, application of mitigating condition 20(b) also requires reasonable action under the\ncircumstances. Applicant\u2019s income since 2005 has provided him the means to pay more than the two\ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.t) he has satisfied to date, yet he has taken no other action to resolve his\ndebts. Accordingly, he may not benefit from 20(b). As he has not presented any information to\nsupport any other mitigating conditions, he has failed to overcome the security concerns about his\nunpaid debts. \nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in section 2(a) of the Revised\n\n See footnote 8, supra.\n16\n See footnote 11, supra.\n17\n See footnote 7, supra.\n18\n5\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  It is noteworthy that Applicant served more than 20 years in the military.\n16\nFurther, it appears he kept trying to find work through adverse times after he was laid off in 1999,\nwhich speaks well of his sense of responsibility. Yet, his inaction in addressing his debts since he\nhas had steady income that yields a significant positive cash flow each month far outweighs these\npositive inferences about his character and judgment. Applicant is presumed to be a mature adult,\nbut has failed to show how, if at all, his past financial problems will not recur in the future. \nDespite the recent improvement in his employment, his continued inaction regarding his\ndebts sustains the government\u2019s doubts about his judgment and trustworthiness. Such doubts must\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.  A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available\n17\n18\ninformation before me shows that the Applicant has failed to overcome the government\u2019s reasonable\ndoubts about his ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment\nand discretion expected of one who holds a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b - 1.s:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nFor the Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRomeo G. Lumaban, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 16, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested that the case be decided on the written record.  On July\n10, 2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Joseph Testan denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\nregarding Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification were supported by the record evidence; whether the\nJudge properly applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions; and whether statements by\nDepartment Counsel or the Chief of the Personnel Security Division improperly affected the\ndisposition of the case. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:\nApplicant is 54 years of age.  He has worked for the same defense contractor employer since\n1993.\nIn 1976, Applicant was charged with Brandishing a Firearm.  He was convicted of the charge,\nfined, and sentenced to 60 days in jail.  The jail sentence was suspended.  In 1985, Applicant was\ncharged with (1) Felony Possession of Marijuana and (2) Conspiracy to Distribute and Possession\nWith Intent to Distribute a Controlled Substance (Marijuana).  He was convicted of the latter charge\nand sentenced to five years in prison.  He served over one year in prison.\n In 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of Marijuana.  The charge was\ndismissed.  In 1997, Applicant was arrested for Assault and Battery on a Family Member.  The\ncharge was dismissed. \nApplicant falsified material facts about his criminal history in response to three separate\nquestions on an Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ) he executed on October 18,\n2006.  In response to Question 21, which asked: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of\nany felony offense?\u201d Applicant responded \u201cno.\u201d This response was false.  In response to Question\n22, which asked: \u201dHave you ever been charged with or convicted of a firearms or explosives\noffense?\u201d Applicant responded \u201cno.\u201d This response was false.  In response to Question 24, which\nasked: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d\nApplicant responded \u201cno.\u201d  This response was also false.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he falsified material facts on the EPSQ,\nbut offered the following statements in explanation.  With respect to Question 21, he stated: \u201c[the\nfalsification] was not intentional as it had been more than twenty years and as I understood it, it was\nto go back ten years.\u201d  With respect to Question 22, he stated: \u201cThis occurrence happened thirty-one\nyears ago and I did not realize I had to disclose it.\u201d  With respect to Question 24, he stated: \u201cI did\n\n3\nnot realize it had to be disclosed as it happened more than twenty years ago.\u201d  In view of the\nstraightforward nature of the questions, and Applicant\u2019s failure to offer any evidence as to how he\nallegedly came to believe he was \u201cto go back ten years,\u201d his denial of an intent to deceive is not\ncredible.\n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact regarding Applicant\u2019s deliberate\nfalsification were not supported by the record evidence.  The Board does not find this argument\npersuasive.\nThe Judge included Applicant\u2019s explanations for his falsifications in his decision, although\nit is clear from the decision that the Judge did not find Applicant\u2019s explanation credible.  Under the\nDirective, the Board must give deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nThe Judge found that Applicant was involved in multiple criminal offenses between 1976\nand 1997 and that he falsified his EPSQ. The Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation for his failure to disclose the requested information.  The Judge was not bound, as a\nmatter of law, to accept Applicant\u2019s explanation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01676 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJun. 11, 2007).  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the evidence as a whole,\nand concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions were deliberate and\nintentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are sustainable. See\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\n(2) Applicant argues that the  Judge did not properly apply the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guidelines E and J is\nsustainable.\n\n4\n(3) Applicant argues that statements by Department Counsel or the Chief of the Personnel\nSecurity Division improperly affected the disposition of the case.   The Board does not find this\nargument persuasive.\nOn appeal, under the heading \u201cSpecific Claims of Factual and/or Legal Error,\u201d Applicant\ncites to language in the SOR signed by the Chief of the Personnel Security Division and in the File\nof Relevant Material prepared by Department Counsel.  Neither the pleadings nor the statements of\nadversarial counsel are the basis for the Board\u2019s review of an ISCR decision.  The Board has\nauthority to review the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether harmful error occurred.\nSee Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28-E3.1.35.  Thus, the Administrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant\na clearance. \nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

In response to Question 21, which asked: \u201cHave you 1 ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?\u201d applicant responded \u201cno.\u201d This response was false because, as noted above, he had been charged with and convicted of a felony in 1985. In response to Question 22, which asked: \u201dHave you ever been charged with or convicted of a firearms or explosives offense?\u201d applicant responded \u201cno.\u201d This response was false because, as noted above, he was charged with and convicted o",

Duffy, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 10, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn October 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines E and J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 2, 2007, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 8, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on March 27, 2008. Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\nThis finding is based on applicant\u2019s admissions to SOR Allegations 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. The worksheet the\n1\nGovernment submitted with the FORM (Exhibit 5) is not a substitute for the actual EPSQ.\nThe fact that applicant did not disclose his 1996 drug charge in response to this question was not alleged\n2\nby the Government.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 54 years of age. He has worked for the same defense contractor\nemployer since 1993. He has been married to his current spouse since 1979.\nIn 1976, applicant was charged with Brandishing a Firearm. He was convicted of\nthe charge, fined, and sentenced to 60 days in jail. The jail sentence was suspended.\nIn 1985, applicant was charged with (1) Felony Possession of Marijuana and (2)\nConspiracy to Distribute and Possess With Intent to Distribute a Controlled Substance\n(Marijuana). He was convicted of the latter charge and sentenced to five years in prison.\nHe served over one year in prison.\nIn 1996, applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of Marijuana. The\ncharge was dismissed.\nIn 1997, applicant was arrested for Assault and Battery on a Family Member. The\ncharge was dismissed.\nApplicant falsified material facts about his criminal history in response to three\nseparate questions on an Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ) he\nexecuted on October 18, 2006.   In response to Question 21, which asked: \u201cHave you\n1\never been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?\u201d applicant responded \u201cno.\u201d\nThis response was false because, as noted above, he had been charged with and\nconvicted of a felony in 1985. In response to Question 22, which asked: \u201dHave you ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of a firearms or explosives offense?\u201d applicant\nresponded \u201cno.\u201d This response was false because, as noted above, he was charged\nwith and convicted of Brandishing a Firearm in 1976. In response to Question 24, which\nasked: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to\nalcohol or drugs?\u201d applicant responded \u201cno.\u201d This response was also false because, as\nnoted above, he was convicted of a drug-related charge in 1985.2\nIn his response to the SOR, applicant admitted that he falsified material facts on\nthe EPSQ, but offered the following statements in explanation. With respect to Question\n21, he stated: \u201c[the falsification] was not intentional as it had been more than twenty\nyears and as I understood it, it was to go back ten years.\u201d With respect to Question 22,\nhe stated: \u201cThis occurrence happened thirty-one years ago and I did not realize I had to\ndisclose it.\u201d With respect to Question 24, he stated: \u201cI did not realize it had to be\ndisclosed as it happened more than twenty years ago.\u201d In view of the straightforward\nnature of the questions, and applicant\u2019s failure to offer any evidence as to how he\nallegedly came to believe he was \u201cto go back ten years,\u201d his denial of an intent to\ndeceive is not credible.\n\n3\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\n\n10 U.S.C. 986, which barred applicants who had served a year or more in prison as a result of a criminal\n3\nconviction from receiving a security clearance, was repealed. Accordingly, applicant is no longer subject to\nthis automatic bar.\n4\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. And, under Paragraph 31.c., an \u201callegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s multiple arrests and two\nconvictions raise these two disqualifying conditions.3\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. Under Paragraph 32.a., it may be mitigating if \u201cso much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s last criminal conviction was\nover 20 years ago; his last arrest was over ten years ago. This mitigation condition is\napplicable. Under Paragraph 32.c. it may be mitigating if there is \u201cevidence that the\nperson did not commit the offense.\u201d Based on the fact that the charges in 1996 and\n1997 were dismissed, this mitigating condition is applicable. Under Paragraph 32.d., it\nmay be mitigating if \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement.\u201d There is evidence of successful rehabilitation; namely, it has\nbeen over ten years since applicant\u2019s criminal activity, and he has a good employment\nrecord. Accordingly, this mitigating condition is applicable.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable because applicant intentionally provided false\nmaterial information on the EPSQ.\n\n5\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I\nconsidered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was young and immature\nwhen he was charged and convicted of the two serious crimes in the 1970s and 1980s.\nEven if the two dismissed charges from the 1990s were considered against applicant,\ngiven the passage of time since his last adverse contact with law enforcement, his\nstable home life, and his good employment record, he would have received a favorable\ndecision had his criminal conduct been the only issue raised by the SOR. But it wasn\u2019t.\nThe Government alleged and proved that applicant intentionally concealed his criminal\nhistory from the Government when he completed the EPSQ in 2006, less than two\nyears ago. The recency and extent of this dishonest conduct, together with his\nincredible explanations for it, preclude a finding that this type of conduct is unlikely to\nrecur. Based on the foregoing, I conclude that, although applicant mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from Guideline J, he failed to mitigate the security concerns arising\nfrom Guideline E.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline J: FOR APPLICANT\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Joel R. Rosenberg, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on December 5, 2006. On \nJanuary 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 1, 2008; answered it on \nFebruary 14, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on February 19, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on March 17, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on March 20, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 27, 2008, scheduling the hearing for April 3, \n2008. Applicant declined to waive the 15-day notice requirement of the Directive \u00b6 \nJuly 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nE3.1.8, and he requested additional time to retain counsel and prepare for the hearing. \nOn March 31, 2008, I granted Applicant\u2019s request. The email correspondence \nconcerning a hearing date is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I.  \n \nDOHA issued a second notice of hearing on May 12, 2008, scheduling the \nhearing for May 29, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf, presented the testimony of three witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through N, which were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to keep the record open until June 30, 2008, to enable him to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. Applicant timely submitted AX O through V, and they were \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX O through V is \nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit II. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on June 5, 2008. The record closed on June 30, 2008. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old security guard for a federal contractor. He has a high \nschool education. He has worked for his current employer since August 1980, and he \nhas held a clearance since January 1982. \n \n \nApplicant has been separated from his spouse since June 1990. He has four \nadult children and five grandchildren (Tr. 60-61). His spouse is self-supporting, but he \nkeeps her on his medical and dental insurance plan because she has no medical and \ndental benefits from her job (Tr. 61). \n \n \nA city police detective who has known Applicant for many years considers him \ndependable, responsible, courteous, and trustworthy. He described Applicant as \u201cthe \nmost honest and dependable person\u201d he knows (AX N). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter testified that her father has a good reputation in the \ncommunity for truthfulness and honesty. He is a very private person, and he is \u201cvery \ngiving\u201d at Christmas (Tr. 93-94). \n \n \nAn ordained minister and friend of Applicant who has known him for 29 years \ndescribed Applicant as quiet and reserved. He testified there has never been any \nreason to question Applicant\u2019s honesty or integrity (Tr. 98-100). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s son-in-law has known Applicant for about 13 years. He testified \nApplicant is a wonderful neighbor and a good citizen. \u201cEverybody loves him.\u201d He could \n\n \n3 \n \n \nnot imagine Applicant doing anything at work that would affect his employment or any \ngovernmental interest (Tr. 102-04). \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant inherited between $225,000 and $250,000 from his father. He \npromptly began spending money on his children and himself. In accordance with his \nfather\u2019s wishes, he gave each of his four children $5,000 apiece (Tr. 62). He bought two \ncars, extensively remodeled his home, bought gifts for his children and grandchildren, \npaid for the weddings of his two daughters, and paid for the honeymoon of one \ndaughter. He took his children to the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and twice to Disneyland \n(Tr. 75). He opened numerous credit card accounts, often because there was a discount \non the initial purchases if a new account was opened (Tr. 64). He admitted at the \nhearing that at Christmas he \u201cwent a little crazy\u201d for his children and grandchildren (Tr. \n64). Without realizing it, he spent more money than he inherited, and he accumulated \nmore credit card debt than he could pay. He used a home equity loan to pay about half \nthe debt. He began falling behind on his payments in 2005 and 2006 (Tr. 80). \n \n \nThe SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling about $22,552. Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport dated December 22, 2006 reflected that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was in \ngood standing (GX 3 at 6), and his credit report dated January 11, 2008 reflected a zero \nbalance on that account (GX 2 at 5). Department Counsel conceded that the debt for \n$394, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, had been paid (Tr. 18).  \n \nApplicant presented documentary evidence of partial payment of the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b (Answer to SOR; GX 4 at 7-8). He presented documentary and testimonial \nevidence that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.l, and 1.m had been paid in full (Tr. \n71; AX D, G, S, and T). He also presented evidence that monthly payments were being \nmade on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.j and 1.k (AX C, F, H, J, P, and Q). He \npresented evidence that other debts not alleged in the SOR were resolved, but he did \nnot link the evidence to the debts alleged in the SOR (AX B and C). He asserted that \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.n had been paid in full (Tr. 58; AX A), \nbut he presented no documentary evidence to support his assertion. \n \n \nApplicant recently started collecting Social Security, increasing his monthly \nincome by about $1,724 per month. His monthly net income is about $3,484, his living \nexpenses are about $845, his monthly mortgage payment is about $747, and his credit \ncard payments are about $630, leaving a net monthly remainder of about $1,261. In \nDecember 2007, he received a settlement for injuries in a car accident. His net recovery \nwas about $41,000 (Tr. 77). \n \n \nApplicant has about $12,000 in money market accounts, $3,000 in a savings \naccount, and about $2,000 in his checking account (Tr. 59). He owns two cars that are \npaid off, and they are worth a total of about $35,000 (Tr. 60). He owns his home, which \nis worth about $94,000 (Tr. 74). Applicant was on short-term disability from about July 4 \nto July 30, 2007 (GX 4 at 29), but the record does not reflect the financial impact, if any, \nof his disability. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ \n \n \nAll these disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. With respect to AG \n\u00b6 19(a), it appears that Applicant initially was unable to pay his debts; but he now has \nsufficient savings and income to pay them all, but he has not done so. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \n\n \n6 \n \n \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \nThe first two prongs (\u201cso long ago\u201d and \u201cso infrequent\u201d) are not established \nbecause Applicant incurred numerous delinquent debts, and some of them are not yet \nsatisfied. The third prong (\u201cunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u201d) is \nestablished. Applicant led a modest life until he inherited a large sum of money. He \nspent with abandon until he was deeply in debt. He is not likely to inherit or otherwise \nacquire such a large sum of money again.  \n \nThe fourth prong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d) is not established. Applicant exhibited \nextremely poor judgment by squandering his inheritance and not paying attention to his \nfinancial situation. Because his exercise of bad judgment was recent, continuing \nthrough 2005 and 2006, when his debts started becoming delinquent, it raises doubt \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). This mitigating condition is not established \nbecause Applicant\u2019s financial problems were totally the result of his voluntary acts. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established. Although he retained legal counsel for his \nhearing, there is no evidence he has sought or received financial counseling. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).   \n \nAlthough Applicant asserted that all debts alleged in the SOR were paid or \notherwise resolved, he failed to produce evidence to support his assertion that the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.n were paid in full. He has the financial resources \nto pay all his debts in full, but has not done so. He offered no reasonable explanation for \nnot paying off the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.j. and 1.k. He bears the burden of \nestablishing a mitigating condition, and he did not sustain his burden of establishing AG \n\u00b6 20(d).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult with a long record of faithful service to his employer. \nHe has held a security clearance for many years without incident. However, he did not \nexhibit the level of maturity and responsibility expected of a mature adult, a father, and a \ngrandfather when he squandered his inheritance and ruined his credit rating. His \ntestimony at the hearing was disjointed, and he did not appear to have a good grasp of \nthe facts. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.k: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.m: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

HOGAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nGina L. Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nSecurity concerns raised about Applicant's history of traffic violations are mitigated due to\nApplicant successfully completing all sentences related to his traffic violations and demonstrating\nan increased level of maturity. The security concern raised under financial considerations due to a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2004 is also mitigated. Applicant demonstrated that he is currently\nfinancially stable. An unforeseen lay-off caused the financial problems which lead to Applicant's\nbankruptcy. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\n Tr. at 4 - 5. \n2\n Tr. at 14, 16-17. \n3\n Gov 3. \n4\n2\nOn August 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued  Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statement dated September 20, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on\nOctober 10, 2007. On October 25, 2007, a notice of hearing was sent scheduling the hearing for\nNovember 9, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Applicant waived the 15 day notice\nrequirement provided in the Directive. The government offered three exhibits which were admitted\nas Government Exhibits (Gov) 1-3 without objection. The record was held open until December 10,\n2007, in order to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant timely submitted a 27\npage document that was admitted as AE A without objection.  The transcript was received on\nNovember 20, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his SOR response, Applicant admits to the all of the allegations in the SOR. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of\nfact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old man employed with a Department of Defense contractor who is\napplying for a security clearance. He has been with his current employer for over a year. He is single\nand has no children. In June 2006, he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Electronic Engineering.2\nIn early 2004, Applicant encountered financial problems as a result of being laid off from his\nfull-time job and the break up of an eight year relationship. He was laid off from his job due to a\nwork force reduction. He found a part-time job in July 2004, but did not find full-time employment\nuntil the end of 2004.  His annual salary was $14,000; a substantial reduction from his $26,000\nannual salary from his prior employer.   \n3\nOn May 18, 2004, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  He listed total assets of $1,150,\nand total liabilities of $16,963. The bankruptcy was discharged on August 24, 2004.4\nOn December 27, 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) in relation to his employment with the defense contractor. He listed his\n\n Gov 1. \n5\n Id.\n6\n Tr. at 15, 31.\n7\n Answer to SOR (The government provided no evidence in support of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.o.

In response to question 23d \"Have you ever been charged\n5\nwith or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\", he answered \"yes\" and listed a\nFebruary 2005, Operating While Intoxicated charge. He also answered \"yes\" in response to question\n23f \"In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not\nlisted in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the\nviolation was alcohol or drug-related.).\" He listed a March 2006 arrest for failure to use a turn signal;\ndriving on a suspended license; and possession of cannabis. All charges were dropped except the\ndriving on a suspended license.  The cannabis in the car belonged to another passenger in the car.\n6\n7\nApplicant's subsequent background investigation revealed that between March 1996 and\nAugust 2004, he was cited for 13 traffic offenses ranging from Failure to Maintain Safety Belts;\nSpeeding; Failure to Obey Signal Device, Operation Without Registration; Operating a Vehicle with\nLicense Suspended (Financial).(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.m).  Applicant was fined and ordered to pay court\n8\ncosts for each of these offenses. He completed the sentences imposed that were the result of his OUI\narrest in February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.o), and his arrest in March 2006 for Operating a Vehicle with a\nSuspended License (SOR \u00b6 1.n). His driver's license was reissued on April 3, 2007.  He is still\n9\npaying his attorney fees in relation to the DUI charge and the telephone company for the damage\ncaused when his car ran into a telephone poll. He has learned a lesson and has had no traffic violation\nsince March 2006.10\nSince his bankruptcy, Applicant's financial situation has stabilized.  Three months prior to\nthe hearing, he purchased a home.  His mother is an accountant and is helping him with his budget\nand making sure that he spends his money wisely.  His current budget indicates that he is capable\n11\nof meeting his monthly expenses. His monthly income is approximately $3,015.59. In December\n2007, his expenses will be approximately $1,643.37.  He will have approximately $1,372 left over\neach month after expenses.   He has one open credit card which has a current balance of $300.\n12\n13\n\n Tr. at 26; AE A at 16-27..\n14\n AE A at 6-11.\n15\n AE A at 2.\n16\n AE A at 4.\n17\n AE A at 3, 5. \n18\n Department of the Navy v.

He will be required\nto pay $154/month over the next 60 months beginning in December.14\nApplicant's recent performance evaluation which closed out on September 27, 2007, states\nthat he is fully successful in his job. His manager \"has confidence in his abilities.\" He notes that\nApplicant is still learning and will expand his knowledge within the next year.  Several of\n15\nApplicant's best friends wrote letters on his behalf. A co-worker who has worked with Applicant\nsince 2002, states Applicant is dependable and trustworthy. He further adds that he is \"organized\nefficient, extremely competent and has an excellent rapport with people...\"  Another co-worker who\n16\nhas known him for 15 years states that he is trustworthy, efficient and timely.  Two other individuals\n17\nmade similar favorable comments.18\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n19\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with rules an regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.20\n\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 18. \n21\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(a). \n22\n Id.\n23\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n24\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n25\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n26\n5\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.21\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n22\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n23\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n24\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.25\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n26\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the\nfollowing conclusions.\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant's extensive history of traffic violations raise a security concern under the personal\nconduct guideline. He was issued 15 traffic citations over a ten year period between March 1996 and\nMarch 2006.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse\ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination\nunder any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information) applies.  Applicant's extensive history of traffic violations\nraises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with rules and\nregulations.\nWhile Applicant's traffic offense history is extensive, he was in his late teens when he first\nstarted to incur traffic offenses.  He is now more mature and responsible. He has completed all of his\ncourt requirements.  He has not had an additional traffic offense in 20 months. For these reasons,\nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time\nhas passed, or the behavior, is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) applies.  \nFinancial Considerations\nIn 2004, Applicant experienced financial difficulties which resulted in his filing a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\napplies. \nThe concern under Financial Considerations can be mitigated. Applicant's financial situation\nhas been stable since his bankruptcy discharge in March 2004. He has been able to purchase a home\nand is not over extended on credit card debt. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC)\n\u00b6 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies.\nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\napplies in that Applicant ultimately decided for bankruptcy due to being laid off and unemployed for\nseveral months.  In addition, he incurred additional expenses after an eight year relationship ended.\n\n7\nHe has demonstrated that he is now financially stable. The circumstances leading to the bankruptcy\nwere beyond his control and he acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) applies.  Applicant resolved his delinquent debts through bankruptcy which\nis a legal way to resolve one's debts. He has not incurred additional delinquent debt since his\nbankruptcy discharge.  His current financial situation is stable.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties.\nIndeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness. I considered Applicant's current financial situation, the circumstances beyond his control\nwhich led to his filing for bankruptcy, the favorable recommendations from friends and co-workers,\nand his ownership of his past problems indicating a growth in maturity. Applicant is financially stable\nand has a plan in place to avoid financial problems in the future. The security concerns raised under\nfinancial considerations and personal conduct are mitigated. Based on the evidence in the record, it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is\ngranted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 2.

Daniel Lynch, Esquire \n                \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nBRAEMAN, Kathryn M., Administrative Judge: \n \nHistory of the Case \n \n           The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant on October 28, 2007.  The SOR detailed reasons why \nthe Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the \nApplicant.1 The SOR alleges specific concerns over alcohol consumption (Guideline G) \nbased on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and \nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. Applicant \nresponded to these SOR allegations in an Answer dated November 13, 2007, where he \nadmitted all the allegations and requested a hearing for which he retained counsel on \nDecember 18, 2007.  As discussed below, Applicant established his case in mitigation; \nclearance is granted. \n \n \n1 This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended and revised.   \nFebruary 21, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n            Department Counsel on December 20, 2007, indicated the case was ready to \nproceed.  The matter was assigned to me on December 20, 2007. Subsequently, a \nmutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to. A Notice of Hearing, issued on \nJanuary 2, 2008, set the hearing for January 25, 2008, at a location near where \nApplicant works and lives. \n \n            At the hearing the Government offered three exhibits (Exhibit 1-3), which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel offered seven exhibits (Exhibits A \nthrough G) which were admitted without objection, and called four witnesses including \nApplicant. The transcript (TR) was received on February 4, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n           After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon \ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \n   \n            Applicant, who is 37 years old, has been employed as a software consultant by \na defense contractor from March 2000 to present. He currently is doing product \nmanagement and software sales engineering. He completed a Security Clearance \nApplication (SF-86), signed in December 2005. He reported he previously was granted \na Top Secret clearance and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access in 2001 \nand had a Secret clearance granted in 1990.  He served in the Reserve Officers \nTraining Corps (ROTC) from 1988 to August 1989.  (Exhibit 1; TR 66)  \n \n            Applicant was granted a degree in mechanical engineering from a university in \nJune 1993.  (TR 67)  He married in July 1997.  (Exhibit 1) \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n           Applicant is now abstinent from alcohol consumption, but acknowledges he was \nan alcoholic because of his history of having difficulty stopping his drinking and having \nno control over alcohol.  (TR 67)  He has only one alcohol-related arrest when he was \narrested for Driving under the Influence (DWI) in 1992.  He then was found guilty and \nfined $500; he was sentenced to one month in jail, suspended, and required to attend \nan alcohol safety awareness class. He successfully completed the program and \nprobation.  (SOR 1.a.)  Applicant has not had any subsequent alcohol-related incidents. \n(Exhibits 1, 3; TR 88-89)   \n \n            Applicant subsequently resumed his use of alcohol to excess which led to \nexcessive absences from a job. He was terminated from this position because of the \nabsences.  He recognized that he needed to address his alcohol issues as he was \ndrinking four to five times a week. From 1998 to 1999, he voluntarily sought treatment \nfrom Dr. H, a medical doctor (M.D.) who is certified in addiction medicine.  (SOR 1.b.) \n(Exhibit 1, Answer; TR 69-71; 76-78) Dr. H diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent \nand recommended abstinence. After that treatment Applicant remained abstinent and \nattended some Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings for approximately a year.  (TR 70-\n71; 78-80) \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n            In December 2000 he went to a celebration and had three or four drinks.  (TR \n70-71; 78-80) After he resumed drinking alcohol, he drank usually in moderation, but at \ntimes to excess from late 2004 to September 2006.  He drank almost exclusively at \nhome, but he began to notice the adverse physical effects of alcohol.  For example, \ndrinking contributed to him being physically exhausted.  (TR 71-72; 82-88; 90) \n \n            Applicant\u2019s concerns over his use of alcohol led him to decide voluntarily again \nto consult Dr. H in August 2006.  Dr. H diagnosed him with alcohol dependence and \nrecommended total abstinence. Also, Dr. H recommended a hospital comprehensive \nalcohol treatment services (CATS) program.  Applicant had his last drink of alcohol in \nSeptember 2006 when he voluntarily sought alcohol detoxification at a hospital. He then \nbegan outpatient treatment at the hospital for alcohol dependence in September 2006. \nHe attended some AA meetings. (SOR 1.c.) However, his office travel schedule did not \nallow him to attend aftercare consistently, so he returned to seeing Dr. H on a monthly \nbasis from October 2006 to present. (SOR 1.d.) At the recommendation of Dr. H, \nApplicant and his wife also received psychotherapy from a licensed clinical social \nworker (LCSW) for alcoholism beginning in May 2007 for six months.  Dr. H concluded \nthat the family counseling with Applicant and his wife accomplished its purpose and is \nno longer needed.  (SOR 1.e.) Applicant also completed his counseling with the LCSW. \nApplicant expressed his intention to remain abstinent. Nevertheless, Applicant has \nvoluntarily remained in treatment with Dr. H. This doctor monitors Applicant to ensure \ncompliance with his abstinence and provides support for him to continue his \nabstinence.  (Exhibits 2, 3; Answer; TR 72-76; 86-89; 91-94; Exhibit E)  Applicant has \nattested that since quitting alcohol in September 2006, his life and health have improved \ndramatically.  His compensation at work has gone up to recognize his improved \nperformance.  He is happy with and committed to his sobriety.  (Answer) In sum, \nApplicant has acknowledged his alcoholism, taken actions to overcome this problem, \nand has established a consistent pattern of abstinence for sixteen months.   (Exhibit E)  \n             \nExpert Opinion and Prognosis \n \n            Dr. H was accepted as an expert in alcohol treatment as he has substantial \nexpertise and over 20 years experience in treating patients with alcohol addiction.  As \nindicated previously, his credentials include a M.D. degree; and he is certified in \naddiction medicine.  As an addictionologist, he has a comprehensive approach to \ntreatment. (Exhibit E; TR 97-98)   \n \n            Dr. H established that Applicant now was \u201centirely abstinent from alcohol\u201d and is \ndetermined to remain so.  He confirmed that Applicant voluntarily sought treatment -- \ninitially from April 1998 to April 1999 and again from August 2006 to present.  He \noffered his professional opinion that Applicant\u2019s \u201cprognosis is good because he has fully \naccepted and is comfortable with diagnosis of the disease of addiction to alcohol.\u201d  He \nconfirmed that Applicant continues to \u201cwork his program of recovery.\u201d  He concluded \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nthat Applicant is \u201centirely able to comply with the requirements of a holder of a security \nclearance.\u201d2    \n \n \nReferences \n \n            Applicant\u2019s friend since 2002 is a policy analyst for a state legislature. He and \n Applicant met at an athletic meet, and they became friends.  He only observed \nApplicant intoxicated one time in 2006; subsequently, Applicant told him he consulted a \ndoctor because of his concern over his drinking to excess.  Since that time, he has \nnever seen Applicant drink alcohol.  He considers Applicant reliable, trustworthy, and \nsupportive.  (TR 21-27; 28-34) \n \n            Applicant\u2019s former supervisor, Mr. S, now with a different company, testified on \nhis behalf and recommended him for a security clearance.  He was the manager who \nreviewed Applicant\u2019s software analysis work from 2004 to 2006.  All of the customers \nwere happy with Applicant\u2019s work. This supervisor knows their views as he surveyed \nthem to make sure the employees were delivering quality work.  Also, Applicant \nprovided weekly status reports.  He assessed Applicant\u2019s judgment as being very good; \nand he was very reliable and trustworthy.  Applicant consulted with this manager before \nhe entered the alcohol treatment program.  This supervisor had never seen any \n \n2 Dr. H\u2019s opinion concerning Applicant\u2019s diagnosis and prognosis is admissible because such \ninformation is applicable in AG \u00b6\u00b6 21 and 22. However, his opinion and the opinions of his character \nwitnesses about whether Applicant should have a security clearance receives minimal weight. I have \ncarefully applied the Appeal Board\u2019s instructive comments in ISCR Case No. 03-22167 at 5 (App. Bd. \nDec. 6, 2006) in my conclusions and whole person analysis.  The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-\n22167 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2006) states: \n \nExpert opinion as to witness credibility is generally inadmissible in judicial proceedings \nsubject to the Federal Rules of Evidence. See, for example, United States v. Schaffer, \n523 U.S. 303, 317 (1998); Nimely v. City of New York, 414 F.2d 381, 398 (2d Cir \n2005)(\u201c[E]xpert opinions that constitute evaluations of witness credibility, even when such \nevaluations are rooted in scientific or technical expertise, are inadmissible . . .\u201d); United \nStates v. Solomonson, 908 F2d 358, 362 (8th Cir. 1990); Morris v. Burnett, 319 F3d \n1254, 1276 (10th Cir. 2003). The reason for this rule is that evaluation of witness \ncredibility is the exclusive provenance of the finder of fact. See Nimely at 397. Although \nthe Federal Rules of Evidence do not strictly apply in hearings conducted in accordance \nwith the Directive, they do serve as a guide. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19. Because factual findings \nare the responsibility of the Administrative Judge, we conclude that it was improper for \nher to rely on this aspect of the expert\u2019s testimony. In doing so, she appeared to \nsubstitute the expert\u2019s opinion for her own duty to identify and analyze those facts which \nsupport her credibility determination. This does not mean that the Administrative Judge \nshould discount the expert\u2019s testimony in toto, insofar as the expert did testify as to his \npersonal observations of Applicant\u2019s demeanor. Nor does it mean that an expert is \nprecluded from testifying as to his or her opinion as to a witness\u2019s character for \ntruthfulness. However, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s deferral to the expert witness on the \nissue of Applicant\u2019s credibility with respect to the arrests was arbitrary, capricious, and \ncontrary to law. In totality, the record does not contain sufficient credible evidence to \npermit the Judge to make a finding of fact supporting Applicant\u2019s credibility that satisfies \nthe substantial evidence test. See ISCR Case No. 02-02892 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 28, \n2004).  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nindications of an alcohol abuse issue at work and had never even seen Applicant take a \ndrink.  Mr. S continues to view Applicant as a friend and has continued to see him since \nhe moved to a different company.  (TR 35-44; 45-51) \n \n            Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, who herself has had a top secret clearance, testified \non his behalf.  She sees him a couple of times a month and on special occasions. In the \n14 years she has known him, she has seen him drink alcoholic beverages but never \nseen him intoxicated.  He has been \u201ca little tipsy\u201d on a handful of occasions and did not \ndrive in that condition.  She assessed Applicant as a reliable person with good judgment \nand recommended him for a security clearance.  (TR 53-58; 58-59)  She has never \nseen him drink alcohol since September 2006.  (TR 58-60) \n \n            His supervisor for ten months, Mr. W, who has known Applicant for three years, \npraised Applicant\u2019s \u201csincerity, integrity, and his innate sensitivity\u201d to company proprietary \nand government classified information.  While he observed some problem with \nabsences which he later learned were related to Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption, he \nhad no indication of an alcohol issue while Applicant was under his supervision.  \n(Exhibit A) \n \n            The father of one of Applicant\u2019s high school friends who has know Applicant \nsince 1984 assessed him as \u201ca very responsible and loyal citizen\u201d who should be \nentrusted with classified information.  He never observed Applicant abuse alcohol.  \n (Exhibit B) \n \n            A family friend who has known Applicant\u2019s father since their joint military service \nin 1962 praised Applicant\u2019s integrity, honesty and level of intelligence.  He views \nApplicant as \u201ca responsible human being whose honesty, integrity, diligent work habits \nand moral character are above reproach.\u201d  He observed Applicant in 2007 when he did \nnot drink any alcohol.  Having experience in the intelligence community, he assessed \nApplicant as someone who should be permitted to retain his security clearance.   \n(Exhibit C) \n \n            Mr. B, the president of a company, has known Applicant since 2001 when he \n was hired to work on a project with Mr. B.  He worked with him on a daily basis from \n2001 to 2003.   He described Applicant in that period as having a professional approach \nto technical aspects of the project as well as in his dealings with the people involved.  \nHe maintains contact with him several times a year.  He recommends he be able to \nmaintain his clearance.  (Exhibit D) \n \n            His brother-in-law who has known Applicant for more than a decade was aware \nof Applicant\u2019s struggle with alcoholism.  However, Applicant\u2019s \u201cchallenges with alcohol \nnever interfered with his dedication to his family and his professionalism.\u201d He respected \nApplicant\u2019s willingness to recognize the \u201cproblem independently\u201d and to deal with it \n\u201cproactively.\u201d  He recommended him for a security clearance.  (Exhibit E) \n \n            A friend of Applicant\u2019s since 1984 (which has continued from high school, to \ncollege, to their adult lives) evaluates Applicant as a person of integrity and fidelity who \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nhas a strong work ethic.  He confirmed that Applicant had been abstinent for 18 \nmonths.  He recommended him for a security clearance.  (Exhibit F) \n \nPolicies \n \n            As set forth in the regulation, every recommended personnel security decision \nmust be a fair and impartial overall common sense decision based on all available \nevidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The decision must be arrived at by applying \nthe standard that the grant or continuance of a security clearance or access to classified \ninformation is clearly within the interests of national security.  \n \n            The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed the adjudicative process is a \ncareful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It \nrecognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, \nmotivations and various other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, \ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, \nmature thinking, and careful analysis. \n \n            In all adjudications, national security is the paramount consideration. Any doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information must be \nresolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \n            In the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3[1] demonstrating that it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Appellant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Appellant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.  Ultimately, Appellant has the burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n            AG \u00b6 21 raises the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption stating, \n \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \n \n3\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of \ndrawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being \nsupported by substantial evidence. Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. \nArea Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  \n[1]  \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d  Seven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions may raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) - 22(g) provide:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and, \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \nAG \u00b6 22(a) applies as Appellant was found guilty of one DUI in 1993. AG \u00b6 22(b) \napplies because alcohol use led to excessive absences from work, and eventually he \nwas terminated from his position due to the absences.  AG \u00b6 22(c) applies as he \nengaged in habitual moderate to binge drinking from 2000 to 2006.  AG \u00b6 22(d) applies \nbecause a physician diagnosed him as alcohol dependent. AG \u00b6 22(e) does not apply \nbecause the Licensed Clinical Social Worker did not provide a diagnosis, however, if \none were solicited she would have provided a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.  AG \u00b6 \n22(f) applies because he had a relapse after completing treatment with Dr. H in 1999. \nAG \u00b6 does not apply because he did not violate any court orders.   \n          All four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d) \npotentially apply to mitigate the Aggravating Conditions listed above:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and, \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n  \nTo his credit Applicant voluntarily sought treatment from 1998 to 1999.  However, \nhe began to drink again in 2000 and continued to drink to excess until September 2006.  \nAgain, he voluntarily sought and completed his treatment program in 2006.  Indeed, he \nnow has sixteen months of abstinence from alcohol.  The expert addictionologist, an \nM.D., reported that Applicant voluntarily sought help both in 1998-1999 and again from \n2006 to present.  He diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent [AG \u00b6 22(d)].  Applicant \nhas chosen not to drink and drive since he completed the September 2006 treatment \nprogram as he subsequently chose abstinence. After successfully completing the \ntreatment program, he has chosen to continue to receive treatment for his alcoholism.  \nClearly, all mitigating conditions except for AG \u00b6 22(c) apply.  AG \u00b6 22(c) does not apply \nbecause Applicant has a \u201cprevious treatment and relapse,\u201d although as indicated \npreviously he is making satisfactory progress. \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s expert gave him a favorable prognosis and highly \ncommended Applicant\u2019s commitment to sobriety.  Applicant\u2019s supervisors never saw \nany indications of alcohol abuse at work and attested to his trustworthiness and \nreliability.  His supervisors praise the quality of his work. To his credit Applicant \nvoluntarily addressed his alcohol issues.  For over fifteen years he has not driven after \nconsuming alcohol.  He has not had any alcohol-related incidents whatsoever since July \n1992, over fifteen years ago. He has demonstrated he has significantly changed his \nconsumption of alcohol and now has a commitment to sobriety and abstinence for over \nsixteen months. Because of his extensive efforts at rehabilitation, his alcoholism \u201cdoes \nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22 (a). \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nWhole Person \n \n            I considered the specific factors listed in AG \u00b6 2: \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence\u201d of the conduct at issue.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s 1992 DUI (15 years ago) was a misdemeanor. This is the sole \ncriminal offense resulting from his alcoholism. He also lost a job because of alcohol \nabuse. He received treatment in 1999 and then had a relapse, as he continued to \nconsume alcohol, occasionally to excess. \n \nIn 2006, Applicant acknowledged his problem with alcohol and voluntarily sought \ntreatment which he is still continuing.  Although he successfully completed his treatment \nprogram, he continues to attend treatment in order to reinforce sobriety. He has \nalleviated the circumstances or factors to reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress with respect to committing DUIs and other alcohol-\nrelated problems. He has completely abstained from alcohol consumption. He provided \na solid presentation of his character and loyalty in the endorsements of his supervisors \nand other family friends and relatives who have known him over a substantial period of \ntime. With his ongoing support from his treating physician, it is very unlikely he will have \nanother DUI or lose his abstinence. He focused his efforts and made substantial \nprogress on correction of his alcohol abuse. Having reviewed the guidelines and \nassessed him as a \u201cwhole person\u201d in order to evaluate Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability \nin protecting our national interests, I find Appellant has mitigated all security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:             FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.e.                  For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n            In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the \nApplicant.  Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nKATHRYN MOEN BRAEMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Finding no error,\n2\nwe affirm.\nThe Judge made the following sustainable findings: In 1999, Applicant pleaded guilty to a\ncharge of tampering with evidence, and paid a fine and court cost of approximately $300.  In 1999,\nhe was found guilty of possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia and fined $500.  In 2005 a\nbench warrant for Applicant\u2019s arrest was issued due to his failure to pay that $500 fine.  In 2006,\nApplicant falsified a Questionnaire for National Security Positions when he stated that he had used\nmarijuana once in August of 1999, when he had in fact used marijuana on a weekly basis from 1993\nto 2001 and on a monthly basis from 2001 to 2002.\n    \n The Board has examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole and concludes\nthat the Judge has drawn \u201ca rational connection between the facts found\u201d under Guidelines J and E\nand his adverse decision.

During the period of his marijuana abused, Applicant\npurchased the illegal substance about 100 times, spending \u201c$20.00 per occasion\u201d (Id).\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\n3.a.  In answering \u201cSection 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity\u201d on\nhis July 11, 2006 e-QIP, the Applicant disclosed only a one time use of marijuana in\nAugust of 1999 (GX 4 at pages 29~30).  The Applicant gives no explanation for this\nobvious falsehood.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all\n\n3\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG Paragraph 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG Subparagraph 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses@ is\npotentially disqualifying.  Similarly under AG Subparagraph 31(c), \u201callegations or\nadmissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\nprosecuted or convicted\u201d may raise security concerns.  I can find no countervailing\nmitigating conditions that are applicable in Applicant\u2019s case.  Although his last conviction\nwas in November of 1999; from all appearances, he still has an outstanding warrant for\n\n4\nhis arrest, as he has yet to pay a $500 fine as a result of his prior August 1999\nconviction for drug possession.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG Paragraph 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe guideline also notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.\nUnder AG Subparagraph 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse\u201d may be disqualifying.  As is the\n\u201cpurchase\u201d of illegal drugs under Subparagraph 25(c).  Here the Applicant used\nmarijuana fairly extensively for nearly ten years from September of 1993 to December\nof 2002.  This is countered, however, by the mitigating condition found in Subparagraph\n26(a).  The Applicant\u2019s Drug Involvement \u201chappened so long ago [more than five years\nago] . . . that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG Paragraph 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG Subparagraph 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations . . .\u201d  Here, the Applicant falsified his e-QIP as it concerns his past Drug\nInvolvement.  In answer to the SOR, he gives no explanation for this clear falsification.  I\ncan find no countervailing mitigating conditions that are applicable.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG Subparagraph 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\n\n5\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nHere, the Applicant was clearly less than candid with the Government regarding\nhis past drug abuse.  Furthermore, he has an outstanding warrant for his arrest.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, Although I find\nfor the Applicant as to his past Drug Involvement, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated\nthe security concerns arising from his Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n_________________\nRICHARD A. CEFOLA\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts she failed to disclose in a security clearance\napplication she submitted. Clearance is denied.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\n\n2\nadministrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations),\nGuideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant submitted an undated\nresponse to the SOR that was notarized on August 27, 2007. She admitted all allegations contained\nin the SOR except subparagraphs 1.a-1.f, 1.h-1i, 1.l-1.p, 1.v, 1.x-1.z, 1.bb-1.ee, 1.gg, 1.ii, 1.mm-\n1.oo, 1.qq-1.tt, 1.vv-1.ww, 1.aaa-1.ccc, and 3.a-3.c, which she denied, and subparagraph 1.ddd,\nwhich she did not respond to at all. Applicant requested a clearance decision based on the written\nrecord without a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 5, 2007,\nthat was mailed to Applicant that same date. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on\nSeptember 17, 2007, and did not submit an objection or response to the FORM within the 30-day\ntime period provided to her. The case was assigned to me on November 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s partial admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 38 years old, has two children, ages nine and six, and has been married since\nMay 1997. She attended college from August 1990 until May 1993. The FORM does not indicate\nwhether she received a degree. She has been employed as a photo imaging specialist by a defense\ncontractor since February 2002. She was employed in a similar capacity by a different defense\ncontractor from January 1994 until February 2002. The FORM indicates she has held a secret\nsecurity clearance since approximately May 1997, and there is no indication any prior action has\nbeen initiated to revoke, suspend, or downgrade that clearance.\nThe SOR alleges 55 debts totaling well over $30,000.00 that have been submitted for\ncollection, charged off, were past due, and/or resulted in liens or judgments being entered against\nApplicant. While she denies most of the debts without explanation, and submitted some evidence\nthat several debts have been paid (those alleged in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d and 1.e), Applicant\nadmitted in her response to the SOR her liability for 20 debts, totaling more than $20,000.00. \nThe accounts Applicant admits to include such items as numerous bad checks written for\nsuch items as pizzas, an automobile repossession, and multiple revolving charge accounts. Applicant\nprovided no explanation for why she accumulated so many delinquent debts, no plan to resolve any\nof the admitted delinquent debts, and no reason to expect she will display financial responsibility in\nthe future. \nApplicant admits, as alleged in the SOR, to being arrested and charged with passing bogus\nchecks in July 1993 and December 2003. She admitted in the security clearance application\ncontained in the FORM that she paid a fine and made restitution for a bogus check charge in\nNovember 2004. There is no information in the FORM to indicate this charge is or is not related to\neither of the charges alleged in the FORM.  \n  \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application November 2006, in which she answered\n\u201cNo\u201d to questions asking if she had any property repossessed within the previous seven years, had\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n3\nany liens placed against her property with the last seven years, had any judgments entered against\nher in the last seven years, was currently more than 90 days delinquent on any debts, and if she had\nbeen more than 180 days delinquent on any debts in the preceding seven years. All of those answers\nwere false. Applicant admitted in her response to the SOR that at the time she submitted the security\nclearance application she \u201cthen knew and sought to conceal\u201d that she was currently more than 90\ndays delinquent on any debts, and she had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts in the\npreceding seven years. \nApplicant stated in her response to the SOR that she voluntarily returned the vehicle that was\nalleged to having been repossessed and was unaware of the lien as explanations for her inaccurate\nresponses to the security clearance questions asking about those events. She did not provide any\nexplanation as to why she answered no in response to the security clearance application question\nasking about judgments being entered against her and then denied the SOR allegation relating\nthereto.   \n \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be\na fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the\nDirective. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline\nF, pertaining to financial considerations, Guideline J, pertaining to criminal conduct, and Guideline\nE, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective disqualifying and mitigating conditions, are\nmost relevant in this case.   \nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government has\n2\nthe burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\n3\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence , although the government is required to present\n4\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\n5\n\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nless than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden\n6\nshifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the\ncase against her.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n7\nfavorable clearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n9\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d   Any reasonable\n10\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts.\nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\nAs alleged in the SOR and evidenced by Applicant\u2019s credit reports, Applicant allowed\nnumerous accounts, totaling more than $30,000.00, to become past due, charged off as bad debts,\nsubmitted for collection, and/or result in liens and judgments being filed against her. All but three\naccounts remain unsatisfied. Disqualifying Conditions 19(a): Inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts and 19(c): A history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nThere is no evidence in the FORM to support the allegation alleged in subparagraph 1.ddd.\nApplicant submitted evidence to support finding she has paid the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a,\n1.d and 1.e. However, she submitted no evidence other than her unexplained denials to indicate any\npayments have been made on any of the other listed accounts, that any of the accounts are not\nproperly alleged in the SOR, that she has made any effort to resolve any of those accounts, or that\nshe has any plan to resolve any of the accounts. Accordingly, I have considered all Guideline F\nmitigating conditions and none apply.\n\n5\nCriminal conduct under Guideline J is a security concern because criminal conduct creates\ndoubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, criminal\nconduct calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.\nApplicant was charged with bogus checks in 1993 and 2003. The FORM does not provide\nany further information about the 1993 charge. The SOR allegation to which Applicant admitted\nalleges Applicant pled not guilty to that charge and it was dismissed. While Applicant admitted in\nthe security clearance application she submitted that she was fined and required to pay restitution\nfor a bogus check charge in 2004, there is no evidence sufficient to connect that admission to either\nof the SOR allegations. As a result, there  is insufficient evidence in the FORM to establish that the\ntwo charges alleged create a security clearance concern. \nApplicant admits she deliberately provided false information in response to two questions\nasking about her financial status when she submitted a security clearance application in November\n2006. As discussed below, I also find she deliberately provided false information in response to a\nthird question asking about her financial status in that application. The false answers she gave in the\nsecurity clearance application constitute an offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Disqualifying conditions\n31(a): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; 31(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted\napply in this case. I have considered all mitigating conditions under Guideline J and none apply. \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central\nquestion if a person\u2019s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified information. \nApplicant admitted to deliberately providing false answers to questions inquiring about debts\nthat were more than 90 and 180 days delinquent in the security clearance application she submitted.\nAlthough she denied she deliberately provided a false answer to the question inquiring about\njudgments, she failed to provide any explanation for why she answered the question as she did.\nConsidering the sheer number of judgments entered against her, that unexplained denial is not\nbelievable. However, her explanations for answering the questions concerning repossessions and\nliens do adequately explain her reasons for answering those questions incorrectly.\nDisqualifying condition 16(a):  deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies. I have\nconsidered all mitigating conditions under Guideline E, and none apply.\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Having done so, I conclude that\nApplicant has failed to present sufficient evidence of refutation, extenuation, and mitigation to\novercome the case against her. Accordingly, Guideline F, Guideline J and Guideline E are decided\nagainst Applicant.  \n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a, d & e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs b & c\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs f-ccc:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ddd:\nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2-Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a & b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a & b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs c - e:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 59-year-old contracts administrator employed by a federal contractor.  He has\nhad delinquent debts since 2002.  Even though his wife had cancer surgery, and has been unable to\nwork, he made no real effort to resolve his indebtedness until 2007.  The documentation he provided\nwas insufficient to mitigate the security concerns about his financial considerations.  He gave a false\nanswer on two security clearance applications involving a judgment, and even though he had two\nsubsequent interviews with investigators, he did not disclose the judgment to the government.  His\nfinancial problems and deliberate omission are aggravated by the fact that he has been a facility\nsecurity officer (FSO) for over two years.  He also has held a security clearance since 1988.  He\nfailed to mitigate the security concern about personal conduct.

The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 11, 2006, detailing\nthe basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative\nguidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.\nPending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all\ncases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 10, 2007, and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of\nthe government\u2019s case, a copy of which was received by Applicant on July 1, 2007.  Applicant was\nafforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation by July 31, 2007.  He filed a response which was received by DOHA on August 2, 2007.\nThe case was assigned to me on September 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., and 1.f.\nHe denied all other allegations in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of\nfact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 59-year-old contracts administrator employed by a federal contractor.   He has\n2\nbeen employed with this company since 1976, and since March 2005, has served as the facility\nsecurity officer.   He is married with no children.   He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in building\n3\n4\nconstruction.  He served in the United States Army from September 1969 to June 1972, and attained\nthe rank of Sergeant (E-5).  He was granted a security clearance in 1988.5\n\nItem 6 (Credit Report, dated November 15, 2006) at 1-4.\n6\nItem 7 (Credit Report, dated June 21, 2006) at 3; Item \n7\nResponse to the FORM, dated July 22, 2007, at 7.\n8\nItem 2 (Answer to SOR, dated January 10, 2007) at 1-9.\n9\nId. at 9.\n10\nId. at 1-9.\n11\nItem 3, supra, note 1, at 4.\n12\nItem 2, supra, note 8, at 5.\n13\nItem 9 (Personal Subject Interview, dated July 6, 2005) at 1-3.\n14\nItem 3, supra, note 1, at 4-5.\n15\n4\nApplicant had eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $79,567.   In his answer to the\n6\nSOR, he provided evidence that a debt of $26 listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d., and a judgement for\n$1,361 listed in subparagraph 1.h. were satisfied.  He did not provide evidence of payments or\npayment arrangements with respect to the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.f.  Subparagraph\n1.e. is an amount in excess of $36,000, of which at least $4,000 is delinquent, and he provided  no\n7\nevidence of payments.  Applicant provided evidence of one payment on debts alleged in\nsubparagraphs 1.b. and 1.g.  As to the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.c., he provided evidence of\nthree payments on his mortgage, and that foreclosure proceedings were held in abeyance by the\ncreditor.   He also stated that his wife underwent surgery in late 2003.  There is no evidence to show\n8\nhow much work Applicant or his wife missed during her recuperation.   She is now disabled an\n9\nunable to work, although there is no doctor\u2019s.  Applicant does not say whether she has applied for\nand is/is not receiving social security disability.  He was interviewed by Defense Security Services\n(DSS) in January or February 2005, to review an unfavorable financial credit report.   Most efforts\n10\nat debt reduction occurred in 2007.11\nApplicant first submitted his security clearance application on October 7, 2003.  He\nsubsequently re-signed and re-submitted a security clearance on March 8, 2005.  On both\nsubmissions, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 37, which asks whether any judgment had been filed\nagainst him in the last seven years.   He omitted the judgment listed in SOR subparagraph 1.h.\n12\nApplicant admitted that a judgment was filed against him in May 2003, but that he only became\naware of it in the second week of October 2003.  He stated that his wife who received the notice of\nthe judgment but did not tell him about it to \u201cspare me the stress of another creditor demand.\u201d13\nEven though he knew about the 1.h. judgment since October 2003, he did not disclose the judgment\nin his July 205 security interview, even though he specifically discussed his other financial\ndifficulties including medical expenses and delinquencies.   He even amended his earlier answers\n14\nto questions 38 and 39 on his March 2005 SF 86 submission, but failed to disclose the 1.h.\njudgment.15\nPOLICIES\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n16\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n5\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nconsiders all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n16\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n17\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decides whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n18\n6\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.17\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.18\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems.  \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d \nThe government established its case under Guideline \u00b6 19.  Two Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying\nin this case: Guideline \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and Guideline \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  Applicant has a history of not meeting debts, as set\nforth in the SOR and government exhibits.  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e)\nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\n7\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which\nis the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guidelines \u00b6 20(a) and\n(e) do not apply.  The debts continued to be delinquent until recently and  there is no basis to dispute\nmost of the indebtedness.  However, Guidelines \u00b6 20 (b), (c), and (d) are at issue.  Applicant did not\nseek financial counseling.  His efforts at debt reduction only became serious in 2007.  He was on\nnotice in early 2005 that the government had concerns about his financial situation.  He did pay off\nthe $1,361 judgment (1.h.) and a $26 phone bill (1.d..)  But there is still over $60,000 of debt, and\nthere is insufficient evidence of payments made to know where Applicant stands in terms of his\noverall debt repayment.  His wife had cancer surgery and is disabled, although there is no doctor\u2019s\nstatement or other documentation to verify the impact on their finances.  I cannot make an\naffirmative finding that he has his finances under control.  What is required is documentary proof\nof payments - a cancelled check (both sides), a creditor\u2019s statement, a money order, or a doctor\u2019s\nstatement, etc.  While I do not cast aspersions on Applicant\u2019s truthfulness, his saying so isn\u2019t the best\nevidence.  His statements must be supported by documents.  The mitigating condition under\nGuideline \u00b6 20 (b) is not totally applicable.  There is insufficient proof of serious debt reduction to\nconclude that Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve the debts.  Therefore Guideline \u00b6 20 (b), (c), and (d) do not apply.  I conclude Guideline F\nagainst Applicant.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nUnder Guideline \u00b6 15, \u201cconduct involving...lack of candor [or] dishonesty...can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process.\u201d  One personal conduct disqualifying condition is particularly relevant\nand may be disqualifying in this case.  \nGuideline \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n\n8\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an\nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative.\nApplicant\u2019s furnished incorrect answers to question 37 on his two security clearance\napplications in 2003 and 2005.  However, Applicant denied that he intentionally falsified the answers\nby not listing this judgment.  Applicant knew he had a judgment against him.  He had an interview\nwith DSS agents twice, and knew they were concerned about his financial delinquencies.  Yet he did\nnot disclose the judgment to the government.  The government established its case under Guideline\n\u00b6 16 (a) and (b).\nGuideline \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising\nor instructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and\ntruthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or\nit happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; or\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\nGuideline \u00b6 17 (a-c) does not apply.  Applicant did not make a timely or voluntary disclosure\nof his judgment.  A false answer on a security clearance application is not a \u201cminor\u201d matter.\nTruthfulness is at the heart of the security clearance process.  There is no evidence to support (b) or\n(c).  As none of these conditions apply,  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.\n \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Guideline \u00b6 2(a).\nApplicant has made little progress resolving his debts.  He is 59 years old, sufficiently mature to be\nfully responsible for his obligations.\nI considered his age, his education, his employment, and factors that might motivate him to\nbe less than truthful.  Applicant supplied false answers on a security clearance applications.  This\nis problematic because candor with the government about a person\u2019s negatives is the crux of a\ntrustworthiness determination.  If a person discloses the adverse information about himself, then he\nmay be trusted with classified information.  Applicant admitted to financial problems spanning from\n\n9\n2002 until the present.  He has resolved two of the debts.  The remaining delinquent debts total over\n$60,000.  His falsification constitutes very serious misconduct, which is an aggravating factor, given\nhis duties and experience as a facility security officer.\nApplicant\u2019s wife suffered medical problems, which caused a reduction in household income\nand an increase in household expenses.  However, he provided no documentation to corroborate his\nclaims.  Further, the circumstances did not contribute to the falsification issue.  The financial\ndifficulties are ongoing.  There is no record evidence to suggest that Applicant did not voluntarily\nincur these debts and commit the falsification.  His failure to significantly and responsibly address\nhis delinquent debts for several years is an aggravating factor.  He knew over 2 \u00bd years ago that the\ngovernment was focused on his financial delinquencies.  Yet he waited until the current year to the\nattempt to make any debt resolution.  There is no evidence of his motivation which would operate\nto mitigate his conduct.\nThe United States has a duty to protect itself from unauthorized disclosures of sensitive\ninformation and place the utmost trust in those persons to whom it grant access to sensitive\ninformation.  The totality of the record raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's\nability to protect classified information, and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion\nexpected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 56, married and has an advanced degree. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Linguist and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Applicant has two debts that are seriously past due. 1.a. The Applicant was hospitalized in August 2003 due to heart problems related to high blood pressure. He went to two hospitals and some procedures were done. At that time the Applicant was separated from his wife, living in a different state, and unable to practice his profession. He was working as a security guard and not making a lot of money. Accordingly, he could not pay the bills in full as they came due. The Applicant testified that he paid a little on each bill every month, from $5.00 to $50.00. He accepts the fact that as of the day of the hearing he still owes money on his medical bills, but he is disputing the amount he is alleged to owe. (Transcript at 84-95.) The three credit reports in the record indicate that the Applicant owes approximately $21,000.00 in past due medical debts. (Government Exhibits 2, 3 and 5.) The Applicant also submitted documentation from the current creditor/collection agency, which alleges the same debt. (Government Exhibit 4 at 14-15.) The Applicant disputes this amount. He believes the debt for his hospitalization should be in the neighborhood of $2,100. He submitted records showing that he contacted the collection agency by mail in August 20",

On September 25, 2007, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on October 17, 2007, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on November 27, 2007.  I received the case assignment on December 3, 2007.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 15, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on February 21, 2008. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\n\n2\nthrough 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\ncalled one additional witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C, without\nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February 29, 2008,\nto submit additional matters.  On February 27, 2008, he submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D,\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on February 29, 2008.\nThe record closed on February 29, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 56, married and has an advanced degree.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor as a Linguist and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection\nwith his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant has two debts that are seriously past due.  \n1.a.\nThe Applicant was hospitalized in August 2003 due to heart problems\nrelated to high blood pressure.  He went to two hospitals and some procedures were\ndone.  At that time the Applicant was separated from his wife, living in a different state,\nand unable to practice his profession.  He was working as a security guard and not\nmaking a lot of money.  Accordingly, he could not pay the bills in full as they came due.\nThe Applicant testified that he paid a little on each bill every month, from $5.00 to\n$50.00.  He accepts the fact that as of the day of the hearing he still owes money on his\nmedical bills, but he is disputing the amount he is alleged to owe.  (Transcript at 84-95.)\nThe three credit reports in the record indicate that the Applicant owes\napproximately $21,000.00 in past due medical debts.  (Government Exhibits 2, 3 and 5.)\nThe Applicant also submitted documentation from the current creditor/collection agency,\nwhich alleges the same debt.  (Government Exhibit 4 at 14-15.)  The Applicant disputes\nthis amount.  He believes the debt for his hospitalization should be in the neighborhood\nof $2,100.  He submitted records showing that he contacted the collection agency by\nmail in August 2007, and telephone in October 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  He\ntestified that he had not had any further contacts and, as of the day of the hearing, he\nhad received no response from them.  (Transcript at 111-112.)  The Applicant\nrepeatedly stated that he would pay for his just medical bills, but that he did not think he\nreceived $21,000.00 worth of medical care.  (Transcript at 117-122.)  After the hearing\nwas concluded, the Applicant filed a dispute with the credit reporting services\nconcerning this debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)\nThe Applicant submitted copies of his medical bills to DOHA in his Interrogatories\n(Government Exhibit 4.)  These documents indicate that the Applicant was receiving\nbills from two hospitals, an ambulance service, and various medical providers.  The\nApplicant submitted documentation from one hospital that his Financial Hardship\n\n3\nApplication was granted at 100% of his billing.  (Government Exhibit 4 at 6, Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A.)  He also submitted billing statements from a doctor and an ambulance\ncompany showing that they were accepting his small monthly payments for several\nyears on his accounts through August 2007.  From the available records, the Applicant\nhas paid each of these creditors about half of their bill.  (Government Exhibit 4 at 23-\n31.)  These two debts are the only ones that were being paid after 2005.  From July\n2005 through September 2007, the Applicant was serving overseas with the United\nStates Armed Forces in support of the Global War on Terror.  His wife paid these bills\nduring his absence.  (Transcript at 87, 99, 123-124.)  At the hearing, neither the\nApplicant or his wife were able to say when the last payment was made to any of his\ncreditors.  (Transcript at 60-61.) \nUsing the original bills that the Applicant submitted in Government Exhibit 4, a\ntotal original amount of at least $6,764.75 is found owing.  This does not include the bill\nfrom the hospital which forgave the Applicant\u2019s debt.  The Applicant\u2019s records also show\ntotal payments of $1,405.00.  Therefore, by the Applicant\u2019s own figures, he still owes at\nleast $5,359.75 in medical bills.  Of that amount, $1,183.75 is owed to the doctor and\nambulance company, who have been accepting the Applicant\u2019s payments.  This means\nthe Applicant owes at least $4,176.00 in medical bills that he is not currently paying, and\nindicates that he will not pay until he receives what he finds to be a correct and current\nbilling.\n1.b.\nThe Applicant and his wife used an accountant to prepare their joint tax\nreturn.  His normal charge for this was $225.00 a year.  They separated in 2000.  The\naccountant prepared tax returns for each of them that year and charged each of them\n$465.00.  The Applicant paid $232.00 on this account on May 22, 2001, and protested\nto the accountant about what he felt was the excessive price.  The Applicant\u2019s wife also\nsubmitted a check for $232.50.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, Transcript at 32-40.)  The\nApplicant feels that he has a legitimate dispute with this accountant and refuses to pay\nanything more on this bill.  (Transcript at 122.)  After the hearing was concluded, the\nApplicant filed a dispute with the credit reporting services concerning this debt.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n\n4\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n5\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns. Based on the state of this record, I am unable to determine the total\npast due indebtedness of the Applicant regarding subparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant has\nat least $4,176.00 in past due medical bills, which have been due and owing for several\nyears. This does not include the two medical debts that the Applicant has been paying\nover the years.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose in 2003.  However, he still owes a considerable amount of\ndebt as of the date of the hearing, no matter whose figures are used.  This mitigating\ncondition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment . . . unexpected medical emergency, . . . separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  The Applicant was laid\noff from his job.  He and his wife separated and he had to move to another state, where\nhe was underemployed and hospitalized.  For a period of time he made small payments\non his medical debts.  He disputes the amount he owes for some of the debts.\nHowever, he has not acted responsibly or in a timely manner.  He has not contacted the\ncollection agency since last year, and it was only after the hearing that he filed a dispute\nwith the credit reporting agencies Even taking into consideration his service overseas\nfrom 2005 through 2007, I cannot find, under these particular circumstances, that the\nApplicant has acted responsibly.\nThe Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off some of his creditors.\nConsequently, AG \u00b6 20(d) is arguably applicable.  As stated earlier, based on the state\nof this record, I cannot determine with any kind of certainty how much the Applicant\ncurrently owes in past due medical debts.  Given that fact, I cannot find that there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control, as required by\nAG \u00b6 20(c).\nAG \u00b6 20(e) states that it may be mitigating where the individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\n\n6\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  The Applicant has filed disputes about both\nallegations with the credit reporting firms.  However, based on the state of the record, I\ncan find that only the one with regards to the accountant is legitimate at this time.\nTherefore, subparagraph 1.b. is found for the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nprofessional person who has had some tough times.  However, by his own admission,\nthe Applicant is nowhere near being able to pay off even the medical debt he admits he\nowes in any reasonable period of time.\nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all the Applicant\u2019s debts are paid - it is\nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security\nclearance.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), this conduct is recent.  Given the state of the record, I\nam not convinced that the Applicant has a good grasp of his actual debt situation.  Nor\nhas he been diligent in figuring these figures out.  Accordingly, I cannot find that there\nhave been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Therefore, at the\npresent time, I cannot find that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)8)), or that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil\n(AG \u00b62(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  If the Applicant can plainly and clearly resolve the questions\nsurrounding his total indebtedness, and how he intends to resolve it, he may be eligible\nfor a security clearance in the future.  He is not eligible now.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\n\n7\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H.

On September 28, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 11, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge David M. White denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guidelines F and B is sustainable.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guideline F should be reversed\nbecause the Judge did not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed\nthat as to his four delinquent debts, he had paid off one, made small payments on two others, and\nwas still negotiating as to the other.  Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision under\nGuideline B should be reversed because his Nigerian family members do not make him vulnerable\nto coercion, exploitation, or pressure. \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nAs to the Guideline F allegations, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision,\nApplicant still owed significant amounts on his delinquent debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge\ncould reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-23894 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 2008).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered\nthe possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  He found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to one\nof the SOR allegations.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the government\u2019s security concerns.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  Given the record that was before him, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\n\n3\nBecause the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable, the Board\nneed not address the issues raised by Applicant under Guideline B.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 15,\n2005. On September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 5, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on October 26, 2007, and requested that his case be adjudicated\nwithout a hearing. In November, Applicant was notified in writing that, pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.8, Department Counsel requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 29, 2007, and the\ncase was assigned to me on December 11, 2007. \nMarch 11, 2008\n\n2\nPursuant to initial agreement by the parties, DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJanuary 8, 2008, scheduling the hearing for January 24, 2008. On January 10, 2008,\nafter receipt of the Government\u2019s documentary discovery, Applicant requested a\ncontinuance for further preparation. Department Counsel did not object. After the parties\nagreed to a new hearing date, an Amended Notice of Hearing was issued on January\n17, 2008, and I convened the hearing as rescheduled on February 7, 2008. The\ngovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted exhibits (AE) A through F, which\nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nFebruary 19, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel submitted a request for administrative notice, of certain\nfacts concerning Nigeria, that was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Department\nCounsel submitted five U.S. Government source documents in support of this request,\nwhich were admitted for purposes of administrative notice, and marked Administrative\nNotice (AN) exhibits I through V. (Tr. at 27-28.) Applicant introduced the Nigeria chapter\nfrom the CIA World Fact Book (AE A), to further describe current conditions in Nigeria.\nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s exhibit list was marked HE II. Department Counsel also\noffered an Equifax training brochure, not previously provided to Applicant, into evidence.\nUpon objection by Applicant, Department Counsel withdrew the offered exhibit. It was\nmarked HE III and attached to ensure a complete record, but not otherwise considered.\n(Tr. at 42-47.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 26, 2007, (hereinafter \u201cAnswer\u201d)\nApplicant denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 2.b, and 2.c, with\nexplanations. He admitted the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.d, and 2.e. Applicant\u2019s admissions\nand explanations are incorporated in the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 53-year-old senior system engineer for a defense contractor. He\nwas born in Nigeria, came to the U.S. in 1976 as a student, and became a naturalized\nU.S. citizen in 1986. His Nigerian passport expired in 1986, and was officially cancelled.\n(Tr. at 120-121.) He mistakenly reported that he is a dual citizen on his SF 86, and\nconsiders himself solely a U.S. citizen. (Tr. at 95-96.)\nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. His 55-year-old sister is a citizen of Nigeria\nand resides there with her husband and family. (GE 1 at 32, 35; Answer at 2.) She is\nretired and lives comfortably, supported by her family in their ancestral home, located\nabout 100 miles from the Niger Delta area of Port Harcourt. She receives no form of\nassistance from the government. (Tr. at 93-95, 136-137.) Applicant has not visited\n\n3\nNigeria just to see her, but she visited him when he was there for other purposes in\n2001, 2005, 2006, and 2007. His visits there were purely private and social visits, and\nhe had no contact with representatives of the Nigerian government or other foreign\ninterests.\nApplicant married a U.S. citizen in 1979, while he was in the U.S. as a student.\nThey were divorced just over a year later. In 1981, he entered an arranged marriage\nwith a woman from Nigeria, who moved to the U.S. with him. They were married for\nover 11 years, and had four children, now ages 21 to 25. They divorced in 1993. Four\nmonths later, Applicant married another Nigerian citizen who he met in the U.S. This\nmarriage ended in divorce in November 1996. In June 1997, he married another\nNigerian citizen who he met while she was working at the Nigerian embassy in either\nEngland or France. She also moved to the U.S. to live as a resident alien. They\ndivorced in August 2005. \nApplicant married his current wife in December 2005 in Nigeria. Their son was\nborn in January 2006, in Nigeria, where she remained while waiting to receive her\nspouse visa to move to the U.S. Their son is a dual citizen of Nigeria (by birth) and the\nU.S. (by paternity). Applicant\u2019s wife, now 22 years old, is expecting their second child\nthis month. Her immigrant visa was recently approved, but U.S. embassy personnel\nadvised her not to travel to the U.S. until after the baby is born and can travel. Applicant\nhopes his wife and two children will come to the U.S. within a month or two. In the\nmeantime, they continue to reside in Nigeria\u2019s capital city, Abuja, and he continues to\nprovide them financial support. (GE 1 at 27-31, 33-35; Answer at 2 and Encl. 3; AE B;\nTr. at 94, 98, 112-119, 137-138.)\nFrom February 2001 to June 2004, Applicant suffered a period of involuntary\nunemployment and temporary, low-paying work. (GE 1 at 15-21; AE E; Tr. at 68-69, 76-\n77.) During this time, he was unable to pay all his bills, and incurred some delinquent\ndebts. This coincided with his most recent separation and divorce. He began his\ncurrent, lucrative employment in September 2005, and has substantially reduced his\ndebts. He earns about $97,000 per year with a substantial monthly surplus of income\nover expenses. He has about $9,000 in a company investment plan. (GE 2 at 98; AE D;\nTr. at 66.)\nThe $80 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, arose during his current\nemployment. The bill, for an insurance deductible co-pay, was not delivered due to a\nmail-forwarding mix-up while he was visiting Nigeria. He became aware of the debt\nwhen he received the SOR, and claimed in his Answer that he had paid it in October\n2007. He actually paid the debt in full by check in November 2007. (Answer at 1; AE F\nat 1; Tr. at 79-80, 103-106.)  \nThe $585 mobile phone debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b arose from a contract\nApplicant signed for his former wife\u2019s cell phone. She kept the phone and was supposed\nto pay the bills for service, but did not and the account became delinquent in June 2002.\n(GE 4 at 1-2.) Applicant unsuccessfully tried to get her to pay. He wrote a letter to the\n\n4\ncreditor in November 2007, and another on January 25, 2008, without response. He\nenclosed a $50 check with the second letter, that has not yet been cashed. He said he\nintends to negotiate a settlement with the creditor, and has the means to pay the debt\nonce that is resolved. (AE F at 9, 11-13; Tr. at 81-83, 106-108.)\nThe $2,110 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c originated from the purchase of a\nrefrigerator and freezer, which his former wife kept upon their separation and divorce.\nShe did not pay the remaining debt, as agreed, and the account became delinquent in\nMay 2004. (GE 4 at 2.) Applicant negotiated resolution of this debt with the collection\nagency for a total of $738 in October 2007, but did not pay it off. He sent them a letter in\nNovember 2007 seeking to make payments in installments. After receiving no reply, he\nsent another copy of the letter to them on January 25, 2008, with a check for $50 that\nwas deposited. He says he plans to repay the remaining debt on the most favorable\nterms he can negotiate. (AE F at 2-5; Answer at 1; Tr. at 84-86, 108-109.)\nThe $9,899 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is for a credit card account that became\ndelinquent in October 2003 with a balance of $6,242. (GE 3 at 8, 10; GE 4 at 2.) The\ncollection agency that purchased the account was seeking $10,136 as of November\n2007. (GE 5 at 2.) Applicant acknowledges that this is his debt. He sent a letter to the\ncreditor in November 2007, and another on January 25, 2008, with a check for $100.\nThis check was not negotiated by the creditor, and no further progress in resolving this\ndebt was shown. Applicant expressed willingness to settle this debt for a reasonable\namount, but is waiting for an explanation from the creditor to justify the increased\namount due over the four years the debt has been delinquent. (AE F at 6-8; Answer at\n1; Tr. at 86-92.)\nApplicant submitted seven letters attesting to his good character. He also\nsubmitted his performance evaluations showing that he met or exceeded all\nexpectations during 2006, and met some expectations during 2007. (AE C.) His\ntestimony during the hearing was sincere and credible.\nThe facts set forth in HE I, Department Counsel\u2019s request for administrative\nnotice, are substantiated by the supporting Government documents (AN I through V),\nand are not contradicted by AE A. Those facts are incorporated herein by reference.\nSpecifically material to this determination are the continuing abuse of human rights by\nelements of Nigeria\u2019s government, and lawlessness including kidnaping and other\nviolent crime throughout the country committed by civilians and people in police and\nmilitary uniforms. Ethnic and religious strife is ongoing and occasionally violent.\nContrary to Applicant\u2019s assertion, this lawlessness is not confined to the Niger\nRiver Delta area. (Tr. at 32-33, 35-38, 51.) While conditions are particularly bad in the\nDelta region, the danger exists throughout the country including the capital city of Abuja\nwhere his wife and child reside. (See AN III at 1, AN IV at 1, 2, 6.) Senior Al-Qaida\nleadership has expressed interest publicly in overthrowing the government of Nigeria.\nNigeria is a federal republic that returned to civilian rule in 1999 after being under\nmilitary rule for 28 of its 43 years since independence from Britain. Although not\n\n5\nrequested to do so, I also take administrative notice that relations between Nigeria and\nthe U.S. have continuously improved since 1999, with excellent cooperation on\nimportant foreign policy, peacekeeping and anti-terrorism goals. (AN I at 11-12.) \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat two were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances (Tr. at 123.): \u201c(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe evidence shows that Applicant still owes all or most of the three largest of\nfour delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. One creditor offered to settle his $2,110 debt\nfor a lump-sum payment of $738 in October 2007. He did not accept that offer, however,\nso the full amount, less one $50 payment that was accepted, remains unresolved. On\nJanuary 25, 2008, he sent a $50 check to the creditor claiming $585, and a $100 check\nto the creditor listed in the SOR as claiming $9,899 (a figure that rose to $10,136 by\nNovember 2007). Applicant did pay the $80 medical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but still\nhas more than $12,500 in unresolved delinquent debts. These delinquencies arose in\n2002 through 2004, and remain unresolved even though Applicant began earning more\nthan $95,000 per year in September 2005 and has the assets to resolve them. Security\nconcerns are raised under both AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n7\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and,\n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate the financial security concerns because the history\nof delinquent debt is ongoing, despite a significant improvement in Applicant\u2019s income\nand his apparent present ability to resolve the debts. His expression of willingness to\nresolve the debts at some indefinite point in the future is not corroborated by substantial\naction in that direction, and is insufficient mitigation standing alone. \nPotential concerns over the origin of these debts is mitigated by his involuntary\nloss of gainful employment during a time he was also undergoing separation and\ndivorce. However, these conditions were alleviated more than two years ago, and\nApplicant did not act responsibly to resolve these issues since then. Despite an\napparent financial ability to address these matters, Applicant made only token efforts\nsome four months after he was formally notified of the security implications of his\nconduct. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(b) also does not mitigate concerns arising from his\npresent financial considerations.\nApplicant did not demonstrate either a good-faith effort or clear indications that\nthese debts are being resolved. His last-minute efforts to initiate negotiations with his\ncreditors, offering token payments of less than 2% of the unresolved debt, are\ninsufficient to carry his burden to show mitigation. Nor is there any evidence of\ncounseling. Accordingly, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant\nacknowledged the three remaining debts are his, and showed no documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis for questioning any of the claimed amounts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not\napply, and the final mitigating condition is not relevant because no unexplained\naffluence is of security concern.    \nOn balance, despite his apparent present ability to clear these matters up,\nApplicant presented insufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability and trustworthiness\nsecurity concerns arising from his inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and history\nof not meeting financial obligations.\n  \n \n\n8\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department counsel represented that Applicant\u2019s relatives in Nigeria\nraised security concerns under two of them (Tr. at 126, 130.):\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; [and]\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\nApplicant\u2019s pregnant wife and young son are citizens of, and presently reside in,\nNigeria. They have received permission to travel to the U.S. to join Applicant, but have\nnot yet done so and remain in the capital, Abuja. He provides them financial support\nand visited them as often as he could. His sister is also a resident citizen in Nigeria, and\nlives within 100 miles of the especially volatile and dangerous Niger Delta. Lawlessness\nand human rights violations, including kidnaping and extortion, by civilians and even\ngovernment personnel present significant danger throughout the country. There is no\nevidence of the Nigerian government targeting U.S. citizens to obtain protected\ninformation. However, criminals, internal insurgents and international terrorists are\nactive there, with little effective government control over their activity. \nApplicant has a close and loving relationship with his wife, son, and sister. Their\npresence in Nigeria and the conditions existing in that country, create a heightened risk\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, pressure or coercion by lawless factions acting\nagainst the official interests of the Nigerian and U.S. governments. Applicant\u2019s close\nconnections to these relatives creates the potential for conflict of interest between his\nobligation to protect sensitive information and his natural desire to assist and protect\n\n9\nthem by providing that information to unauthorized persons should they be threatened\nor coerced. Accordingly, Department Counsel established potential foreign influence\nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b).\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The three\nwhich could potentially apply in mitigation of the security concerns discussed above are:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; [and]\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nApplicant proposed that the pending departure of his wife and children from\nNigeria, and his sister\u2019s status as \u201cretired,\u201d \u201cvery elderly,\u201d \u201celderly lady\u201d (Tr. at 93, 119,\n136.) demonstrate mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a). If and when his wife and children do\nmove permanently to the U.S., that will substantially mitigate foreign influence concerns\nabout them. However, his sister will remain in Nigeria, and lives close to the most\ndangerous and lawless areas of that country. She is only two years older than Applicant\nhimself, and reliant on her extended family in Nigeria for all her needs. It is possible that\nApplicant could produce further evidence about the positions and activities of his sister,\nand the extended family upon whom she is reliant, to demonstrate that it is unlikely he\nwould be placed in a position of having to choose between her interests and those of\nthe U.S. While he did mitigate such concerns to some extent, on balance the showing\ndid not demonstrate that such conflict is unlikely.\nApplicant produced evidence that his relationships and loyalties in the U.S. are\nsubstantial. However, his obligations to his wife, children, and sister in Nigeria are also\nsubstantial. On balance, as things stand today, he did not demonstrate that he could be\nexpected to resolve ANY (emphasis added) conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest, particularly should his wife\u2019s or children\u2019s well being be threatened.\nLongstanding precedent holds that an Applicant need not, and should not, be placed in\na position to have to make such a choice. Applicant has not established mitigation\nunder AG \u00b6 8(b).\n\n10\nApplicant\u2019s contact and communication with his wife and child is neither casual\nnor infrequent. The evidence is less clear on whether his contact with his sister would\nmeet that standard. However, the presumption is that relations with immediate family\nmembers is not casual and infrequent, and Applicant provided insufficient evidence to\novercome that presumption. Accordingly, he did not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(c)\nwith respect to any of his family members in Nigeria.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves delinquent debts that were incurred due to circumstances beyond his\ncontrol. More than two years ago, however, he resumed lucrative employment and has\nregained the means to resolve these issues. He has not yet done so, and his delinquent\nindebtedness is ongoing. He is a mature and established individual who is responsible\nfor the results of his recent financial choices. Since his pregnant wife and child, and his\nsister, remain in Nigeria, his close relations with them continue to create potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation or duress which will continue until circumstances\nsubstantially change. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He has initiated several\ncourses of action that may substantially strengthen mitigation of all the security\nconcerns addressed above in the future. However, he did not meet his burden of\nshowing mitigation as things stand today, and any doubt must be resolved in favor of\nthe national security. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising from foreign influence and financial considerations. \n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact. 3 Request for Clarification of Evidence After her hearing on January 23, 2008, Applicant moved to clarify the record to indicate that the date of her last departure from Taiwan on her Taiwanese passport was February 17, 1992, and not February 17, 1997, as was suggested at her hearing. Her representation was accepted without any objections or rebuttal from the Government. Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, that Applicant\u2019s parents (SOR \u00b6 1.a), one brother (SOR \u00b6 1.b), one sister (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and parents-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.d) are resident citizens of Taiwan, and that Applicant traveled to Taiwan in December 1995, July 1998, July 2004, September 2005, and December 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). In her response of October 8, 2007, Applicant admitted the Taiwanese citizenship and residency of her family members as alleged as well as her travels to Taiwan, but denied these foreign contacts and interests raised security concerns as none of her family members held any positions in Taiwan\u2019s government. She explained that she had visited her parents in Taiwan every three to five years, although she took advantage of a change in employment to travel to Taiwan in September 2005, and she returned in December 2006 after her mother had been diagnosed with malignant lymphoma. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 51-year-old principal software engineer who has been employed by a U.S. defense con",

On September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 3, 2007. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on October 8, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s response on October 11, 2007.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 19, 2007, and the case\nwas assigned to me on November 28, 2007. On December 10, 2007, I scheduled a\nhearing for January 23, 2008.\nFebruary 15, 2008\n\n2\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on January 23, 2008. Two Government\nexhibits (Ex. 1-2) and 13 Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-M) were admitted without any\nobjections. Applicant also testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA\non February 1, 2008. At Applicant\u2019s request, the record was held open until February\n13, 2008, for her to document the formal renunciation of her Taiwanese citizenship. On\nFebruary 1, 2008, Applicant timely forwarded the certificate of renunciation, which was\nadmitted as Exhibit N without any objections. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn November 19, 2007, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be\ntaken of certain facts relating to the Republic of China (Taiwan) and to its relationship to\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The request was based on publications from the\nU.S. State Department, the Congressional Research Service, the Centre for\nCounterintelligence and Security Studies, the National Counterintelligence Center, the\nOffice of the National Counterintelligence Executive, the U.S. China Economic and\nSecurity Review Commission, on two press releases from the U.S. Department of\nJustice, and on a record of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The\ngovernment\u2019s formal request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. \nOn November 30, 2007, I notified the parties of my intention to take\nadministrative notice of specific facts, subject to revision based on the evidence\nadmitted at the hearing and any valid objections. The parties were given until December\n14, 2007, to file any objections, and Applicant to also present alternative facts for notice.\nOn December 14, 2007, the Government requested reconsideration of those\nfacts accepted for administrative notice, to include certain facts pertinent to Taiwan\nbeing an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence and to the activities of the PRC\u2019s\nMinistry of State Security. Applicant did not respond to my Order of November 30, 2007,\nor to the Government\u2019s request for reconsideration.\nAt the hearing on January 23, 2008, I granted the Government\u2019s motion to\nreconsider in part, refusing to take administrative notice of a listing of Taiwan among the\nmost active collectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information because of the\nquestionable validity of the source information relied on by the Government. Applicant\nindicated she did not object to the request for administrative notice, but questioned the\nrelevance of some of the facts to her case. After consideration of the source documents\nprovided and of the respective positions of the parties, I agreed to take administrative\nnotice of particular facts, which are set out in the Findings of Fact.\n\n3\nRequest for Clarification of Evidence\nAfter her hearing on January 23, 2008, Applicant moved to clarify the record to\nindicate that the date of her last departure from Taiwan on her Taiwanese passport was\nFebruary 17, 1992, and not February 17, 1997, as was suggested at her hearing. Her\nrepresentation was accepted without any objections or rebuttal from the Government.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, that Applicant\u2019s parents\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), one brother (SOR \u00b6 1.b), one sister (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and parents-in-law (SOR\n\u00b6 1.d) are resident citizens of Taiwan, and that Applicant traveled to Taiwan in\nDecember 1995, July 1998, July 2004, September 2005, and December 2006 (SOR \u00b6\n1.e). In her response of October 8, 2007, Applicant admitted the Taiwanese citizenship\nand residency of her family members as alleged as well as her travels to Taiwan, but\ndenied these foreign contacts and interests raised security concerns as none of her\nfamily members held any positions in Taiwan\u2019s government. She explained that she had\nvisited her parents in Taiwan every three to five years, although she took advantage of\na change in employment to travel to Taiwan in September 2005, and she returned in\nDecember 2006 after her mother had been diagnosed with malignant lymphoma. After\nconsideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old principal software engineer who has been employed by\na U.S. defense contractor since October 2005 (Ex. 1, Ex. G). She held an interim\nsecret-level security clearance that was withdrawn on issuance of the SOR (Tr. 22, 51).\nApplicant was born in Taiwan to resident citizens in June 1956. (Ex. A, Tr. 65,\n75) Her father, a native of the PRC, went to Taiwan following his high school\ngraduation. Due to the hostilities, he was prevented from returning to the PRC (Tr. 81-\n82). He settled in Taiwan, where he met and married Applicant\u2019s mother, a native of\nTaiwan. They had three other children after Applicant: sons born in 1958 and 1960 and\nanother daughter born in 1962 (Ex. 1). Applicant\u2019s parents had their own business\nexporting fish to Japan (Ex. A, Tr. 82). With their hard-earned monies, they eventually\ninvested in real estate. They bought a four-story apartment building consisting of four\nrental units. Now in their 80s, Applicant\u2019s parents have lived off the income from the\napartments since they retired (Tr. 83-85).\nApplicant earned a bachelor of arts degree in Chinese literature from a university\nin Taiwan in 1980 (Ex. 2; Tr. 51, 75). In 1981, she came to the U.S., knowing no one, to\npursue a degree in computer science (Tr. 51, 66, 68, 75). In February 1984, she earned\nher master of science in mathematics with a minor in computer science. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2,\nTr. 77). Four years later, she married a Taiwanese native whom she had met in\ngraduate school (Tr. 79-80). In September 1990, they had their only child, a son (Ex. 1,\nTr. 77-78).\n\n4\nIn February 1984, Applicant began working with a U.S. computer hardware\nmanufacturer as a systems software engineer where she gained experience in\ndatabase applications and computer network performance and security (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr.\n49). She stayed on through corporate acquisitions/mergers of the company by U.S.\ncompetitors in about 1998 and 2003 (Ex. 2).\nThe younger of Applicant\u2019s two brothers came to the U.S. in August 1985 (Ex. 2,\nTr. 104). A civil engineer, he settled in the U.S. and obtained his permanent residency\n(Ex. 1, Tr. 104). He applied for his U.S. citizenship in 2007 (Tr. 104). Applicant\u2019s\nparents, other brother, and her sister, remained in Taiwan. Her siblings in Taiwan\npursued medical degrees. After graduating from Taiwan\u2019s preeminent medical school\n(Tr. 92), Applicant\u2019s brother served his internship/residency at a public university-owned\nhospital from July 1986 to June 1991 (Ex. 2, Ex. A, Tr. 91). In July 1991, he became\naffiliated with a municipal-owned hospital where he is currently chief of pediatric surgery\n(Ex. 2, Tr. 40, 90). On her graduation from medical school, Applicant\u2019s sister served her\ninternship/residency at a veterans\u2019 hospital in Taiwan from 1988 to July 1996 (Ex. A).\nHighly successful in her chosen profession as well, Applicant\u2019s sister served as chief of\nthe plastic surgery department at a Taiwanese hospital from July 1996 to July 2004 (Ex.\n2, Tr. 97-98). During a business trip to the U.S. in the mid-1990s, Applicant\u2019s sister gave\nbirth to a son. She was visiting Applicant at the time (Tr. 101). In 2004, Applicant\u2019s sister\nwas quarantined in Taiwan during the SARS epidemic. Unhappy about not being able to\nsee her child, she ceased her affiliation with the municipal hospital in July 2004 and\njoined a private practice.(Ex. 2, Tr. 41, 99).\nOn May 13, 1991, Applicant renewed her Taiwanese passport for another six\nyears. She traveled on that passport to see her parents and siblings from January 31,\n1992, to February 17, 1992 (Ex. L).\nIn March 1992, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen, and took an oath to\nrenounce all foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its\nlaws, and to bear arms or perform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of\nthe U.S. if required.  Her spouse acquired his U.S. citizenship in September 1992 (Ex.\n1). Neither Applicant nor her spouse took any action then to renounce their Taiwanese\ncitizenship (Ex. 1).\nConcerned about the PRC\u2019s aggressive attitude toward Taiwan, Applicant\napplied for U.S. permanent residency for her brother and sister in October 1995 (Ex. B,\nEx. C, Tr. 42). Her parents were comfortable in Taiwan and expressed little interest in\nimmigrating to the U.S. (Tr. 38). In preparation for sponsoring her siblings\u2019 immigration,\nApplicant obtained a household census (family register) from Taiwan (Tr. 36).\nApplicant\u2019s brother in the U.S. was not included in the census. Applicant attributes her\nbrother\u2019s exclusion to his pursuit of U.S. citizenship (Tr. 40). However, Applicant was\nincluded in the registry as \u201c1  daughter\u201d despite the fact that she had acquired U.S.\nst\ncitizenship (Ex. A). The available record is silent as to the reason for the disparate\ntreatment.\n\nOn her e-QIP, Applicant indicated she possessed a U.S. passport issued in April 2003 (Ex. 1). Applicant\n1\ntestified she has not used her Taiwanese passport since becoming a U.S. citizen (Tr.  ), and the absence of\ntravel stamps after 1992 in her Taiwanese passport (Ex. L) bear that out. Applicant\u2019s first U.S. passport must\nhave been issued sometime before her trip in December 1995.\n5\nApplicant went to Taiwan to see her family members for two weeks in December\n1995 and for 12 days in July 1998 (Ex. 1). She traveled on her U.S. passport.  She\n1\nstayed with her parents while in Taiwan (Tr. 116-18).\nIn 2000, Applicant\u2019s sister and parents visited Applicant and her family in the U.S.\nHer sister came on a business trip and brought her parents, who stayed with Applicant\nfor one week (Tr. 88). Her brother who lives in the U.S. came to see them while they\nwere at Applicant\u2019s home (Tr. 89). Applicant\u2019s parents had previously visited her in the\nU.S. in about 1995 (Tr. 38).\nOn their son\u2019s graduation from junior high, Applicant and her spouse took him to\nTaiwan from July 15, 2004, to July 27, 2004, to visit family members. (Ex. 2, Tr. 118).\nApplicant stayed with her family and her spouse stayed primarily with his family (Tr.\n119).\nBy 2005, Applicant\u2019s employer had downsized significantly at her work location,\nbringing significant changes in her duties. After almost 22 years on the job, Applicant\nleft the commercial sector for a position as a principal software engineer with her current\nemployer, a defense contractor, in October 2005 (Tr. 49-51). Before starting work with\nher new employer, Applicant took advantage of her time off and she and her brother\ntraveled to Taiwan in September 2005 to see their parents (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 48, 52, 119-\n20).\nApplicant started work with her current employer on October 10, 2005 (Ex. G).\nOn October 24, 2005, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for investigations\nprocessing (e-QIP) in application for a secret-level security clearance. She disclosed\nher and her spouse\u2019s dual citizenship with the U.S. and Taiwan, the younger of her\nbrothers\u2019 U.S. permanent residency, the Taiwanese citizenship and residency of her\nparents, other brother, her sister, and her parents-in-law, and her trips to Taiwan to visit\nher family members in 1995, 1998, 2005 (Ex. 1). She was granted her interim-secret\nclearance shortly thereafter (Tr.  22, Tr. 51).\nIn August 2006, Applicant\u2019s sister operated on their mother for suspected\nmalignant lymphoma. (Ex. E) Concerned about her mother\u2019s health, Applicant traveled\nto Taiwan to see her in December 2006 when her workplace was shut down for the\nholidays. (Ex. 2; Ex. H, Tr. 61).\nOn August 1, 2007, Applicant responded to DOHA foreign influence and foreign\npreference interrogatories. She answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 3.e concerning whether any\nof her family members had ever been employed by a \u201cbusiness, educational institution,\nor other organization that is owned or operated by a foreign government, a component\n\n6\nof a foreign government, or a local, municipal, or regional government in a foreign\ncountry\u201d and disclosed her physician siblings\u2019 professional affiliations in Taiwan (Ex. 2).\nShe also listed her family members\u2019 Taiwanese citizenship and residency, described her\ncontacts with them, and revealed that she has also kept in touch with a high school\nfriend who works in a Taiwanese newspaper\u2019s marketing department (Ex. 2). Uncertain\nwhether 401(k) investments qualified, Applicant responded \u201cYes\u201d to question 15\nconcerning any foreign financial interests, and provided financial records, including 1099\nU.S. tax forms showing she and her spouse earned $521.42 in ordinary stock dividends\nand paid foreign taxes of $110.57 on their interest in a Taiwanese semiconductor\nmanufacturing firm in 2006.  (Ex. 2). Applicant estimated her and her spouse\u2019s net worth\nin the U.S. (real estate, bank deposits, personal property) at about $1 million (US). She\nhad 401(k) assets totaling $284,182.61 as of July 2007 (Ex.2).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse is employed as a computer engineer in the U.S. (Tr. 81).\nApplicant and her spouse do not send any financial support to her parents or parents-in-\nlaw (Tr. 122). Applicant generally contacts her parents in Taiwan about once every\nmonth to once every two months to check on their health. She called her mother once\nweekly in late 2006 and again in October 2007 when her mother was having medical\nissues (Ex. 2, Tr. 86-87). She telephones her siblings in Taiwan about once every three\nor four months (Ex. 2, Tr. 93, 102), but had more frequent contact (up to twice weekly)\nwhen their mother was being operated on (Tr. 102). Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s son lives with a\npaternal aunt in the U.S. where he attends public school with his cousin (Tr. 101).\nApplicant speaks to her in-laws once in awhile, at occasional Chinese New Years\n(Tr. 108). Her spouse calls his parents once every three months (Tr. 108). Applicant\ndoes not know what her in-laws did for work before they retired (Tr. 105). They did not\nattend Applicant\u2019s wedding and Applicant met them for the first time when they visited\nApplicant and her spouse in the U.S. in September 2001 (Tr. 106). During her visit to\nTaiwan in December 2006, Applicant learned that her father-in-law was ill so she went\nto the hospital to see him (Tr. 106). Applicant\u2019s spouse has two brothers who live in the\nU.S. (Tr. 107). They have considered applying for permanent residency for their parents\nwho are in their 70s and would face a language barrier in the U.S. (Tr. 48). Applicant\u2019s\nspouse has a sister who lives in Taiwan with whom he has no contact (Tr. 110).\nApplicant met her for the first time at the hospital in Taiwan in 2006 when she went to\nsee her father-in-law (Tr. 110).\nApplicant has seen her high school friend in Taiwan twice in the last ten years,\nmost recently in 2005 (Tr. 111-12). As of January 2008, Applicant understands her\nfriend is still employed by a Taiwanese newspaper in its marketing department (Tr.\n112). Applicant also has a friend living in Taiwan whom she met in the U.S. at the\nuniversity. This friend moved back to Taiwan about five years ago (Tr. 113). Applicant\ndid not see her when she went to Taiwan (Tr. 114), but they exchange Christmas\ngreetings by email (Tr. 115-16).\nIn October 2007, Applicant had email contact with her brother in Taiwan\nconcerning suspected recurrence of their mother\u2019s skin cancer. A subsequent biopsy\n\n7\nrevealed abnormal but not malignant cells. Applicant expressed to her brother her\nconfidence in, and appreciation for, her physician siblings\u2019 care of their mother (Ex. F,\nTr. 56). Applicant last spoke to her parents in December 2007. She discussed their\nhealth and her son\u2019s college applications (Tr. 87). \nOn December 12, 2007, the National Visa Center notified Applicant and her\nbrother in Taiwan that her petition for his and his family\u2019s (spouse and two children born\nin Taiwan in February 1994 and March 1998) immigration had been received for review.\n(Ex. D) Applicant believes her brother and his family will leave Taiwan for the U.S. if the\nimmigrant petition is approved (Tr. 96-97). Applicant\u2019s brother contacted her when he\nreceived the notice as he needed her financial support and she needed birth information\nfor his family members (Tr. 94).\nDuring a November 2006 interview with a Department of Defense investigator,\nApplicant indicated she was equally loyal to the U.S. and to Taiwan (Tr. 123-24).\nForeign occupation of Taiwan by history and concerns about the threat from the PRC,\nand gratitude to the U.S. for its opportunities and its diversity, led Applicant to change\nher position (Tr. 124-27). In August 2007, Applicant inquired at the local Taipei\nEconomic and Cultural Office about the requirements for renouncing her Taiwanese\ncitizenship (Tr. 128). After her sister in Taiwan obtained the necessary documentation\n(Tr. 128), Applicant applied on December 28, 2007, to renounce her Taiwanese\ncitizenship (Ex. M). She turned in her expired Taiwanese passport (Tr. 71). Her\nTaiwanese citizenship was revoked and a certificate of renunciation issued in January\n2008 (Ex. N). Applicant\u2019s parents respected her decision, although Applicant was\nnervous when she called to tell them of her intention to renounce her Taiwanese\ncitizenship (\u201cI was a little bit sad and that\u2019s why I called, I was kind of nervous. My father\nstill has that authority power, but I told them what I feel and how I feel about the United\nStates.\u201d Tr. 127).\nApplicant\u2019s work performance met her employer\u2019s requirements in 2006. She\nexhibited a great attitude, was a team player, and took initiative to investigate\nenhancements and modifications. She was not involved in any security violation in 2006\nor 2007 (Ex. I). When Applicant is ahead of schedule, she helps out her coworkers who\nare behind in their work (Tr. 130). Applicant hopes to regain her access so that she can\ncontribute to her employer and to society (Tr. 132).\n*     *     *\nFollowing review of official publications of the U.S. government that address the\neconomic, political, and intelligence activities of Taiwan and the PRC, I take\nadministrative notice of the following facts:\nThe government of Taiwan is a multiparty democracy. The United States\nrecognizes that there is only one China, that the government of the PRC is the sole\nlegal government of China, and that Taiwan is part of China. Under the Taiwan\nRelations Act of 1979, the U.S. conducts unofficial relations with Taiwan. Although the\n\n8\nU.S. terminated its Mutual Defense Treaty, it has continued to sell appropriate military\ndefensive material to Taiwan. The PRC has surpassed the U.S. as Taiwan\u2019s most\nimportant trading partner, but Taiwan maintains a large military establishment whose\nprimary mission is the defense of Taiwan against the PRC, which is seen as the\npredominant threat and has not renounced the use of force against Taiwan. The PRC\u2019s\nMinistry of State Security is the preeminent civilian intelligence collection agency in\nChina, and maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan, through a bureau utilizing PRC\nnationals with Taiwan connections. It is U.S. policy that the resolutions of disputes\nbetween Taiwan and China be peaceful. Taiwan is a major international trading power\nand a member of the World Trade Organization. It enjoys normal trade relations with the\nU.S., and ready access to U.S. markets. The U.S. State Department reports that Taiwan\nhas taken dramatic steps to improve respect for human rights and create a democratic\npolitical system since ending martial law. Taiwan is known to be an active collector of\nU.S. economic intelligence. In the past, organizations in Taiwan employed unlawful\nmethods to obtain U.S. economic and intelligence information. As recently as 2004, a\nfemale Taiwanese intelligence officer cultivated a covert relationship with a U.S. State\nDepartment official. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n9\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant has several close family members (parents, brother, sister) who are\nresident citizens of Taiwan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c). The security concerns underlying AG\n\u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion) are implicated. Moreover, the risk of undue foreign influence through her\nspouse and his relationship to his parents, who are also resident citizens of Taiwan\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d), requires consideration of disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 7(d) (sharing living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion).\n\n10\nThe Government also urges concerns over Applicant\u2019s travel to Taiwan in\nDecember 1995, July 1998, July 2004, September 2005, and December 2006 (SOR \u00b6\n1.e). Applicant\u2019s trips to Taiwan were to visit her parents and siblings. Her travel is\nrelevant as it confirms her affection for her family members, but there is no evidence\nthat Applicant engaged in any conduct while in Taiwan that would warrant application of\nAG \u00b6 (7)(i) (conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the\nindividual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country).\nThe close personal bond Applicant has with her parents and siblings in Taiwan\nprimarily, but also Taiwan\u2019s efforts to acquire U.S. sensitive and/or classified data,\npreclude me from applying mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or\nactivities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.). In September 2005,\nApplicant took advantage of some time off before starting her present job to visit her\nparents and siblings in Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s concern with her parents\u2019 health led her to\nreturn to Taiwan in December 2006 after her mother was diagnosed with lymphoma.\nFear for her siblings\u2019 futures in the event of PRC aggression toward Taiwan led her to\napply for U.S. permanent residency for her brother and sister in 1995, and she is\ncontinuing to assist her brother with his immigration to the U.S. He emailed her in\nDecember 2007 as he needed her financial support and she needed the official spelling\nof his family members\u2019 names and birthdays (Tr. 94). In contrast, Applicant does not\nhave close bonds with her husband\u2019s parents. While they visited Applicant\u2019s family in\nthe U.S. in 2001, and Applicant went to the hospital to see her father-in-law when she\nwas in Taiwan in 2006, she makes little effort to foster close ties. Applicant has rare\ntelephone contact with them and is even unaware of their occupational pursuits before\nthey retired.\nAs to whether the positions or activities of her close family members heighten the\nrisk, Applicant\u2019s parents had their own export business before they retired. While they\nlikely had to comply with Taiwanese laws concerning the conduct of their trading\ncompany, the fish trade was far removed from sensitive economic or military issues of\npotential concern to the Taiwanese government. Similarly, nothing about Applicant\u2019s\nsiblings\u2019 medical duties is likely to be of interest to those seeking U.S. defense\ninformation. Yet given Applicant\u2019s siblings\u2019 success in their medical careers, it is difficult\nto discount the risk of Applicant\u2019s siblings being exploited by Taiwan to enlist Applicant\u2019s\ncooperation in furnishing sensitive data. Applicant\u2019s brother is a chief of pediatric\nsurgery for a municipal hospital in Taiwan. He had attended the best medical school in\nTaiwan, and served his internship in a hospital affiliated with a government-run\nuniversity (Tr. 91). Her sister had been affiliated with a city-owned hospital as chief of\nplastic surgery, although she has been in private practice since July 2004. While Taiwan\nis a democracy that generally respects the human rights of its citizens, it has actively\n\n11\npursued U.S. economic intelligence, although there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s\nrelatives have been targeted.\nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to undue foreign influence through her close\nrelationships with foreign family members may be overcome by deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest,\neither because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest). Concerns of possible\ndivided loyalties are understandably raised by Applicant\u2019s assertion of equal loyalty to\nTaiwan and the U.S. as of November 2006. Yet Applicant\u2019s actions indicate a primary\naffiliation to the U.S. where she has resided for the past 26 years. Applicant came to the\nU.S. in 1981 to pursue an education in computer science. After earning her master\u2019s\ndegree in mathematics in February 1984, Applicant could have returned home to her\nfamily in Taiwan. Instead, she elected to pursue her career in the U.S. She married in\nthe U.S., raised a son, became a U.S. citizen, obtained a U.S. passport that she used to\ntravel abroad including to Taiwan, bought a home, and amassed considerable\nretirement assets in her U.S. 401(k) accounts. Any questions of divided loyalty have\nbeen answered by her recent renunciation of her Taiwanese citizenship.  While\nprompted primarily by fear of PRC aggression toward Taiwan and what that might mean\nfor Taiwan given its past as an occupied land, Applicant testified credibly to her\nappreciation for the U.S.:\nI said to myself this is the country that I came to, they gave me a great\nopportunity. If I\u2019m in Taiwan, I probably would be a different person, in fact\nin the last year of my college, like a lot of traditional parents, they kind of\nthink if a daughter can find a good husband, a stable job, it will be fine, but\nI feel that\u2019s not the kind of life I want. In some ways I was kind of\nindependent. When I came to the States my parents were very sad, they\nsaid you never left home before, are you sure you want to do this? And I\nsaid yes, so they said, okay, we will support whatever you decide.\nI love America, it gets all the nations, regardless of your color, your\noriginal nationality, like I met different people that came from different\ncountries, they are pursuing their lives here, and I told my son too\nsometimes when he sees the world, like the Iraq War or September 11 ,\nth\nhe got upset. I told him, well, look, America is a great country, its In God\nWe Trust, it\u2019s give human beings equal, basic rights and those are very\nimportant.\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to Taiwan. By looking at the history,\nit\u2019s changed so many times, and I\u2019m really concerned about the threat of\nChina, that\u2019s the main reason, after long consideration, then I had the\npaperwork done and I submitted the paper. I also called my parents, I said\nthis is my decision, that I\u2019m going to give up my citizenship.\n\n12\nTr. 126-27. Applicant is also continuing to assist her brother in his pursuit of U.S.\npermanent residency.\nApplicant\u2019s demonstrated commitments to the U.S. over the past 26 years and\nher trustworthiness at work must be evaluated in the context of the geopolitical realities\nthat govern U.S.-Taiwan relations, including the U.S. \u201cOne-China\u201d policy, Taiwan\u2019s\ngrowing economic ties to the PRC, and the PRC\u2019s intelligence efforts within Taiwan.\nWhile the risk of undue foreign influence cannot be ruled out, she is not likely to act\ncontrary to U.S. interests. MC \u00b6 8(b) applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty\nor allegiance, but rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7. An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet\nbe in an untenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family\nmember and the interests of the U.S. By renouncing her Taiwanese citizenship,\nApplicant has shown that she is willing to put the U.S. interests first and she is not likely\nto jeopardize the considerable ties she has developed within the U.S. over the past 26\nyears.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n13\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eisen, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-\nQIP) on October 6, 2006. On October 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, for Applicant. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 23, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nDecember 11, 2007. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on \nDecember 20, 2007. On December 28, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing \nscheduling the hearing for February 12, 2008. The case was transferred to me on \nJanuary 28, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 12, 2008. The \ngovernment offered Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1 through 4, which were admitted without \nMarch 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nobjection. Applicant\u2019s counsel called Applicant and submitted one exhibit which was \nmarked as AE A and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr) on February 21, 2008. The record closed on that date. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nDuring preliminary matters, the Government formally withdrew the Guideline J, \nCriminal Conduct allegations. (Tr at 6.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 30, 2007, with respect to \u00b6 1.a, \nApplicant admitted that an investigation took place but denies being aware of owing the \nUS government $795.56. He admits to the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.b with explanation. \n \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old senior project manager employed by a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking to maintain a security clearance. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer since August 2006. From 1964 to 1968, he served on active duty in \nthe United States Navy.  In 1969, he was hired as a civilian employee with a \nDepartment of Defense agency. He has held a security clearance since 1969. He is \nmarried and has two adult sons. (Tr at 15-18, 61-62; Gov 1.)   \n \nIn July/August 1998, Applicant was investigated for allegedly filing false local \ntravel claims.  The investigation revealed that Applicant was filing local travel claims for \ntravel to and from his work site to various contractor sites.  It was believed that \nApplicant was actually traveling to the contractor sites from his home. This was not \nreflected on his travel claims.  The distance from his home to the contractor sites is less \nthan his normal commute. Because the distance was less than his normal commute he \ncould not claim mileage.  (Gov 3.) \n \n A security badge is required in order to get into Applicant\u2019s office. A review of the \nbadge swipe records for August, September and October 1997, revealed Applicant was \nnot at the office on the dates he claimed to travel to and from the office to other \ncontractor sites. Between November 18, 1996 to October 18, 1997, Applicant filed 13 \nlocal travel claims. The total amount claimed was $6,041.51. Of that amount, only \n$767.90 was allowable. Applicant received $5,273,61 that he was not entitled to \nreceive. (Gov 3.)  \n \nApplicant claims that his actual travel was from a contractor site facility that was \nabout a half mile from his office. When he filed the travel claim, he used his office as \nreference as opposed to the contractor site.  He had no documentation to verify this.  \nHe also was advised in 1992 or 1993 by an employee who processed travel claims in \nhis former office that he could claim for local travel. (Tr at 35-36, 47-48; Gov 3 at 4.) His \nold office merged with his new office as a result of the base realignment and closure  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nprocess. (Tr at 27.) He was not aware that his filing for local travel claims was \nerroneous until he received guidance from the new office in conjunction with the 1998 \ninvestigation.  \n \nInitially, Applicant wanted to fight the allegations but his division chief told him to \nmake restitution on the amount he was not authorized to receive and the matter would \nbe handled administratively. He repaid the amount of the travel claim he was not \nauthorized to receive. (Tr at 34-36.) \n \nIn November 2003, an anonymous hotline complaint was filed alleging Applicant \nwas arriving to work late and leaving early. Physical surveillance of Applicant\u2019s arrival \nand departure from work was conducted between November 30, 2003, and December \n20, 2003. Applicant\u2019s time cards were reviewed during that same period. It was \ndiscovered that Applicant was absent from work 19 hours or 22% of his reported work \ntime. The investigation concluded that Applicant needed to repay the amount he was \npaid for hours not worked in the amount of $795.96.  On January 9, 2004, Applicant was \ninterviewed. The report indicates that Applicant admitted that he was abusing his work \ntime by arriving late and leaving early or not bothering to come in at all. The \ninvestigation report does not include a signed, sworn statement from the Applicant. \n(Gov 4.) \n \nIn January 2004, Applicant retired.  Although he was aware of the investigation, \nhe was never told that he owed the federal government $795.  There is no evidence that  \nattempts were made to collect the debt. Applicant claims that although he was not in the \noffice for the full amount of the time claimed on his time cards, part of the time he was \ntelecommuting from home.  He would begin his day checking and responding to e-mail \ntraffic prior to leaving his home because he had a long commute. On one day, he called \nhis secretary to tell her that he would not be in the next day due to the weather but she \nnever processed the leave request. He claims that he had permission to telecommute \nfrom his supervisor. (Tr at 52-58.) Applicant never admitted to abusing his work hours \nas mentioned in the investigative report. He claims the statement in the investigative \nreport claiming he admitted to arriving late and leaving early was the investigator\u2019s \nstatement.  He claims he made no such admission. (Tr at 59.)    \n \nApplicant has worked for his current employer since August 2006. In November \n2006, he received a promotion. (AE E at 8.) He received an outstanding rating in his  \n2007 performance report. His manager states that Applicant is a valuable asset to the \ncompany and to the customer.  The customer has contacted him several times to tell \nhim what a great job Applicant has been doing. (AE A at 1-4.)  Applicant has also \nreceived several awards in the past as well for his work performance. (AE A at 5-7.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n4 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nThe personal conduct guideline lists several disqualifying conditions. Two \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) potentially apply in Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  They are:  \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \n \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \n \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \n \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \n \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \n \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \n \nproperly safeguard protected information.) \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \n \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \n \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \n \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \n \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \n \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \n \nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information. This \n \nincludes but is not limited to consideration of: (3) a pattern of dishonesty or \n \nrule violations; (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \n \nemployer\u2019s time or resources.)   \n \n \nSecurity concerns are raised due to Applicant filing local travel claims for travel \nnot authorized to be reimbursed.  He also allegedly submitted false time cards over a \nthree week period in December 2003, one month before he retired.  Both of these \ninstances consist of a pattern of rule violations. Both also infer an abuse of government \ntime and resources.  \n \n \nThe personal conduct security concerns can be mitigated.  I find that Personal \nConduct Mitigating Condition \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has \npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. The allegations related to the \nfalse local travel claims occurred in 1998.  There was some confusion about what \nexpenses were proper when filing of local travel claims in Applicant\u2019s previous office. \nOnce the proper procedures were pointed out to Applicant, he reimbursed the federal \ngovernment for the total amount overpaid on the local travel claims. One cannot \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconclude with certainty that he intended to file false travel claims. The time and \nattendance abuse allegations arose in November/December 2003.  Although the hotline \nreport concluded that Applicant abused his time and attendance by coming in late and \nleaving early, no further action was taken to collect the money the investigator \nconcluded that Applicant owed.  The investigative report contains no signed, sworn \nstatements pertaining to the specific allegations.  Although the investigating officer \nconcluded that Applicant owed the government $795, there is no evidence that indicates \nApplicant was notified of this debt and given the opportunity to respond.  The \ngovernment took no formal action to collect the debt.   \n \n \nAlthough both of the allegations raised security concerns, more than four years \nhave passed since the last incident. Applicant\u2019s current employer states that Applicant \nhas done an outstanding job. I conclude that at the present time, Applicant is not a \nsecurity risk. Applicant mitigated the concerns raised under personal conduct.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nwork history with his current employer, his 42 years of experience as a Department of \nDefense civilian employee, and that more than four years have passed with no \nsubsequent issues. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn November 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 29, 2007, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 2, 2008, and was scheduled for\nhearing on January 29, 2008.  A hearing was held on January 29, 2008, for the purpose\nof considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of two exhibits; Applicant relied on three witnesses (including herself) and\nApril 2, 2008\n\n2\neight exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on February 6, 2008.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified\ninformation is granted.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of nine\ndocuments:  Background Note: Taiwan, U.S. Department of State (April 2007); Taiwan:\nrecent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, Congressional Research Service, Library\nof Congress (October 2006); Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic\nCollection and Industrial Espionage 2000, National Counterintelligence Center; Press\nRelease, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney (WD NY April 2006); Press Release,\nU.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney (ED VA January 2007); Statement of Facts\n[stipulated], United States v. Keyser, Crim. Case No.1:05CR543, (ED VA December\n2005); Intelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency\nOPSEC Support Staff (IOSS) (June 2004); Background Note: China, U.S. Department of\nState (January 2007); 2006 Report to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and Security\nReview Commission (November 2006); Annual Report to Congress on foreign Economic\nCollection and Industrial Espionage 2005, National Counterintelligence Executive -2005\n(August 2006); Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006, China (March 2007;\nConsular Information Sheet on China, U.S. Department of State (March 2007).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007); ISCR\nCase No. 02-24875 (App. Bd. October 2006).  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known.   See Stein, Administrative\nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in Taiwan.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evi.  This notice did  not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing Taiwan\u2019s current state.  \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\n         At the outset of the hearing, Applicant confirmed her waiver of the 15-day written\nnotice requirement in the Additional Procedural Guidance of the Directive.  The 15-day\nwritten notice requirement was, accordingly, waived. \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged (a) to have parents who are citizens and\nresidents of Taiwan, (b) to have expressed in July 2007 that she has the responsibility to\ntake care of her parents, (c) to have a paternal grandfather, and many aunts, uncles,\ncousins, and friends who are citizens and residents of Taiwan, (d) to have a friend who is\na citizen of Taiwan who resides in the U.S., (e) to have a father who served as a major in\na AS division of the Taiwan AF from approximately 1985 to April 1991, (f) to have a\n\n3\npaternal grandfather who served in the Taiwan military from approximately 1943 until\n1968, (g) to have various uncles and cousins who have served in the Taiwan military, (h)\nto have two uncles who currently work for the Taiwan government, (I) to have traveled to\nTaiwan in approximately December 1999, June 2001, May 2004, and December 2006 to\nvisit her parents and relatives, and also in August 2004 to attend her grandmother\u2019s\nfuneral, (j), to have stated in July 2007 that she is vulnerable to pressure, coercion, or\nduress based on her family members\u2019 non-U.S. citizenship, and (k) to have received\napproximately $15,000.00 from her father between November 2006 and January 2007.\nFor her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations in the SOR\nwith explanations.  She denied any current financial support for her parents, but\nacknowledged her responsibility to support her parents should they require it.  She\nclaimed to have only brief contact with her relatives other than her parents.  She\nadmitted to having a good friend in the U.S. from the PRC (not Taiwan as alleged), and\nclaimed her father took early retirement from the Taiwan AF and has worked as a\ncommercial airlines pilot for the past 15 years.  She claimed a mandatory draft in Taiwan\nfor all males to serve in the military and identified the government departments that\nemploy her two uncles in Taiwan.  She acknowledged visits to Taiwan to see her\nparents, and to attend her grandmother\u2019s funeral.  She admitted to saying \u201cyes\u201d to a\nquestion posed to her about being vulnerable to pressure out of love for her parents but\nclaimed a misunderstanding of the implications of her answer.  And she acknowledged\nreceiving money from her father for a down-payment on a home purchase in the U.S. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 24-year-old electrical engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant immigrated (along with her sister) to the U.S. from Taiwan in 1998 at the\nage of 15 (R.T., at 54-55).  She and her sister have since forged strong bonds together,\nand attended college together (see ex. A; R.T, at 55-56).\n For the first several months of her residence in the U.S. Applicant lived with her\naunt (R.T., at 67).  She went on to complete her high school curriculum in the U.S., and\nsubsequently her undergraduate college studies in electrical engineering in December\n2005 in a prestigious U.S. university (see exs. 1 and C; R.T., at 54).  She applied for\nU.S. citizenship and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2004 (see ex 1).  Applicant\nis currently pursuing graduate studies at the same university in her field of emphasis\n(electrical engineering) and expects to receive her M.S degree in EE in Spring 2008\n(R.T., at 54-55).\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Her mother is a\nhomemaker who has never worked for the Taiwan Government that Applicant can\n\n4\npersonally recall.  Her father graduated from the Taiwan Air Force (AF) Academy and\njoined the AF as a military pilot.  He served in the Taiwan AF between 1976 and 1991\n(see ex. A; R.T., at 56-57, 74), and retired with the rank of major (R.T., at 75).  Upon his\nretirement, he received a lump sum settlement of $65,000.00 (R.T., at 76).  Following his\nretirement he became a commercial airline pilot, and continues to work in that capacity\n(see ex. B).  Applicant\u2019s father has no connections with the Taiwan Government, but did\naccompany his parents on one occasion to visit their parents in the PRC  (see ex. A;\nR.T., at 57, 77-78).\nApplicant has a paternal grandfather, and three other grandparents as well as\nseveral aunts, uncles, and cousins.  All but two of the grandparents are citizens and\nresidents of Taiwan (R.T., at 79-81).  The two remaining surviving grandparents reside in\nthe PRC (R.T., at 79-81).  Her paternal grandfather, all of her uncles, and several of her\ncousins have served in the Taiwan military, which is mandatory in Taiwan (R.T., at 92-\n93).  Two of her uncles currently work for the Taiwan Government.  One works for the\nTaiwan post office; while the other works for a budget planning group (R.T., at 59-60,\n95).  To the best of Applicant\u2019s knowledge, her parents\u2019 contact with their relatives\nresiding in the PRC is not very frequent (R.T., at 82-84).\nBesides her relatives who reside in the U.S. and Taiwan, Applicant has a good\nfriend who resides in the U.S., while remaining a citizen of the PRC (R.T., at 61-62, 96-\n99).  This friend has since applied for a green card to work in the U.S., and awaits\nnotification of the results.  \nUpon becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant relinquished her Taiwan passport (R.T.,\nat 67).  Although she never officially renounced her Taiwan citizenship, she does not\nbelieve she has any obligations to Taiwan (R.T., at 69).  While she retains her loyalties to\nher parents, her primary loyalties lie with the U.S. (R.T., at 70, 89), she does not foresee\nany need to take care of them financially.  Applicant has never served in the Taiwan\nmilitary and has never been employed by the Taiwan Government (R.T., at 70-71).  \nBefore becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant made a number of trips to\nTaiwan to visit her parents and other family members: specifically, in December 1999,\nJune 2001, May 2004, and December 2006.  She made an additional trip to Taiwan after\nin August 2004 to attend her grandmother\u2019s funeral.  While it is not clear from the record\nwhich passports she used after she became a U.S. citizen, she assures that she turned\nher Taiwan passport over to her facility clearance officer (FSO), who reportedly\ndestroyed it (R.T., at 103-04).  Applicant maintains regular monthly telephone contacts\nwith her parents (R.T., at 57, 86), but has few telephone contacts with her other relatives\nresiding in Taiwan (R.T., at 90-92).\nApplicant has a financial advisor to help her save on buying a home in the\ngeographical area of her employment (R.T., at 63).  She fully supports herself and has\ninvested most of her savings in investment accounts (see exs. E, F and G).  She\nmaintains all of her financial interests in the U.S., and none in Taiwan (R.T., at 63, 102).\nTo be sure, she has received financial support from her father to help underwrite the\n\n5\ndown payment (estimated to be $15,000.00 between November 2006 and January 2007)\non her planned purchase of a home.  She has invested this money and does not want to\nliquidate her shares in this investment out of concern of taking an investment loss (R.T.,\nat 63).  She expects to be able to save enough over the next two years to be able to\npurchase a home, and expresses her desire to complete her graduate studies, and\ncontinue working for her current employer (R.T., at 113-14). \nApplicant has no reason to believe any of her immediate family members residing\nin Taiwan are at any risk to coercion, pressure or influence (R.T., at 105).  She has\nreceived security training and briefing and has held an interim security clearance since\nJanuary 2006 (see ex. H).  She pledges to continue to abide by security procedures and\nwould report any foreign contacts or attempts to influence her to her FSO (R.T., at 61,\n106).  And one potentially troublesome statement attributable to her (i.e., her July 2007\nstatement that she is vulnerable to pressure, coercion, or duress based on her family\nmembers that are not citizens of the U.S.) has been thoroughly explained by Applicant\nas the result of misinterpreting the question, and exercising an abundance of caution in\nrecognition of her continued love for her family, and is reconciled with her extensive\nsecurity training and briefing (R.T., at 58, 89).\nSupervisors, co-workers and friends who have known Applicant for a number of\nyears attest to her honesty and trustworthiness (see ex. A; R.T. at 123, 127-28).   Both\nher section manager and her mentor credit her with outstanding performance, reliability\nand trustworthiness (see ex. A). \nTaiwan\u2019s country status\nTaiwan has a rich history that dates back 12 to 15 thousand years.  Dutch and\nSpanish colonists claimed the island in the 16  and 17  centuries (see Background Note:\nth\nth\nTaiwan, U.S. Department of State (April 2007)).  Migration from the Chinese mainland\nover time supplanted the  aborigines peoples of Taiwan.  Japan exerted considerable\ninfluence over Taiwan following China\u2019s ceding of Taiwan to Japan in 1895 (see\nBackground Note: Taiwan, supra, at 3).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Taiwan reverted to Chinese rule.  Civil\nwar erupted soon after the reversion between Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s KMT government and\nthe increasingly influential Chinese Communist Party guided by Mao Zedong.  When the\ncivil war ended in 1949, 2 million refugees (predominantly nationalists) fled to Taiwan,\nwhere Chiang Kai-Shek established a separate provisional KMT capital in Taipei (see\nBackground Note: Taiwan, supra, at 3). Mao\u2019s victorious Communist party, in turn,\nestablished the People\u2019 s Republic of China (PRC).\nFor the past one-half century, Taiwan has demonstrated steady economic\ndevelopment and today is a major international trading power.  Its accession to the WTO\nin 2002 represented a significant achievement and strengthened its standing in the\nexpanding global economy. \n\n6\nTaiwan has exhibited steady political development as well since its establishment\nas an island government. Changes reflect a continuing liberalizing process that\nculminated in the tightly contested election of Chen Shui-bian in 2000 (see Background\nNote: Taiwan, supra, at 3).   Chen\u2019s DPP party won major parliamentary victories in 2000\nand again in 2004, enabling Chen to become the first opposition party candidate to win\nthe presidency.  Chen was re-elected in 2004 on a platform that included a \u201cdefensive\nreferendum\u201d (Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 6).  Such referenda have been\nhistorically perceived to be closely linked to the question of Taiwan\u2019s independence.\nToday\u2019s Taiwan political system can appropriately be described as a multi-party\ndemocracy  under a Constitutional umbrella comprising five branches: executive,\nlegislative, judicial, control and examination.  By all accounts, Taiwan has a good human\nrights record and has demonstrated respect for the rule of contract in its commercial\nrelations.\nTaiwan\u2019s PRC relations\nThe PRC does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence, and insists that there is\nonly \u201cone China\u201d (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 6).  Despite differences over\nthe PRC\u2019s one China policy, Taiwan and the PRC have enjoyed increased contacts over\nthe past decade.  With Taiwan\u2019s continued relaxation of its PRC policy regarding\nunofficial contacts, cross-strait interactions have grown significantly.  Efforts by the PRC,\nhowever, to resume cross-strait dialogue without any preconditions have been hampered\nby the PRC\u2019s insistence that the two sides first reach consensus that there is only \u201cone\nChina\u201d before restarting talks (see id.).  Cheng has recognized the PRC\u2019s \u201cone China\u201d\ninsistence but to date has declined to condone the concept.  With both sides unwilling to\ncompromise this obstacle, they have cautiously felt each other out with smaller\nintermediary steps like cross-strait cargo and passenger charter flights, sale of Taiwan\nagricultural products in the PRC, and PRC tourists visiting Taiwan (see id).  \nThe PRC operates a large and sophisticated intelligence bureau, entitled the MSS\n(see Intelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency\nOPSEC Support Staff (IOSS), at 71 (June 2004)).  The MSS maintains active\nintelligence gathering operations in Taiwan (see id., at 72).  These operations use\nclandestine agents to collect intelligence on Western consortia investing in the PRC who\nare suspected of involvement in attempts to democratize the PRC, as well as other pro-\ndemocracy groups thought to be engaging in anti-communist activities (see Intelligence\nThreat Handbook, supra, at 72). \nCompounding security concerns over the PRC\u2019s robust intelligence gathering\noperations in Taiwan is the PRC regime\u2019s poor human rights record.  The State\nDepartment reports an increased number of high profile cases in the PRC involving the\nmonitoring, harassment, detention, arrest, and imprisonment of journalists, writers,\nactivists, and defense lawyers seeking to exercise their law-protected rights (see China,\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006, U.S. Department of State (March\n2007)).  The State Department cites a comprehensive, credible accounting of all those\n\n7\nkilled, missing, or detained, reported incidents of deaths in custody, disappearance,\ntorture, and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment (see id., at 2-3).\nWhile the PRC officially denies holding any political prisoners, Western non-government\norganizations estimate that approximately 500 persons remained in prison in 2006 for the\nrepealed crime of counterrevolution, and thousands of others were either serving\nsentences or were being detained for counter-revolutionary offenses (id., at 8).  State\nDepartment advisories caution American citizens visiting or residing in China to take the\nnormal safety precautions and remain aware of their individual surroundings (see\nConsular Information Sheet, U.S. Department of State, March 2007).  \nIn the current political environment, it is still too early to predict the direction of\ncross-strait negotiations between Taiwan and the PRC.  Because of the PRC\u2019s long\ninsistence on Taiwan\u2019s acceptance of the \u2018one China\u201d principle as a requisite to any jump-\nstarting of negotiations over practical agreements in trade, cultural exchanges, and other\nareas of mutual interest, future relations between the two sides remain cloudy at best.\nU.S.-Taiwan relations\nIn a joint communique with the PRC in January 1979, the U.S. announced its\nrecognition of the government of the PRC as the sole government of China and that there\nis but one China, of which Taiwan is a part (see Background Note; China, U.S.\nDepartment of State, at 8 (January 2007).  The Joint Communique stated that within this\ncontext the people of the U.S. will maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial\nrelations with the people of Taiwan.\nTo implement the Joint communique, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act\n(TRA) in April 1979.  President Carter, in turn, signed the legislation into law on April 10,\n1979.  Besides providing the legal basis for maintaining the U.S. unofficial relationship\nwith Taiwan, the TRA reinforced the U.S. commitment to providing defense assistance to\nTaiwan.  The TRA expressly provides for the continued sale of appropriate defensive\nmilitary equipment to Taiwan and declares that peace and stability in the area are in U.S.\ninterests (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 9).  And even though the U.S.\nterminated its Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan following its de-recognition of the latter,\nit has continued its sale of appropriate defensive military equipment to Taiwan (see id.).\nWhile ambiguously written, the U.S. commitment to Taiwan\u2019s security against\ncross-Strait aggression by the PRC\u2019s military forces is implicit in the TRA\u2019s coverage of\nU.S. responsibilities towards Taiwan.  This implicit construction is oft-used to support\nproponents of a \u201ctwo China\u201d policy.  To be sure, initial actions of the Bush Administration\nin 2001 provided cause to conclude the new President had abandoned longstanding U.S.\npolicy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d in favor of a policy that placed a clearer emphasis on\nTaiwan\u2019s interests at the expense of the PRC (see Taiwan: Recent Developments and\nU.S. Policy Choices, CRS Report to Congress, at 13 (October 2006)).  More recent\ndevelopments, though, reflect the smoothing of U.S.-PRC relations as a part of the\nbroader war on terrorism.  \n\n8\nCurrently, the U.S. does not support Taiwan independence and opposes unilateral\nsteps by either side to alter the status quo (see Background Note; China, supra, at 20).\nFor so long as Taiwan\u2019s national security remains under threat (both veiled and unveiled)\nfrom the PRC, Taiwan can be expected to pursue the development of its military amidst\nexpectations of military assistance from the U.S.  Stressing self-reliance, Taiwan\nmaintains a large military establishment (accounting for 15.3 per cent of its central\nbudget).  Its principal mission is to defend itself against the PRC, which has not\nrenounced the use of force against Taiwan (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 8). \nWith its unchanged public policy of maintaining \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d in its official relations\nwith Taiwan, the U.S. can be expected to continue its support of Taiwan\u2019s island security\nwith the sale of defensive military equipment.\nTaiwan\u2019s economic collection practices\nBased on past reports to Congress, Taiwan is considered one of the most active\ncollectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information.  In its 2000 Annual Report to\nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, the preparers  list\nTaiwan as well as the PRC among the most active collectors based on cited surveys (see\n2000 Annual Report  to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial\nEspionage, National Counterintelligence Center (NACIC), at 16).  Specific incidents are\ncited  in the NACIC Report that identify offenders of proprietary information thefts and\nattempts to acquire export-restricted products (see id., 7-10). \nRecent espionage convictions document ongoing collection activities covering theft\nof sensitive and proprietary information by and for Taiwan companies (see, e.g., 2006\nReport to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, at 139\n(November 2006); Press Release, U.S. Department of justice, U.S. Attorney (WD NY\nApril 2006); Press Release, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney (ED VA January\n2007), and Statement of Facts (stipulated),  No. 1:05CR 543 (December 2005). \nMultilateral export control regimes in place are voluntary and not universally adhered to\nby member nations (see id., at 143).\nStress points between Taiwan, the PRC and the U.S.\nIn its November 2006 Report to Congress, the Security Review Commission\ndescribes the PRC as a country intent on acquiring and exploiting the knowledge\ndeveloped by multiples of collection agents: legally, if possible, and otherwise illegally by\nespionage (see 2006 Report to Congress, supra, at 138.  The PRC\u2019s concerted efforts to\nacquire sensitive technology poses a considerable challenge to U.S. counterintelligence\nmeasures.  Recent indictments of Chinese citizens for espionage have served to highlight\nthe PRC\u2019s spying activities in the U.S. (see id.).  Violating  its own 2004 U.S.-China\nagreement, the PRC oft-fails to schedule timely end-use inspection visits of dual-use\nitems licensed for export to the PRC.  Better export controls can be effective only if they\nare multilateral in scope (see id.).  Multilateral export controls and arms embargoes,\nhowever, do  provide additional insurance against altering the cross-strait military balance\nthat has been long maintained (see id., at 144).\n\n9\nWithout effective dual use export controls in place, the PRC can be expected to\nacquire dual use technologies with military potential from the U.S. and Taiwan through the\nU.S. and other source countries.  Reported intelligence, though, is lacking on any Taiwan\nuse of its collection resources in the U.S. to supply the PRC with needed military\ntechnology (alone or through technology with known dual use capabilities).\nOther stress points between the PRC and Taiwan are reflected in periodic PRC\nmilitary exercises in the Taiwan Straits (see Background Note: China, supra, at 19).  More\nfrequent U.S.-PRC high-level exchanges have the potential to reduce cross-strait military\ntensions (id., at 19).  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or\ndenied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in\narriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\u201d\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\n\n10\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security\nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nANALYSIS\nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan in\n1998 to further her education pursuits.  Security issues of concern to the Government\nfocus on members of Applicant\u2019s immediate family (i.e., her parents, paternal grandfather)\nand extended family members who are citizens and residents of Taiwan, a country\nhistorically friendly to the U.S., albeit, one with a reported history of economic collection\nactivities in the U.S.\nDepartment Counsel urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s parents,\npaternal grandfather, and other family members residing in Taiwan, might be subject to\nundue foreign influence by Taiwanese government authorities to access classified\ninformation in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  Because Applicant\u2019s immediate and\nextended family members reside in Taiwan, they present potential heightened security\nrisks covered by disqualifying condition  (DC) 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the Adjudication Guidelines for\nforeign influence. The citizenship/residence status of these immediate and non-immediate\nfamily members in Taiwan pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the\nrisks of undue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or classified information\nunder Applicant's possession and/or control. \n\n11\nBecause Applicant\u2019s father, paternal grandfather, uncles and cousins residents all\nhave prior military service (although aged for the most part), some consideration of DC\n7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information,\u201d is warranted as well.  Applicant\u2019s contacts with her\nparents and other family members residing in Taiwan afford her some potential for\naccessing Taiwan officials who might be interested in proprietary, sensitive, or even\nclassified information that Applicant is privy to.  Still, none of Applicant\u2019s family members\nhave any identified affiliations or contacts with Taiwan officials currently known to be\nassociated with intelligence or military organizations interested in collecting proprietary or\nsensitive information in the U.S.\nFurther, from what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s\nimmediate family residing in Taiwan have any political affiliations with Taiwan\u2019s\ngovernment, have any history to date of being subjected to any coercion or influence, or\nappear to be vulnerable to the same.  Applicant\u2019s father is a graduate of Taiwan\u2019s\nprestigious AF Academy, and served for many years in Taiwan\u2019s AF, but has had no\nconnection with the Taiwan government or military since his retirement in 1991.  Also, two\nof her uncles hold low level positions with Taiwan government agencies.  None of these\nrecited positions, however, involve intelligence or military operations and, as such, are not\nlikely to make any of these relatives foreseeable subjects of interest to Taiwan foreign\ndata collection officials. Upon fully considering Applicant\u2019s explanations about her\nimmediate family and extended family members, any risk of undue foreign influence on\nApplicant and/or her parents, paternal grandparents, and extended family members would\nappear to be insubstantial, and clearly not of the magnitude that could make them subject\nto a heightened security risk of pressure or compromise under Guideline B.\nTaiwan, although a country reported to have targeted U.S. economic and\nproprietary interests in the past, enjoys a special relationship with the U.S. through the\nTRA, and is a democratic government with a history of respect for human rights and the\nrule of law.  While Taiwan has been a reported active collector of economic intelligence in\nthe U.S., it has not been known to use acquired information to harm U.S. strategic\ninterests.  Taiwan remains a member in good standing with the WTO, and a constructive\ntrading partner with the U.S., who at times has itself been targeted by agents of the PRC\nfor intelligence collection on Western groups thought to be promoting democracy and\nengaging in anti-communist activities directed at the PRC.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are\ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable\nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by\npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Taiwan. \n\n12\nThe special relationship that has existed between the U.S. and Taiwan over the\npast half-century has been one marked by mutually reconcilable political and economic\ninterests. Reports of Taiwan intelligence gathering against U.S. companies are\ncounterbalanced by Taiwan\u2019s history of friendship and partnership in a defense pact\nformalized in 1979.  The mutually supportive bonds that have linked Taiwan\u2019s special\nrelationship with the U.S. have not been weakened by either the TRA, or the  geopolitical\nforces that have shaped the U.S.\u2019s evolving relationship with the PRC.  Whatever\npotential heightened security risks arise as the result of Applicant's having family\nmembers with citizenship and residency in Taiwan are by every reasonable measure\nmitigated.  \nTaiwan remains a friend of the U.S. and is a country whose democratic institutions\nare not incompatible with our own traditions and respect for human rights and the rule of\nlaw.  Unlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, the new ones do take account of the covered\ncountry\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in gauging\nwhether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create a\nheightened security risk.  The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign\nregime involved do matter.  Taiwan, while reported to target the U.S. and its companies in\nthe past for economic and proprietary information, is still a country with no known recent\nhistory of hostage taking or disposition for exerting undue influence against family\nmembers to obtain either classified information, or unclassified economic and proprietary\ndata. \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's immediate\nand extended family members in Taiwan  (a country whose interests have recently been\nand continue to be friendly to those of the U.S.), any potential heightened risk of a\nhostage situation or undue foreign influence brought in the hopes of eliciting either\nclassified information or economic or proprietary data out of Applicant through her family\nmembers residing in Taiwan is an acceptable one.  Applicant, accordingly, may take\nadvantage of one important mitigating condition: MC 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the persons or\nactivities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S..\u201d \nMC (8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or\nthe individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest\u201d has application, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation.  Both at home and through those in\nsenior positions with Applicant\u2019s employer, W has demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and\nprofessional commitments to the U.S. since becoming Applicant\u2019s spouse in 2002, and a\nnaturalized citizen in 2006.  Whatever potential conflicts she may have through her dual\nTaiwan citizenship and contacts with her family members in Taiwan have been more than\ncounterbalanced by her demonstrated U.S. citizenship responsibilities.  \n\n13\nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to conflict\nof interests with her Taiwan family members. Not only has Applicant become a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen and received her education (both high school and college) in the\nU.S., but she has made every efforts to work, save, and pursue her financial interests\nexclusively in the U.S. (albeit with some prior financial help from her father).  Applicant is\nhighly regarded and trusted by her supervisor and co-workers and is not aware of any\nrisks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of her family members might be exposed\nto.  Under these recounted circumstances, any likelihood of any coercion, pressure, or\ninfluence being brought to bear on any of her family members would appear to be minimal\nat this time.   Put another way, Applicant has no visible conflicts of interest with Taiwan\ncitizen/residents or property interests in Taiwan that could be at risk to exploitation or\ncompromise by Taiwan military or intelligence officials.  \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's family members\nin Taiwan are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's\nability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to her familial relationships in\nTaiwan.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nGuideline B.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2.2.2 of the\nAdjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.k::\nFOR APPLICANT\n CONCLUSIONS\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \n                                  \nRoger C.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 7, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on December 3, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on\nFebruary 20, 2008.  A hearing was held on February 20, 2008, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of six exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on February 28, 2008.  Based upon a review of the\nApril 22, 2008\n\n2\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated eight delinquent debts\nexceeding $27,000.00: specifically, four consumer debts exceeding $11,000.00, a\nstudent loan debt of $1,710.00, back child support totaling $8,841.00, a military credit\nunion account of $4,112.00, and an IRS debt for taxes owed in the amount of\n$1,600.00. Applicant admitted the alleged debts with explanations.  He claimed to be\nmaking monthly payments on three of his consumer debts and his IRS debt.  He\nclaimed to have paid his alleged back child support and will try to address the remaining\ntwo debts. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of the status of his admitted debts (including payment history\non his back child support and taxes owed to the IRS).  For good cause shown, Applicant\nwas granted seven days to supplement the record.  The Government was afforded\nthree days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record\nwith a running balance of his back child support payments and a prior billings\ntransactions statement, which Applicant claims to reference his payment history with a\ncertain creditor named in the SOR.  Department Counsel did not object to either of\nApplicant\u2019s two submissions, but noted that the prior billings statement contains different\naccount numbers for the creditor identified by Applicant in his submission.  Applicant\u2019s\nexhibits are admitted as exhibits A and B, and will be assigned the appropriate weight\nthey warrant.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42-year-old electronics technician for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married his first wife (W1) in April 1992 and divorced her in December\n1999 (ex. 1).   He has two children from this marriage (ages 14 and 15) who reside with\ntheir mother.  Applicant remarried (W2) in 2001 and has no children from this marriage.\nHe has recently separated from W2 (R.T., at 46).\nFollowing his second DuI offense in 1995, Applicant\u2019s security clearance was\nrevoked, in October 1997.  Records reflect that he received a general discharge for\nmisconduct after his security clearance was revoked (see exs. 2 and 3; R.T., at 37).\nApplicant successfully completed an alcohol and drug rehabilitation program in February\n1999 (see ex. 3), and remained in the military until January 2000 (R.T., at 37-38).\n\n3\nApplicant acknowledges to have lived beyond his means somewhat while\nmarried to W1 (R.T., at 47-48).  Unable to find work after his exit from the Army in 2000,\nhe fell behind with a number of his debts.  Records report that he accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent consumer debts between 1997 and 2004, attributable to his\ndivorce.  His delinquent debts covered in his credit reports include four consumer\naccounts exceeding $11,000.00 (including a deficiency balance on a repossessed\nvehicle in the amount of $5,710.00, back child support exceeding $8.841.00, a military\ncredit union debt approximating $4,112.00, and taxes owed the IRS in the amount of\n$1,600.00).\nApplicant claims major progress in paying off his listed debts.  He claims to have\nreduced the listed balance with creditor 1.a (a deficiency balance owed on returned\nutility equipment in the 1999-2000 time frame) to $437.00 in October 2007, and no\nlonger receives any bills from this creditor (R.T., at 38-39).  However, Applicant provides\nno documentation of promised account information detailing his payments to creditor\n1.a and current status of the account.\nApplicant claims he has been making regular payments on his creditor 1.b\naccount (see ex. 6) and to have made considerable progress in clearing this debt (R.T.,\nat 40-41).  He has made recent payments on the account and committed to furnishing\nbank statements that reflect his debt payments on this account (R.T., at 40).  The post\nbilling transaction ledger (ex. B) that reportedly covers this debt lists account numbers\nthat do not appear to match the account number in Applicant\u2019s credit report (ex. 5) for\nthis creditor.  Further, the prior billings transaction document does not reflect the\nbalance still owing on this account.  Without more clarification, little payment credit can\nbe accorded Applicant.\nAddressing the status of creditor 1.c, Applicant admits only to being a card holder\non a credit card account opened by his first wife (W1) before their divorce in December\n1999 (see exs. 1 and 3; R.T., at 41-42).  He claims he never used the card and never\nassumed responsibility for its payment (R.T., at 42).  Applicant disputes this debt but\nprovides no documentation of any correspondence with either the creditor or the credit\nreporting agency.  \nApplicant admits to incurring delinquent debts with creditors 1.d through 1.h.\nCreditor 1.d represents a student loan that he claims to have partially paid down under\na payment plan he arranged with the creditor (see ex. 3; R.T., at 42).  Under his\npayment plan with the creditor, he made monthly payments of $107.00 for about five\nmonths, before he quit making payments altogether in December 2007 (see ex. 6).\nCurrently, he does not know what balance remains on this debt (R.T., at 42). \nWith respect to creditor 1.e, Applicant co-signed for a 1998 car purchased by his\nstep-son from his marriage to W1. He recollects his step-son\u2019s paying around\n$11,000.00 for the vehicle (R.T., at 43, 59).  When the step-son stopped making\npayments on the car in 2000, the seller called Applicant to ascertain Applicant\u2019s taking\nover his step-son\u2019s payments (R.T., at 60).  Applicant declined the seller\u2019s request at the\ntime and only learned of the vehicle\u2019s repossession (sometime in 2000) when he got his\n\n4\nown credit report in 2007, and checked the status of the vehicle.  Applicant has just\nobtained his step-son\u2019s telephone number and will attempt to reach him to ascertain his\npayment intentions. \nApplicant claims to have paid off his back child support (creditor 1.f), which was\nsignificant according to his December 2006 credit report (i.e., $8,841.00 as of\nSeptember 2006).  One of his credit reports (ex. 6) reports a zero balance, and\nApplicant corroborated his pay-down of his listed back child support with his post-\nhearing submission.  An admitted financial activity report reflects a significant pay-down,\nand only $57.85 owing as of February 2008 (see ex. A).  Based on Applicant\u2019s payment\nassurances (R.T., at 27-28 and his documented support, Applicant\u2019s payment claims\ncovering creditor 1.f are accepted.  \nBy contrast, Applicant has not been able to make any tangible progress in\nresolving the last two listed debts in the SOR.  He assures he will look into the status of\ncreditor 1.g\u2019s debt (a military allotment he initially established in 1992) and 1.h\u2019s debt\n(his IRS debt), and pay any remaining amounts owing on these two debts (see ex. 6;\nR.T., at 44-45).  To date, though, he has not provided any documented repayment plans\nor initiatives.  Nor he has sought or obtained financial counseling.\nApplicant nets $2,000.00 in monthly income (R.T., at 48-49).  He currently has a\nmonthly remainder after expense deductions of around $173.00 (R.T., at 54). \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines\nrequire the judge to consider all of the \u201cConditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \u201cMitigating\nConditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial,\ncommon-sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\n\n5\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common-sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversarial proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take into account cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an electronics technician for a defense contractor who accumulated\na number of delinquent debts (consumer, student loan, child support, and tax liability)\nfollowing his separation from the U.S. Army in 2000.  Most of his listed delinquent\naccounts and continue remain unresolved.  Absent documented discharge or payment\ninitiatives with the listed creditors, these debts raise security significant concerns.  \n In Applicant\u2019s case, his still outstanding delinquent debts and his failure to\ndocument the debts he disputes or has paid warrant the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 19 (a)\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC 19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d These disqualifying conditions cover the core concern of AG \u00b6\n18: poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\n\n6\nregulations, which, both individually and collectively, can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s accumulated dents are attributable in part to immaturity and living\nbeyond his means during his two marriages.  His situation presented does not\ndemonstrate extenuating circumstances sufficient to warrant application of MC 20 (b),\n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d of AG \u00b6 18.\nWith the exception of his satisfied back child-support obligations, none of\nApplicant\u2019s covered debts are documented to have been paid.  Several of them,\nhowever, are quite old.  Of this group of debts, two appear to be covered by his state\u2019s\nstatute of limitations: specifically, creditors 1.c and 1.e.  The state statute of limitations\nin Applicant\u2019s state for claims based on a written contract is four years See\n16.004(a)(3) of T Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16.051 (statute of limitations for\ncontracts and claims not otherwise provided for) and 16.004(a)(3) (statute of limitations\nfor debts).  Applicant\u2019s listed debts with creditors 1.c and 1.e all appear to covered by\nthe State\u2019s statute of limitations, and are treated, as such, herein as debts that are\nlimitations barred.  \nWhile potentially applicable statutes of limitation have not been recognized by\nour Appeal Board to absorb security risks associated with unresolved delinquent debts.\nStatutes of limitation in general are considered important policy tools for discouraging\nplaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation.  They have never\nbeen equated with good-faith efforts, though, to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020,\nat 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001). \nWeight, if any, to be assigned to potentially applicable statutes of limitations\nunder the new Guidelines should be considered in light of all the circumstances\nsurrounding the existing debts, and must take account of the Applicant\u2019s entire history\nof demonstrated trust and responsibility. Viewed in this whole person light, the\ncontrolling state statute of limitations for written contracts and debts are entitled to be\naccorded significant mitigation weight in evaluating Applicant\u2019s overall financial risk with\nrespect to these specifically covered debts. \n                                                        \nBased on Applicant\u2019s afforded reliance on his State\u2019s four-year statute of\nlimitation to avert enforcement risk with respect to his accorded limitation-barred debts,\nmitigation credit is available to Applicant  By virtue of the age and non-enforcement\nstatus of the debts (only creditors 1.c and 1.e), MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d has applicability to these specific limitation-barred debts.  \n\n7\nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s remaining unresolved debts, mitigation credit is only\npartially available based on his proofs.  Without any documentation of his payment\nefforts and disputes concerning most of these debts (i.e., creditors 1.a and 1.b, creditor\n1.d, and creditors 1.g and 1.h), important corroboration is lacking.  And while the\nAppeal Board has never held the lack of corroboration to be dispositive when\nassessing debt disputes (see ISCR Case No. 02-03186 (App. Bd. Feb. 2006)), it has\ncertainly considered it an important factor in evaluating the intrinsic reliability or weight\nof evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 01 -02677 (App. Bd. October 2002).  Not helpful\neither to Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts is his lack of any demonstrable steps to seek\nfinancial counseling. \nWithout more documented information to demonstrate he is addressing his\nlisted debts and making use of financial counseling, he cannot safely mitigate all of the\nGovernment\u2019s financial concerns.  Only Applicant\u2019s back child support obligations are\nadequately documented and entitled to mitigation treatment.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations is insufficient to enable\nApplicant to surmount security concerns independent of the express disqualifying\nconditions covered by AG\u00b6 18.  Without more to demonstrate progress in resolving his\nremaining debts, it is difficult to draw convincing conclusions about his overall\ntrustworthiness based on factors not covered in the mitigation conditions of the\nguideline for financial considerations.   \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nunsatisfied debts and overall presentation of payment histories, Applicant does not\nmitigate security concerns related to his still outstanding debts.  Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a,\n1.b, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h of the SOR.  By contrast, favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to sub-paragraphs 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\n\n8\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT   \nSub-para. 1.a:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 21, \n2006. On July 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department \nof Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant=s receipt for the SOR is dated July 13, 2007. He answered the SOR in \nwriting on August 6, 2007, and requested his case be decided on the written record in lieu \nof a hearing.  \n \n \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 26, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nOn December 11, 2007, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written \ncase.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the \nApplicant. He was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file on December 17, 2007.  Applicant did \nnot file a response to the FORM within the 30 day time allowed that would have expired on \nJanuary 16, 2008. I received the case assignment on March 13, 2008. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in && 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d of the SOR, with explanations. \n \nApplicant is 30 years old, married, and works for a defense contractor. (Item 5) \n \nApplicant admits he owes $109 to a debt collector for a telephone bill.  Applicant \nadmits he owes $9,083 to a bank on a credit card debt.  He also admits he owes $8,718 to \nanother credit card company.  Lastly, Applicant admits he owes $37,874 to another bank \non a credit card debt.  Applicant sent letters to each collector or creditor in 2006 and 2007, \nseeking Avalidation@ of these debts, but has not paid any of these delinquent debts.  (Items \n4, 6, 7, 8) \n \nApplicant=s Answer refers to a cost of living increase, his real estate taxes \nincreasing, and his home remodeling business failing in 2005.  He provides no explanation \nof these statements, or supporting documentation to show the context within which he did \nnot repay the delinquent debts listed in the SOR. (Item 4) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative \njudge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG & 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole \nperson concept.@ The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk \nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG \n& 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly \nunder AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security \nconcerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt.  He has not paid them, and \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \noffers no reasonable, good-faith explanation as to why he has not paid these debts listed in \nthe SOR.  Merely sending response letters to creditors without negotiating a settlement, \narranging installment payments, or paying the debts in full, shows an unwillingness to pay \nhis debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring a closer examination. \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where \nAthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or \na death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.@ Applicant hints at a business downturn in his Answer, but does not explain \nwhat he means.  Nor does he explain what Acost of living increases@ he blames for his \ninability to repay these debts.  Neither does he explain how the debts arose from his \nbusiness, or if they came from his personal spending habits.  The burden of proof is on him \nto show that the mitigating conditions should apply to him.  He failed in this burden.  I do \nnot find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case.  There \nare no other mitigating conditions which could apply under these facts.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant=s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): A(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of \nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recentcy of the conduct; (4) the individual=s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; \nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.@ Under AG & 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole \nperson concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. It is unclear from Applicant=s answer when \nand how his financial problems arose, and what were the basis for these debts which are \nnow delinquent. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) Applicant does not explain in any detail how his debts \noccurred, what efforts he made to repay them, or avoid such problems in the future. (See \nAG & 2(a)(2).)  Applicant provided no information concerning efforts to repay the debts or \nbehavioral changes to remedy the situation.  Applicant owes about $56,000 and refuses to \nmake good-faith efforts to repay these debts.  He has not repaid even the $109 phone bill. \n(See AG & 2(a)(6).)  The potential for coercion, exploitation or duress exists because of the \nsize of the debt, which will affect his credit ratings, thereby causing him to take advantage \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nof any method to extricate himself from this predicament, including coercive methods by \nother persons. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) Applicant voluntarily entered into these debts, and it is \nlikely he will continue in his refusal to repay them. (See AG & 2(a)(5) and (9).) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as to \nApplicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S.

The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJune 19, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have the case decided on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing.1 On March 3, 2008, Department Counsel \nprepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing ten Items, and mailed \nApplicant a complete copy on March 6, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on March \n18, 2008, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional \ninformation. Applicant did not submit any additional evidence. DOHA assigned the case \nto me on May 27, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. He denied the \nallegation contained in \u00b6 1.a. \n   \n \nApplicant is 38 years old and divorced. From April 2003 to the present, he has \nworked as a coater/finisher for a federal contractor. In July 2006, he submitted a SF 86. \n(Item 4). \n \n \nIn October 1988, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. He served until May \n1994, when he was involuntarily separated by the Air Force because of two alcohol-\nrelated incidents. On September 19, 1993, he was arrested on a military base by base \nsecurity police and charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), and \n(2) Failure to Obey a Lawful Order. His blood alcohol content registered 19%. He was \nreprimanded and scheduled to attend a Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Training \nProgram. On March 5, 1994, the base security police arrested him again for (1) Driving \nWhile Driving Privileges Revoked and (2) DUI. He received an Article 15 hearing under \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and sentenced to be reduced to the grade \nof airman first class, and forfeit $250 of his monthly pay for two months. In May 1994, \nthe Department of Air Force recommended that he be discharged due to his inability to \nmeet standards, probation and rehabilitation. On May 5, 1994, he was discharged due \nto misconduct and received a General Discharge. (Item 10). \n \n \nOn February 21, 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving \nUnder Suspension, (2) Driving Without Lights, and (3) Open Container. The court found \nhim guilty of Count 3 and he forfeited his bond. The two other counts were nolle \nprossed.  \n \n \nOn May 29, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) DUI, (2) Loud \nMusic, (3) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol Less Safe, and (4) Driving Under the \nInfluence and Blood Alcohol Content .08% or More.  The court found that the initial stop \nby the police was improper and the evidence was suppressed. The district attorney \ndismissed the charges against him. \n \n \n                                                          \n1The Answer is undated.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant started consuming alcohol at the age of 13 and continued through high \nschool. During an April 2007 investigative interview, he asserted that he usually \nconsumes one to three cognac drinks on weekend evenings. He stated he does not \ndrink and drive. He voluntarily attended one alcohol awareness class, the date of which \nis unknown. He has been intoxicated two or three times in his life. He does not believe \nthat he has an alcohol problem. (GE 5). He provided little evidence of mitigation, despite \nopportunities to do so. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate \nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the Government\u2019s security concern pertaining to alcohol \nconsumption:  \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a)-(g) describe seven Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions \nthat may be applicable to security concerns raised under this guideline. Applicant \nadmitted the three DUI arrests and another alcohol related arrest alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.e. Based on his admissions and other record evidence, the Government \nraised AG \u00b6 22 (a), which is applicable when there is evidence of \u201calcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern regardless of whether \nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d Applicant \ndenied that he consumed alcohol to excess and to the point of intoxication from 1983 to \n2007, as alleged in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR.  After reviewing the file, I find that there is \ninsufficient evidence to support that allegation.  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition and \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n23 (a)-(d): \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nOne of the mitigating conditions has some application to the facts in this case. \nApplicant was arrested in 1993, 1994, 1996, and May 2005. Given that the last incident \noccurred three years ago and nine years after the previous incident, sufficient time has \npassed to trigger a limited application of AG \u00b6 23(a). Full application of the condition is \nnot warranted because the 2005 incident was not isolated and four alcohol-related \nincidents in his life, over the span of 12 years, is sufficient to raise questions about his \njudgment. \nApplicant does not believe he has an alcohol problem; hence, AG \u00b6 23(b) is not \napplicable. There is no evidence in the record to support the application of AG \u00b6 23(c), \nor AG \u00b6 23(d) that requires participation in a formal alcohol rehabilitation program, \nrather than a brief educational experience.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each \nguideline, the adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all \navailable, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate \nvariables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. In evaluating the \nconduct of the applicant, the administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 38-year-old man, who \nbegan voluntarily consuming alcohol when he was 13 years old, continued throughout \nhigh school, and into his adult life. Early in his military career, he abused alcohol on two \noccasions, which resulted in his involuntary separation. This milestone event apparently \nwas not enough to raise Appellant\u2019s awareness of the negative effect alcohol was \nhaving on his life, as he was subsequently involved in alcohol-related incidents in 1996 \nand 2005.  All of those events raise questions about his judgment. \n \nDespite that history, commencing in 1993 through 2005, Applicant asserted that \nhe does not have an alcohol problem and responsibly consumes alcohol. However, he \ndid not provide any substantive evidence to affirm his statements, although he was \ngiven additional time to do so. Absent independent corroboration, such as an evaluation \nfrom an appropriately credentialed health care provider or other sources, documenting \nApplicant\u2019s assertions that he does not have an alcohol issue, I am concerned that there \nis a strong likelihood that he continues to abuse alcohol or will in the future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 24, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On October\n22, 2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Joseph Testan denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because (a)\ncertain of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are erroneous, (b) the Judge\u2019s conclusions are inconsistent and\ncontain errors, and (c) the Judge misapplied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions.

Applicant was born and raised\nin Turkey. From 1983 to 1992, he worked at a Turkish university.  Sometime after that, he moved\nto the United States. He became a United States citizen and was issued a United States passport in\n2000.  He considers himself a dual citizen.\nApplicant served on active duty with the Turkish military for approximately 16 months in\nthe early 1980s.  From the time of his discharge from active duty until early 2005, he was on reserve\nstatus with the Turkish military.  For a little less than a year in the mid-1990s, applicant worked for\nthe Turkish government while he was living in the United States.  Since 2004, applicant has received\nabout $400.00 per month in social security retirement from the Turkish government.  He must\nmaintain his Turkish citizenship in order to continue receiving this payment.  In 2000, after he\nbecame a United States citizen, and again in 2005, applicant used his Turkish passport to enter and\nexit Turkey.  He returned his Turkish passport to the Turkish government earlier this year.\nApplicant\u2019s wife, to whom he has been married since 1982, was born in Turkey and is a\nnaturalized United States citizen.  They have two children, both of whom are dual citizens of Turkey\nand the United States.  Their oldest child was born in Turkey and became a naturalized U.S. citizen\nat the same time Applicant and his wife did.  His youngest child was born in the United States.\nApplicant applied for and received Turkish citizenship for this child in the 1990s.  Applicant\u2019s\nmother, brother, brother-in-law and his wife, and parents-in-law, are citizens and residents of Turkey.\n\n3\nApplicant speaks to his mother once or twice a month, and communicates with his brother weekly\nby email and monthly by telephone.  He provides financial support to both of them.\nTurkey is a constitutional republic with a multi-party parliamentary system and a president\nwith limited powers. It has a population of about 70.5 million and is a member of NATO.  United\nStates-Turkish relations focus on areas such as strategic energy cooperation, trade and investment,\nsecurity ties, regional stability, and the global war on terrorism.  Terrorist bombings over the past\nfive years have struck religious, government, government-owned, political, tourist and business\ntargets in a number of locations in Turkey. A variety of leftist or Islamic terrorist groups have\ntargeted U.S. and Western interests as well.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607,\n620, (1966).\nWe have considered the challenged material findings in light of the record and conclude that\nthey are based on substantial evidence.  To the extent that there is error in the Judge\u2019s findings, we\nconclude that it is harmless.  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings with respect to his circumstances of security concern do not reflect a reasonable\nor plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the\nJudge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401\n(9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents evidence raising\nth\nsecurity concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The\napplication of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application\nrequires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions\nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant elected to have his case decided upon the written record.  As a result, the Judge\ndid not have an opportunity to question Applicant about his concerns and evaluate Applicant\u2019s\ncredibility in the context of a hearing.  Moreover, Applicant did not submit a response to the\ngovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM).  Applicant has not met his burden of\n\n4\ndemonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding that the Guideline B and Guideline C allegations\nhad not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s decision, he has not\nestablished that it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn his decision, the Judge weighed the evidence, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating factors.  He reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient\nto overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17714 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Board does not review a case de\nnovo.   After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant\nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection\nbetween the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United states v.\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines Inc. v\nUnited States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted\nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Le\u2019i, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n October 22, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines B and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn May 7, 2008, applicant answered the SOR in writing, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 19, 2008. Applicant did not submit a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on September 15, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was born and raised in Turkey. From 1983 to July 1992, he worked at a\nTurkish university. Sometime after that, he moved to the United States. He became a\nUnited States citizen and was issued a United States passport in 2000. He considers\nhimself a dual citizen.\nApplicant served on active duty with the Turkish military for approximately 16\nmonths in the early 1980s. From the time of his discharge from active duty until early\n2005, he was on reserve status with the Turkish military.\nFor a little less than a year in the mid-1990s, applicant worked for the Turkish\ngovernment while he was living in the United States.\nSince 2004, applicant has received about $400.00 per month in social security\nretirement from the Turkish government. He must maintain his Turkish citizenship in\norder to continue receiving this payment.\nIn 2000, after he became a United States citizen, and again in 2005, applicant\nused his Turkish passport to enter and exit Turkey. He returned his Turkish passport to\nthe Turkish government earlier this year.\nApplicant\u2019s wife, to whom he has been married since 1982, was born in Turkey\nand is a naturalized United States citizen. They have two children, both of whom are\ndual citizens of Turkey and the United States. Their oldest child was born in Turkey and\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen at the same time applicant and his wife did. His\nyoungest child was born in the United States. Applicant applied for and received Turkish\ncitizenship for this child in the 1990s.\nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, brother-in-law and his wife, and parents-in-law, are\ncitizens and residents of Turkey. Applicant speaks to his mother once or twice a month,\nand communicates with his brother weekly by email and monthly by telephone. He\nprovides financial support to both of them.\nThe Government offered four official United States publications with the FORM\nthat provide relevant facts about Turkey. The Government requested that these\ndocuments be admitted into evidence. I have admitted the documents into evidence,\nand I take administrative notice of the following facts found therein:\nTurkey is a constitutional republic with a multi-party parliamentary system and a\npresident with limited powers. It has a population of about 70.5 million and is a member\nof NATO. United States-Turkish relations focus on areas such as strategic energy\ncooperation, trade and investment, security ties, regional stability, and the global war on\nterrorism. \n\n3\nTerrorist bombings over the past five years have stuck religious, government,\ngovernment-owned, political, tourist and business targets in a number of locations in\nTurkey. A variety of leftist or Islamic terrorist groups have targeted U.S. and Western\ninterests as well.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\n\n4\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Lastly, under Paragraph 7.i., \u201cconduct,\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d\nmay be disqualifying.\nApplicant has at minimum monthly contact with his mother and weekly contact\nwith his brother, both of whom are citizens and residents of Turkey. In addition, since\nbecoming a United States citizen in 2000, he has visited Turkey at least twice.\nApplicant\u2019s presence in Turkey during these trips made him and his family members\npotentially vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by the Turkish government.\nThese facts raise concerns under all three disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 8.a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph 8.b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph 8.c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. Applicant*s contacts\nwith his mother and brother in Turkey are frequent and ongoing. His relationship with\nthem is close, raising the concern that these relationships create a risk for foreign\n\n5\ninfluence or exploitation. Applicant failed to provide sufficient credible evidence that it is\nunlikely he would be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign government and the interests of the United States, or that he is not vulnerable to\na conflict of interest.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Preference guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 9 of the AG, and is as follows:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nParagraph 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 10 a.1., exercising any right or privilege of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member may be disqualifying. Applicant possessed and used a Turkish passport\nafter becoming a United States citizen, and he continues to receive retirement benefits\nfrom the Turkish government. Accordingly, this disqualifying condition applies. Under\nParagraph 10. c., \u201cperforming or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as\nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or government in conflict\nwith the national security interest\u201d may be disqualifying. And, under Paragraph 10.d,\n\u201cany statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than the United\nStates\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s service in the Turkish military, and his\nemployment with the Turkish government in the 1990s while living in the United States,\nrequires application of these two disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 11 describes potentially mitigating conditions. Under Paragraph 11.c.,\nit may be mitigating if the \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign\ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual\nwas a minor.\u201d Applicant\u2019s active duty military service and his employment with the\nTurkish government occurred before he became a United States citizen. On the other\nhand, he served in the Turkish military reserves and possessed and used a Turkish\npassport after he became a United States citizen, and he received, and continues to\nreceive, retirement benefits from the Turkish government. This mitigating condition\napplies in part. Under Paragraph 11.e., it may be mitigating if the \u201c[foreign] passport has\nbeen destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d\nApplicant surrendered his Turkish passport to the Turkish government. Accordingly, this\nmitigating condition is applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph 2.a:\n\n6\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2.c., the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant was born and raised in Turkey. After performing his mandatory active\nduty service in the Turkish military, he worked for about ten years at a Turkish\nuniversity. He then moved to the United States, becoming a U.S. citizen in 2000.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct since moving to the United States has not evidenced an\nunequivocal preference for the United States. Even after he became a U.S. citizen, he\ncontinued on reserve status with the Turkish military, and he continues to receive\nretirement benefits from the Turkish government. And, although he obtained U.S.\ncitizenship for himself, wife and oldest child, he went out of his way to obtain Turkish\ncitizenship for his youngest child, who was born in the United States. Perhaps most\nimportantly, he has made no definitive statement concerning his plans for the future,\nand has offered little to no evidence indicating he has any significant ties to his\ncommunity or to any United States citizens other than his wife and children. Given these\nfacts, and the fact the rest of his and his wife\u2019s immediate family members are citizens\nand residents of Turkey, too much uncertainty exists regarding applicant\u2019s true\npreferences and future intentions to safely conclude it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to allow him access to classified information. \nAlthough I have considered the fact that Turkey and the United States are allies,\nthis fact is not determinative. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting\nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is\nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or\ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States. ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at\n5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  It is a known fact that friendly nations and allies have\nengaged in espionage against the United States.\nI have carefully reviewed the administrative record, applicant*s submissions, and\nthe allegations in the SOR. I have weighed the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of\nGuidelines B and C, and I have evaluated applicant*s conduct in light of the whole\nperson concept identified at Paragraph E2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive. After doing\nso, I conclude that applicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s case under Guidelines B\nand C.\n\n7\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMay 8, 2008\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on April 14, 2006\n(Government Exhibit 1).  On October 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines J and E concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on November 7, 2007, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on January 7, 2008.  I received the case assignment on January 9, 2008.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 6, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on February 25, 2008.  The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\n\n2\nthrough 4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G, without objection.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing on March 5, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 45, single and has an Associate of Science degree in\nAdministration of Justice.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Laboratory\nTechnician and seeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection\nwith his employment.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Applicant has been arrested twice.  The first arrest happened in February\n22, 2002.  On that occasion the Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol and Driving With a Blood Alcohol Level above .08%.  He plead no contest to\na reduced charge of Reckless Driving and received a suspended sentence for 36\nmonths, fines and ordered to attend a six month first offender alcohol education and\ncounseling program.  The Applicant successfully completed all the sentence\nrequirements and has had no further alcohol related incidents.  \nThe Applicant submits that this arrest is an aberration.  This incident occurred\nduring a very tumultuous time in the Applicant\u2019s life.  Both of his grandparents had died\nwithin a week of each other in September 2001; he had been offered employment with\nhis current company on October 31, 2001; he was terminated from his then employer on\nNovember 5, 2001; and he had been informed on the day of his arrest of the\nforthcoming date of his divorce from his first wife.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits E and F; Transcript at 65-70, 78-80.) \nThe Applicant\u2019s second arrest occurred on October 28, 2004.  In the 1990s the\nApplicant had worked in a gun store and also was a Reserve Police Officer.  He had\nconsiderable knowledge and training in the proper use of weapons.  During that time he\nhad acquired a large collection of weapons, worth between $80,000.00 and\n$100,000.00.  All of the approximately 58 weapons had been acquired legally.  Nine of\nthese weapons were subsequently classified as assault weapons and, as such, had to\nbe registered or surrendered.  The Applicant did neither.  In addition, another one of his\nweapons had been altered so that it was legally viewed as a machine gun.\nThe evidence is mixed and somewhat contradictory as to what happened on the\nday in question.  After reviewing all the available evidence, including the police report,\nthe Applicant\u2019s testimony and the Report of Investigation, I make the following findings\nof fact.  The Applicant, while attempting to clear a jammed round in one of his rifles,\nshot out a street light in a neighboring lot.  Given the Applicant\u2019s knowledge of weapons,\nand weapons safety, this was at the very least a negligent act on his part.  The police\n\n3\nwere called to his location because of the shot and, during the investigation, confiscated\nall of his weapons.  The Applicant initially denied any knowledge of the incident, but\neventually admitted it.\nThe Applicant was subsequently charged with several felonies, including one\ncount \nof \nDischarging \na \nWeapon \nin \nPublic, \none \ncount \nof \nUnlawful\nPossession/Transportation of a Machine Gun, and nine counts of Unlawful Possession\nof an Assault Weapon.  On March 10, 2005, he pled nolo contendere to two\nmisdemeanor counts, one count of Discharging a Firearm in Public and one count of\nUnlawful Possession of an Assault Weapon.  He was sentenced to 60 days in jail, with\ntwo days credit and allowed to substitute community service for the remaining days.  He\nwas also put on 36 months informal probation; fined approximately $5,000.00; all of his\nweapons were confiscated and destroyed; and he was prohibited from possessing\nfirearms.  The Applicant\u2019s probation was due to end two weeks after the hearing.  The\nApplicant testified that, while the Court ordered him not to possess firearms, he also has\nno desire to possess or shoot them in the future, because of the turmoil owning\nweapons has caused him to have in his life.  (Government Exhibits 1 and 2; Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit G; Transcript at 46-65, 80-88, 94-95).  \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nUnder subparagraph 2.a., the Government alleges that the Applicant\u2019s conduct\nset forth in Paragraph 1, above, has independent validity under this Guideline.\nSpecifically, that his conduct shows questionable judgement and/or dishonesty that\nraises questions about the Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  The facts set forth under Paragraph 1, above, will also be\nconsidered under this Guideline.  \nSubparagraph 2.b. concerns the Applicant\u2019s termination from employment in\nNovember 2001.  The circumstances of his termination are subject to some debate\nsince he had just been offered a job by his current employer days before he was let go.\nUnder the facts of this case, I find that the Government has not shown that the\nApplicant\u2019s termination shows poor judgment on his part.  This subparagraph is found\nfor the Applicant.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 1, Transcript at 72-76.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly\nrespected person and employee.  Several friends and work associates submitted letters\non his behalf to the Court in 2004.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  The Applicant is described\nas someone who is \u201cgenuine,\u201d \u201cresourceful,\u201d and \u201ca solid citizen.\u201d  He has received\nseveral certificates of recognition and spot awards during his current employment.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 7-12.)\n\n4\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant was involved in criminal incidents in 2002 and 2004.  The 2004\nincident involved firearms and is, therefore, a serious crime.  AG \u00b6 31(a) applies to this\ncase, stating that a disqualifying condition is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b631(d) applies because, as of the date of the hearing, the\nApplicant was still on probation for another two weeks.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, several of the mitigating conditions also\napply and justify a finding for the Applicant as to this Guideline.  They are AG \u00b6 32(a ),\n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d; and AG \u00b6 32(b), \u201cthere is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d\nIt is clear from the evidence that these two incidents were aberrations for the\nApplicant.  In looking at this case I have considered the Applicant\u2019s background as a\nReserve Police Officer and his knowledge of weapons safety.  His conduct was\nnegligent and could have been dangerous.  However, he has accepted his punishment\nfor both offenses, been forthcoming with the Government on every opportunity and\nexpresses a credible intent not to engage in such conduct in the future.  The Applicant\ndid not attempt to justify his conduct, but rather accepted the fact that, on those\noccasions, he exhibited extremely poor judgment.  The Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity significance of his criminal conduct and Paragraph 1 is therefore found for the\nApplicant. \n\n6\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns, one of\nwhich is arguably applicable here. Under AG & 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in\nseveral adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under\nany other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information,\u201d may be\ndisqualifying.  The Applicant has a criminal arrest history which includes a weapons\nrelated conviction.  The evidence is sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying\ncondition, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from personal conduct involving questionable judgment. Under AG \u00b6\n17(c), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where \u201cthe offense is so minor, so\nmuch time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and 17(d), \u201cthe individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur.\u201d\nAs stated above under Paragraph J, these two incidents were an aberration for\nthe Applicant.  While he has been on probation for the last offense, he has made\nchanges in his life and matured a great deal.  He understands and appreciates how his\nconduct endangered others, and reflected poorly upon himself.  The evidence shows\nthat the Applicant has reformed and that such acts will not occur in the future.\nParagraph 2 is found for the Applicant.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\n\n7\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional person who has overcome his earlier criminal conduct.  In\nviewing all the facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has mitigated the security\nsignificance of his prior conduct.  As set forth at length above, I find that there have\nbeen permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  In addition, I find that there is\nlittle to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and\nthat the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct and personal conduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor the Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Due to her husband\u2019s loss of\nunemployment and low paying jobs, Applicant accumulated delinquent debt. Her financial\ndifficulties were exacerbated by separation and divorce. Applicant supports her adult two sons who\nare not working. Applicant paid her four delinquent debts using inheritance money in September\n2007. Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations concern.  Clearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated February 5, 2007).\n2\nTr. 68.\n3\nTr. 40.\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On September 19, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on\nOctober 12, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on November 13, 2007. I scheduled a hearing for December 11, 2007.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 11, 2007 to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-4) were admitted. Testimony was taken from Applicant. Applicant\u2019s\nexhibits (AE A-M) were admitted. The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 19, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted she once owed the creditors listed in the SOR, but denied the truth of the\nfactual allegations set forth in the SOR pertaining to financial considerations under Guideline F\n(subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d.) because the debts are paid. Those admissions are incorporated as\nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the\nfollowing additional finding of fact:\nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from high school\nin 1967. Applicant has been with her current employer since 1996 and has maintained a security\nclearance with no problems.  She completed a security clearance application on February 6, 2007.\n2\nApplicant married in September 1978. As a result of that marriage she has two sons. Her\nhusband lost his job as a systems analyst in the mid 1990's. According to Applicant, he was out of\nwork for more than two and a half years.  He was finally able to find a very low paying job.\n3\nApplicant stayed at home with her sons until they started elementary school. She volunteered in a\nschool and then did some substitute teaching. Although she was employed occasionally, she did not\nearn sufficient income to support the family and they began to accumulate debt.4\nIn 1996, Applicant started a temporary, full time position with her current company. In  1999,\nApplicant was diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy (MS). She states that it is a mild case, although\n\nTr. 43.\n5\nTr. 47.\n6\nGE 2(Credit report, dated February 6, 2007).\n7\nAE B; C; and D (Printout of Pay and Personal Financial Statement).\n8\nTr. 45.\n9\n3\nshe wears an ankle brace to aid her walking. Her physician ordered a shot of Avonex as treatment.\nShe stopped taking the shots because she could not afford them. She also decided that she did not\nreally need them. \nIn 2000, Applicant and her husband separated. At that time, she and her adult sons went to\nlive with her aunt who had a large home and property.  Her sons did not graduate from high school\nand continue to have difficulty finding employment with limited skills. They live with Applicant and\nshe supports them. In 2001, when Applicant divorced, she was reduced to one small income.5\nApplicant acknowledges that she used credit cards to help pay for items. When her television\nstopped working, she replaced it but only paid on it for a while before she realized that she did not\nhave enough money to cover basic expenses. She admits using credit cards and taking out two loans\nto help pay the bills. She regrets using credit cards and vows never to accumulate debt again.6\nApplicant\u2019s aunt died in November 2000. Another aunt died in 2003. At that time, Applicant\nwas to inherit half of the property and estate.  The family could not decide whether they wanted to\nkeep the property or sell it. This unresolved situation lingered for a few years. Applicant anticipated\nthe estate would be settled by 2005, but in the interim she was getting into debt with loans she\nobtained to help pay her bills.  Her collection accounts began in late 2004-2005.  \n7\nThe status of Applicant\u2019s  alleged debts as listed  in the SOR is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Account/Amount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nCollection account     $1,051\nPaid\nAE L\n1.b\nCollection account     $7,691\nPaid\nAE G\n1.c\nCollection account     $   358\nPaid\nAE K\n1.d\nCollection account     $9,993\nSettled\nAE M; AE F\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $700 to 800.

In her current job there are wage increases each year. She is starting to save some\nmoney. She is current on her rent and has no car payments.

Dec. 19, 2002).\n17\n4\nIn August 2007, the inherited property was finally auctioned. Applicant received her half of\nthe distribution from the property.  She received approximately $71,000. She began to pay her debts\n10\nimmediately from that money. By September 25, 2007, all SOR debts were paid.  She has\n11\napproximately $28,000 left from the inheritance in her savings account.\nApplicant sought financial advice from two friends. Although they are not trained financial\ncounselors, they were helping Applicant with managing her money. The one friend is also her\nlandlord who was also advising her about investing her money. However, Applicant did not want\nto invest any money before she paid all her debts.    \n12\nApplicant has been employed with her current employer for almost 15 years. During that time\nshe has been involved with documents and security control. She has received various awards. She\nhas maintained her security clearance since 1993 with no problems. Applicant became a facility\nsecurity office last August. She needs a security clearance for that position. Her supervisor describes\nApplicant as a person of character. He would not hesitate to employ her. Several co-workers describe\nApplicant as loyal, well-rounded, and very likeable. One colleague describes Applicant as one of the\nmost honest, reliable people he knows. Several supervisors and co-workers praise her loyalty,\nprofessionalism, composure, and financial management.13\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n14\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n15\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n16\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n17\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\n\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n18\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n19\nAG \u00b618.\n20\n5\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n18\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n19\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n20\nApplicant\u2019s  delinquent debts totaling approximately $19,500 is not disputed. Thus, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC 19(c)  (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. Her admissions and credit\nreports confirm the delinquent debts, and document her debt history.\nApplicant used credit to purchase items that she could not afford and to help provide for her\nadult sons after her divorce. She admits that she probably should not have replaced her television\nwhen it ceased to work. She could have purchased a less expensive television as a replacement.  FC\nDC 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive\nindebtedness, significant cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis)\npartially applies.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\n\nSee ISCR 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FC MC 6 for\n21\ndebts resolved through garnishment).\n6\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nAlthough FC MC 20 (a) does not provide a temporal or specific definition of what constitutes\n\u201crecent\u201d conduct, Applicant\u2019s overall conduct with creditors does not cast doubt on her current\nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. She has shown sufficient unusual circumstances to\nestablish that her financial problems are \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201dApplicant\u2019s separation and divorce after\nyears of her husband\u2019s unemployment exacerbated her financial difficulties. She was determined to\nsupport her adult sons who live with her because they are not working. Her delinquent debts occurred\nin period of time from late 2004-2005. She has continued to work and be responsible. As soon as\nshe received her inheritance she paid all her debts. I find that FC MC 20(a) is partially applicable.\nFC MC 20(b) is applicable for the reasons stated above.  \n21\nApplicant has not received formal financial counseling. She has sought the advice of her\nlandlord and friends. She has paid all the debts that were delinquent and is in a stable job. FC MC\n20 (c) applies due to the resolution of the debts. There are clear indications that the problem is under\ncontrol.\nFC MC 20(d) is applicable because Applicant immediately paid her delinquent creditors\nwhen she received the inheritance. She is current on all her other accounts and expenses. \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant has a long history of solid employment with her company. She is described as an\nhonest, trustworthy, reliable and capable person. She has held a security clearance since 1996. She\ndivorced in 2001 and supported her two sons with her income. After her husband\u2019s unemployment\nand loss of pay, Applicant began to accumulate debt. She did the best she could. She acknowledges\nthat the use of credit cards to finance her lifestyle was a mistake. She is now aware of the\nconsequences of using credit. She immediately paid her debts as soon as she received the inheritance.\nShe believed the estate would be settled shortly after 2003, but due to family conflicts about the sale\nof the property that did not occur. She was candid and forthright at her hearing. She presented\ndocumentation in an organized fashion. Her references all attest to her loyalty and reliability. She\n\n7\nwas credible in her resolve to handle her future financial situation.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on September\n12, 2006. On September 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 15, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on October 22,\n2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 16, 2007, and I\nreceived the case assignment on November 19, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non November 21, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 12,\n2007. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were received without\nJanuary 9, 2008\n\n2\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through J,\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 19,\n2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR subparagraphs\n1.a and 1.b. He denied the factual allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d. He\nalso provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance.  \nApplicant is a 33-year-old married man with one child, age five. He is an\nelectrical engineer who has been working for his current employer for two years. He\nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1998. His employer granted him an outstanding\nperformance award for 2007 (Exhibit G).\nBetween 2001 and 2006, Applicant accrued approximately $40,000 of delinquent\ndebt. Before this period, he had no trouble paying his bills. In mid-2001, however, he\nwas laid off (Exhibit 1 at 5). For the next five years, he was either unemployed, or\nunderemployed (see generally, Exhibit 1 at 4, Tr. 41). Unable to make ends meet, he\nbecame overly reliant upon credit cards.\nIn approximately 2005, Applicant decided to increase his job prospects by\nenrolling in graduate school. In September 2006, he graduated, earning a master\u2019s\ndegree in electrical engineering. Shortly thereafter, his current employer hired him.\nOnce Applicant\u2019s finances began to stabilize, he began confronting his\ndelinquencies. In October 2007, he contacted the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph\n1.a, and negotiated a settlement agreement (Exhibit A). Under the agreement, he will\npay the creditor $6,540 in increments consisting of a $1,500 initial payment followed by\nsuccessive $250 monthly payments (Id.). He has made the first three payments, as\nagreed (Exhibits H and I).\nSOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.d constitute the same delinquency. It was\nassigned to the collection agent listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d and later transferred to\nthe collection agent listed in subparagraph 1.b (Exhibits C and E). Through a settlement\nagreement, Applicant paid the creditor $1,000 in October 2007, and $250 the next\nmonth (Exhibit J). He will continue to make $250 monthly payments until the debt is\nsatisfied.\nIn approximately September 2007, Applicant contacted the creditor listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.c. In response, a representative of the creditor informed him the\naccount was no longer in its possession (Exhibit B). Using the forwarding information\nprovided by the representative, Applicant contacted the new collection agent. It did not\nhave any information about the debt (Tr. 30). \n\n3\nApplicant currently earns $68,000 per year (Tr. 38). During the three previous\nyears, he earned, on average, $25,000 per year (Tr. 42). Since finishing graduate\nschool, Applicant has moved to a smaller, less expensive home. In doing so, he\ndecreased his monthly expenses by $200. Also, his wife took a part-time job in an effort\nto assist with the family finances. He has $500 remaining each month after expenses\nhave been paid (Tr. 39).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n4\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several potentially disqualifying conditions. Here, the\napplicable ones are AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ AG &\n19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nThe guideline also lists several potentially mitigating conditions, addressing\namong other things, the cause of the indebtedness, any efforts toward debt resolution,\nand the applicant\u2019s current financial status. Here, Applicant\u2019s financial problems did not\nbegin until he was laid off in 2001. After years of unemployment or underemployed, he\nenhanced his job prospects by obtaining a graduate degree, and successfully obtained\na new job. As his finances stabilized, he began contacting creditors. Of his three\nremaining delinquencies, he has been satisfying two with monthly payments for the past\ntwo months. Also, although he has not yet confirmed the identity of the third creditor, he\nhas made good-faith efforts to do so. He has ample monthly income to implement\nanother payment plan.\nThis favorable information triggers the application of AG \u00b6 20(a), Athe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,@ AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d AG & 20(c), Athe person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\n\n5\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,@and AG \u00b6 20(d), the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were not caused by a history of irresponsible spending.\nInstead, they accrued from his inability to support his family after being laid off in 2001.\nHe then made the prudent decision to enhance his job prospects by earning a master\u2019s\ndegree, which led to a stable, well-paying job, as anticipated. He reduced his expenses\nby moving into a smaller, cheaper apartment, and contacted creditors to initiate\npayment plans. His financial situation appears to be well in control. Evaluating this case\nin light of the whole person concept, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcern. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant used and continues to possess a currently valid Iranian passport, which \nhe obtained to facilitate travel to Iran. He visited his aunt living in Iran in 1996, 2003 and \n2005, and communicates with her about once a month. Security concerns pertaining to \nforeign preference and foreign influence are not mitigated. Eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 4, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Item 1). \nOn April 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him (Item 2), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \nOctober 16, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuidelines B (Foreign Influence) and C (Foreign Preference). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 2, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated August 1, 2008, was provided to him, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.2 Applicant did not provide additional documents within the 30 \ndays. On October 10, 2008, the case was assigned to another administrative judge and \non October 15, 2008, the case was transferred to me.    \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel asked me to take administrative notice concerning materials \nrelated to the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran) summarized in an 8-page document entitled \nAdministrative Notice, dated August 1, 2008, as well as the contents of the attachments \nlisted at pages 7-8 (Item 7). The attachments are provided to \u201cprovide elaboration and \ncontext\u201d for the facts in pages 1-7. Id. at 1. Applicant did not object to Department \nCounsel\u2019s request.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Department Counsel\u2019s \nrequest for administrative notice is granted.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n2Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated August 5, 2008; and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated August 12, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant \nthat he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations and provided explanations concerning \nthe security concerns raised in the SOR (Item 4). His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant left Iran in 1976 when he was 16-years-old (Item 4 at 2, Item 5). He has \nlived in the United States for 32 years (Item 4). He is now 48-years-old. He received his \nmasters degree in 1995 (Item 1). He married in 1990 (Items 1, 4). His spouse and his \nson were born in the United States, and are U.S. residents (Item 4). His mother, brother \nand sister are naturalized U.S. citizens (Items 4, 5). He has never served in the U.S. \nmilitary (Item 1). He has not left employment under adverse conditions or been fired in \nthe last seven years (Item 1).  He has no prior felony convictions, offenses involving \nfirearms or explosives, or offenses involving drugs or alcohol (Item 1). He does not use \nillegal drugs (Item 1). He became a U.S. citizen in 1991 (Item 4). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s aunt is a citizen and resident of Iran (SOR \u00b6 1.a). She is 83-years-old \n(Items 4 and 5). She \u201chelped raise [Applicant] as a child, and [he] feels he has a \nresponsibility to help her with her medical problems\u201d (Item 5). He visited his aunt in \n1996, 2003 and 2005 (Item 4). He purchased medicine and other health care products \nfor her (Item 5). She is seriously ill (Item 4). When Applicant went to Iran in 2003, he \nbrought his wife and son along and they visited her (Item 5). When Applicant went to \nIran for about two weeks in 2005, he traveled alone and visited his aunt (Item 5). In \n2005, he purchased a hearing aid for her (Item 5). Her husband died in 2001. He \nspeaks to her about once a month (Items 4 and 5).  Most of his communications with \nher are to check on her health (Item 4). She is not affiliated with the Iranian government \n(Item 5). She is a retired nurse (Item 5). Applicant considers his relationship with his \naunt to be a \u201cclose family relationship\u201d (Item 5 at 2).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response emphasized his strong connections to the United \nStates and his very limited connections to Iran (Item 4). He promised that he would \nresolve any conflict that might develop in favor of the United States.   \n \nIranian Passport \n  \n \nAfter becoming a U.S. citizen in 1991, Applicant renewed his Iranian passport in \n1996 and 2006 (Item 4, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b).  He used his Iranian passport to travel to \nIran in 2003 and 2005 (Item 4, SOR \u00b6 2.c). His Iranian passport will not expire until \n2011 (Item 4). He would not have renewed his Iranian passport if he had known it would \njeopardize his security clearance (Item 4). He offered to relinquish his Iranian passport \nand take action to establish that his Iranian passport could not be renewed or re-\n \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

Items 4 (response to SOR) and 5 (responses to \nInterrogatories) are the sources for the facts in this section unless stated otherwise.  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nacquired (Item 4).  Retention of his security clearance \u201cis far more important to \n[Applicant] than visiting his aunt\u201d (Item 4 at 2).  \n \nOn August 1, 2008, Department Counsel suggested to Applicant how he could \nmitigate security concerns about Guideline C, Foreign Preference, stating: \n \nAs of June 2, 2008, the date of his SOR Answer, he still possessed a valid \nIranian passport.  According to the Directive, subparagraph 11(d) and (e), \nthe only mitigating conditions which related to the instant facts, the \ngovernment may consider applicant\u2019s behavior mitigated and an unlikely \nsecurity threat, if he can show that the passport use has been officially \napproved by the cognizant security authority or that the passport has \nbeen surrendered to the cognizant security authority or otherwise \ninvalidated. In the present case, there is no good-faith reason to apply \nany of the two mitigating conditions. \n \nFORM at 9 (emphasis added). Applicant did not turn-in his Iranian passport to his \nsecurity officer or destroy it in the presence of his security officer.   \n  \nIran4 \n \nIran is a \u201c\u2018constitutional, theocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy \ndominate the key power structures\u2019 and \u2018ultimate political authority is vested in a learned \nreligious scholar.\u2019\u201d (Item 7 at 1-2) (internal citations omitted). Iran engages in \nclandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction \n(WMD), sponsors international terrorism, intervenes in the internal affairs of Iraq, \nundermines the Middle East peace process, and violates the human rights of the Iranian \npeople. The United States and its allies are attempting to block Iran\u2019s goals of obtaining \nnuclear weapons and other WMD and to counter Iran\u2019s efforts to destabilize Iraq and \nother Middle East countries.   \n \nIran is one of the most active state sponsors of terrorism. The United States is \nconcerned about the possibility that terrorists could eventually obtain WMD from Iran. \nIran supports terrorists who attack Israel and Shiite militias who have encouraged, \nfacilitated and engaged in sectarian violence in Iraq. \n \nIranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, should carefully consider the risks of \ntravel in Iran because they are still considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities. \nIran does not recognize dual citizenship. The Iranian government has harassed and \ndetained dual citizens of the United States and Iran.       \n \n                                            \n4 Item 7 and its attachments are the sources for the facts in this section.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n \n5See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n6\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guidelines B (Foreign \nInfluence) and C (Foreign Preference).  \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \nApplicant\u2019s aunt is a citizen and resident of Iran. He visited her in Iran in 1996, \n2003 and 2005. He has monthly contact with her. He has provided medicine and a \nhearing aid to her. She is receiving a pension from her employment as a nurse. She is \nsick and vulnerable to Iranian pressure. He continues to possess a valid Iranian \npassport.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The complicated, \nsometimes hostile relationship of Iran with the United States places a heavy, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship \nwith his aunt does not pose a security risk and that he is not in a position to be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and his aunt.7 With its poor human rights \nrecord, and political and military adversarial relationship with the United States, it is \nconceivable that Iran would target any Iranian citizen or former citizen living in the \nUnited States in an attempt to gather valuable information from the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to his aunt create a potential conflict of interest because \nthis relationship is sufficiently close to raise a possible security concern about his desire \nto help his aunt living in Iran and Iranian authorities\u2019 potential attempt to pressure or \ncoerce him through his aunt to provide classified information.    \n \n \n7An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a heavier burden to overcome than an \napplicant with relatives living in other countries. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, \n2005) (stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d \nwhen parents and siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) \n(articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran); ISCR \nCase No. 07-12471 at 9 (A.J. May 30, 2008) (stating \u201cBetween January 9, 2007 and January 18, 2008, \nthe Appeal Board decided 36 appeals involving Iran under the old guidelines, and it reversed 20 decisions \ngranting clearances and affirmed 15 decisions denying clearances.\u201d And listing at 9 n.1 the pertinent \ncases). The Appeal Board\u2019s trend of denying clearances for Applicants with Iranian connections has \ncontinued into October 2008. See ISCR Case No. 07-13209 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) cannot be applied with respect to Applicant\u2019s relationship \nwith his aunt. Applicant has an emotional bond with his aunt. He communicates with her \nregularly and frequently. His relationship with her requires a closer examination \nbecause of those contacts and his admission of care and concern for her welfare and \nwell being. Although Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his aunt and his support for her \nis an important positive reflection on his character, the same close relationship raises \nsecurity concerns for possible foreign influence.     \n \nThere is no evidence that his aunt has been a political activist, challenging the \npolicies of the Iranian Government. There is no evidence she currently works for or has \never worked for the Iranian Government or military or any news media. There is no \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nevidence that terrorists or the Iranian Government have approached or threatened \nApplicant or his aunt for any reason. There is no evidence that these his aunt living in \nIran currently engages in activities which would bring attention to her or that they or \nother Iranian elements are even aware that Applicant works for a government contractor \nor might have access to classified information. As such, there is a reduced possibility \nthat these relatives would be targets for coercion or exploitation. But see n. 8, infra \n(discussing limited weight that can be given to the absence of such information). \n \nApplicant deserves some credit because of the reduced possibility that Iran will \nexploit his aunt because of the low profile she has in Iranian society. Applicant\u2019s close \nrelationship with his aunt, his frequent contacts with her, and the nature of the Iranian \nGovernment and its complicated, and contentious relationship to the United States, all \nweigh against mitigating security concerns. See ADP Case No. 05-17812 at 2, 3 n.2 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2007) (finding contacts with siblings in PRC \u201conce every two or three  \nmonths\u201d not to be casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s parents and sisters a total of about 20 \ntimes per year not casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months \nnot casual and infrequent).8     \n \nApplicant\u2019s deep relationship with his wife and son and his strong connections to \nthe United States tends to mitigate foreign interest security concerns.

Jan. 28, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed the \nprecedential value of the decisions predating the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines indicated in n. 1, \nsupra, and determined where the language of the Directive is unchanged or not substantively altered, the \nprecedent remains valid. AG \u00b6 8(c) apparently adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation of Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Condition 1 (FIMC 1) under the previous guidelines. The Appeal Board had \ndetermined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent to \napply FIMC 1. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Moreover, contacts with such \nfamily members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id.

May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a \nforeign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian \ngovernment has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd.

Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd.

He \ncontinues to possess an Iranian passport that will continue to be valid until 2011, \nestablishing AG \u00b6 10(a). \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority. \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Although he offered to invalidate or \nrelinquish his Iranian passport in his SOR response, he did not actually do so. \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nDepartment Counsel reminded him in the FORM that he could mitigate Foreign \nPreference concerns through AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(d) and 11(e), however, he did not take action to \neffectuate these provisions.9    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant promised to report any Iranian contact seeking information to law \nenforcement authorities. I found this promise to be sincere and credible. However, in \nISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an \nadministrative judge\u2019s decision to grant a PRC Applicant\u2019s clearance because he gave \ntoo much weight to the Applicant\u2019s \u201cstrong ties to the U.S.\u201d and determined there was \ninsufficient evidentiary support for the conclusion that he \u201ccan be trusted to resolve any \nconflict of interest . . . in favor of the U.S.\u201d The Applicant in ISCR Case No. 06-24575 \nsaid he would not act against the U.S. if faced with the choice. However, the Appeal \nBoard gives such promises little weight in their de novo review of the evidence,10 \nstating: \n                                            \n9 In the decretal paragraph, I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a because the Iranian \npassport he renewed in 1996 is no longer valid. The foreign preference allegations concerning his Iranian \npassport are adequately addressed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c.     \n \n10 The Supreme Court in United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined \nthe phrase \"de novo determination\": \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nAn Applicant\u2019s stated intention as to what he would do in the future is of \nrelatively little weight, given the record in this case. See ISCR Case No. \n03-09053 at (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s stated intention \nabout what he or she might do in the future under some hypothetical set of \ncircumstances is merely a statement of intention that is not entitled to \nmuch weight, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted \nin a similar manner in the past under similar circumstances.\u201d) \n \nId. at 4. See also ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007) (criticizing the \nadministrative judge\u2019s reliance on PRC-Applicant\u2019s promise to choose the U.S. over \nPRC should a conflict arise, and reversing the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant a \nclearance). I respect the Appeal Board\u2019s position and give little weight to Applicant\u2019s \npromise to report any such contacts that might occur. \n    \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iran must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Iran, as well as the dangers existing in Iran.11 Iran\u2019s relationship \nwith the United States has significantly changed over the decades and is likely to \nchange again in the future. Iran was an important U.S. ally after World War II until \nremoval of the Shah, but is not in an adversarial relationship with the United States. Iran \nhas a poor human rights record. Iran seeks weapons of mass destruction, and supports \nterrorism.  \n \nThere are significant factors supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Applicant has lived in the United States for 32 years. He became \na U.S. citizen in 1991. His wife and son are U.S. citizens and residents of the United \n \n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent \ndetermination of a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the \nsame controversy. Thus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, \n23 [(1974)], the Court had occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \n\"unfettered by any prejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim \nthat the [agency's] determination is supported by substantial evidence.\" And, in United \nStates v. First City National Bank, 386 U.S. 361, 368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \n\"review de novo\" means \"that the court should make an independent determination of the \nissues\" and should \"not . . .  give any special weight to the [prior] determination of\" the \nadministrative agency.  \n \n(internal footnotes omitted). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2007), the Appeal Board \ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, \nand then decided the case itself. Judge White\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility \ndeterminations and ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the \njudge who makes witness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-\n11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2006) (Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to \nreverse hearing-level judicial decisions and recommends remanding cases to resolve material, prejudicial \nerror). \n \n11 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion).  \n \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nStates. His property and assets are in the United States and he has no assets in Iran. \nApplicant is a law-abiding U.S. citizen, and there is no evidence of any performance or \nwork-related problems. He compellingly described his loyalty to the United States, \nrather than to the Iran. I found his statements to be honest, candid and credible.    \n \nOne element increasing the foreign influence security concern is Applicant\u2019s \nfrequent contacts with his aunt, and his visits to Iran to see her. He communicates with \nher on a monthly basis. Applicant clearly has a close relationship with his elderly aunt \nliving in Iran.  She is vulnerable to Iranian coercion and non-coercive measures \nbecause of her Iranian citizenship and where she lives. She also receives a pension for \nher work as a nurse, and the Iranian government could exert pressure on her and \nApplicant by threatening to stop or stopping her pension. Because Iranian government \nand intelligence personnel may violate Iranian or international law, they are more likely \nto use improper and/or illegal means to obtain classified information through his aunt.   \n \n \nAfter carefully weighing the evidence of his connections to Iran and to the United \nStates, I conclude Applicant has failed carry his burden of mitigating the foreign \ninfluence and foreign preference security concerns.  \n \n           I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d12 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b and 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n12See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 17,\n2005. On October 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 19, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 8, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on November 21, 2007. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 18, 2008, and the case was assigned to\nme on January 25, 2008. \nMarch 24, 2008\n\n2\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 4, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on February 20, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand submitted exhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. I\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 5, 2008, to submit\nadditional matters. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 29,\n2008. On February 29 and March 5, 2008, Applicant submitted AE D and AE E, without\nobjection, and the record was closed. Based upon thorough review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 8, 2007, (hereinafter \u201cAnswer\u201d)\nApplicant admitted the truth of all the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j, with\nexplanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions and explanations are incorporated in the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old Chief Technology Officer, and one of three founders, of\na defense contractor that provides sophisticated surveillance equipment. Both of his\npartners hold Top Secret clearances. Applicant has never previously applied for a\nclearance, but now needs one to support military requirements for their product in\nvarious theaters of active operations.  He worked as a chief technologist for a major\nhigh-technology company from January 1993 until May 2002, when he was laid off as\npart of the major contraction in the technology markets (tech crash). For the remainder\nof that year, he worked for a small technology company that failed. In 2003, he founded\nhis present company with a retired civilian DoD employee and his son. Applicant and\nthe son had worked together from 1995 or 1996 until the lay offs. Their new company\nwas formally incorporated in June 2006. (GE 4 at 7-11.) The company has been\nsuccessful, with revenue roughly doubling each year. (Tr. at 53.)\nApplicant and his wife were divorced in 1998, after 16 years of marriage. He\nacquired all of their debts, and was awarded custody of their then 11-year-old son. In\n1999, he purchased his present home for $323,000. He had a perfect credit rating and\nsubstantial income. He entered into some highly leveraged technology investments, and\nlost all his money when the market crashed. When he lost his job in 2002, he stopped\npaying his unsecured debts, and did all he could to remain current on his secured debts\nso he could retain his home and car. The credit bureau reports (CBR) in the record\nshow that each of the nine delinquent debts, listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.j, became\ndelinquent between October 2002 and June 2003. The April 2000 judgment debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a arose from a legal dispute over his purchase of a mobile home for his mother\nin another state. (Tr. at 70.) \nApplicant\u2019s present salary is over $200,000 per year. His home is now worth\naround $600,000, with about $310,000 in remaining mortgage loans. He also owns his\nmother\u2019s residence, valued at over $270,000. During their company\u2019s start-up period,\n\n3\neach of the partners agreed to deposit one-third of his post-tax salary back into a\ncompany-held account to provide sufficient liquidity to meet the cash-flow requirements\nof producing and selling their equipment-intensive products. The combination of these\nfunds and undistributed company profits grew Applicant\u2019s share of this company-held\naccount to approximately $200,000. (Tr. at 52-55, 62-63.)\nApplicant admitted owing each of the delinquent unsecured debts listed in the\nSOR, totaling just over $232,000, at the time. (Answer.) As his income recovered with\ncompany growth, he brought each of his secured debts current and began retiring his\nunsecured debts. He never intended to shirk them or avoid them through bankruptcy,\nwhich he considers a dishonorable way to deal with legitimate debts. (Tr. at 91-93.)\nWhen he realized that the presence of these debts could raise concerns about his\neligibility for a security clearance he took several steps to begin resolving them more\nquickly. He paid the $32,596 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g from his personal savings. (GE 5\nat 3; Tr. at 19, 35, 83.) He also arranged with his partners to withdraw $75,000 of his\nfunds from the company-held cash-flow account to further pay down the debts. (Tr. at\n35, 54, 62-63.)\nBecause he had to spend extended periods overseas in support of military\noperations using his company\u2019s equipment, he retained an attorney to investigate and\nnegotiate resolution of his remaining debts in November 2007. He set aside the $75,000\nfrom the company fund and $25,000 from his savings for paying the attorney\u2019s\nnegotiated pay offs. (AE B; Tr. at 35, 67-69.) After investigating the circumstances, the\nattorney advised Applicant that, due to the age of the debts, he should wait for the\nStatute of Limitations to expire rather than repay them. (AE D at 4.) His state\u2019s Statute\nof Limitations is six years on contract debts and liabilities, including revolving accounts,\nand ten years on judgments. Applicant was not satisfied with this approach, and\npromptly paid off the two debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i. (AE D at 2; AE E.)\nAccordingly, only $93,347 of the originally alleged $232,000 remains unresolved.\nApplicant intends to resolve those debts as funds become available. His current monthly\nsurplus of income over expenses is over $4,500, so he has the means to do so\ncomfortably in less than two years. He does not consider risking his company\u2019s short-\nterm cash flow solvency by further withdrawing his invested funds to be a wise option.\nNor does he want to incur further mortgage debt by withdrawing his substantial equity in\nhis or his mother\u2019s home for this purpose. Nevertheless, the presence of these assets\nmakes his total net worth about $600,000. (AE D.)\nBoth of Applicant\u2019s partners testified to their complete confidence in his integrity,\nresponsibility and dedication to serving the national defense efforts through his\nsubstantial and unique technical ability. The senior of the two spent his entire first\ncareer developing defense systems and has held a clearance for many years.\nApplicant\u2019s dedication is further evidenced by his frequent deployments into areas of\nactive military operations to support and improve the enhanced tactical capabilities his\nequipment provides to military forces. Applicant\u2019s demeanor was serious, credible, and\nhe demonstrated both understanding of, and intent to honorably resolve, his finances.\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat two were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances (Tr. at 123.): \u201c(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe evidence shows that Applicant is quite willing to satisfy his remaining debts,\nand is approaching their resolution in a reasonable manner that minimizes risk to his\nongoing successful business. He could use present assets to repay those debts if he\nhad to, but it would be financially less wise than paying them off over the next year or\ntwo. Although, he was unable to meet his debts during the period from October 2002 to\nJune 2003, he has not incurred further delinquent debt since then and has resolved\n60% of the debt he incurred. Security concerns are raised under both AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and\n19(c), but concerns under the former are much less significant than they were several\nyears ago. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Four pertinent\nconditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n6\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts all arose during a nine-month period of financial\nsetbacks created by adverse investments and job losses during the tech crash. This\noccurred shortly after his 16-year marriage ended in divorce and he assumed all the\nfamily debt. His company is now in very good financial condition and he earns a salary\nin excess of $200,000 in addition to earning a share of profits. He has brought all his\nsecured debt current and resolved the majority of his unsecured debt. While around\n$90,000 remains to be repaid, he has the means and intention to do so, contrary to the\nadvice of his attorney to wait a year for them to become uncollectible. He refused to\nseek bankruptcy protection, intending to honorably fulfill his obligations as he became\nable to do so. This established substantial mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (c) and (d).\nApplicant\u2019s debts did not arise from any lack of judgment, poor self-control, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. With a salary over $200,000 and net\nworth over $600,000, he is not financially overextended. Combined with his\ndemonstrated integrity and good character, his finances create extremely small, if any,\nrisk of illegal activity to generate funds.\n Whole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves delinquent debts that were incurred due to circumstances beyond his\ncontrol. He invested significant skill, resources and hard work to start a company that\npermitted him to resume lucrative employment, and has regained the means to resolve\nthese issues. He is a mature and established individual who is responsible and making\n\n7\nwise recent financial choices. There is no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation\nor duress since his financial situation is fully known to his business partners. The\nfinancial and technical success of his company and their products, and the absence of\nnew delinquent debt for five years, make continuation or recurrence quite unlikely.  \nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability\nand trustworthiness security concerns arising from his former inability to satisfy debts\nand history of not meeting financial obligations. He established his integrity, good\ncharacter, and ability to protect classified information. \u201cAn applicant is not required to\nshow that [he] has completely paid off [his] indebtedness, only that [he] has established\na reasonable plan to resolve [his] debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to implement\nthat plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case\nNo. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006)). Overall, the record evidence leaves\nneither questions nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has fully mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant is a 37-year-old senior acquisitions analyst employed by a Government contractor. While in high school, Applicant worked as a summer intern for a Government agency and received access to classified information at the top secret level (Tr. 41). He attended college from 1991 to 1996, and received two Bachelor\u2019s degrees with concentrations in finance and international business (Tr. 5). He married his wife in 1996 and divorced her in 2002. He has a 12-year-old-daughter from this marriage. He shares legal custody of his daughter with his ex-wife (Tr. 82).

He failed to mitigate personal conduct concerns arising from his \nfalsification of his public trust position application. Eligibility for a public trust position \nand access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Public Trust Position Application (SF85P) (GE 4) on \nOctober 10, 2006.1 On March 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct).2  \n \n1  Applicant submitted an Application for Federal Employment (SF 171) on Jan. 2, 1990 (GE 1); a \nQuestionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) on May 15, 1990 (GE 2), a Security Clearance Application \nin June 2004 (AE 7), and an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on Jun. 23, \n2008 (GE 5). The falsification allegation concerns only Applicant\u2019s October 2006 SF85P. \n \nSeptember 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 8, 2008, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on June 10, 2008. DOHA issued a \nNotice of Hearing on June 16, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 9, \n2008. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were received without \nobjection (Tr. 32). Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented one witness, and \nsubmitted exhibits (AE) 1 through 7, which were received without objection (Tr. 23, 35). \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 18, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nThe Government withdrew the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.f; \u00b6 2; and \u00b6\u00b6 3.b \nand 3.c (Tr. 17-19).3 I did not address these allegations. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b with \nexplanations. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, including \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old senior acquisitions analyst employed by a Government \ncontractor. While in high school, Applicant worked as a summer intern for a Government \nagency and received access to classified information at the top secret level (Tr. 41). He \nattended college from 1991 to 1996, and received two Bachelor\u2019s degrees with \nconcentrations in finance and international business (Tr. 5). He married his wife in 1996 \nand divorced her in 2002. He has a 12-year-old-daughter from this marriage. He shares \nlegal custody of his daughter with his ex-wife (Tr. 82). \n \nAfter college, he worked from 1996 to 2000 as a financial analyst for a U.S. \nGovernment agency in a position of trust (Tr. 78). Thereafter, he worked as pricing \nanalyst for one year, and then worked numerous jobs as bartender, server, and in the \nInformation Technology field (GE 5). In 2005, he started working as a contract specialist \nfor a Government contractor. Since June 2006, he has been working for his current \nemployer, another Government contractor, in a position of trust. Applicant has been \nworking in a position of trust for the last four years (Tr. 7). \n \nApplicant\u2019s references included two directors and four senior military officers (AE \n1-6). Five of them have known him and observed his performance and character for at \n \n2  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended \n(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December \n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n3  See Appellate Exhibit 2, Government\u2019s Notice, dated June 3, 2008. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nleast two years. One colonel has known Applicant since 1996, and supervised him for \napproximately seven years. Applicant is considered a hard-working and intelligent \nemployee, and an honest man who takes his job seriously. All of his references lauded \nhis organization skills, efficiency, competence, and communication skills. In their \nopinion, Applicant always displays the highest degree of integrity and impeccable work \nethic. In their opinion, he is trustworthy and displays sound judgment. All of his \nreferences recommended him for a position of trust. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his April 2007 response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 9), two \ncredit bureau reports (CBRs) from 2006 (GE 7), and 2007 (GE 8), a 1999 Federal tax \nlien, and his 2006 public trust application. The SOR alleges that Applicant filed for \nbankruptcy protection in 2000, and that he had a Federal tax lien imposed as a result of \na money judgment granted against him in a civil law suit brought by the U.S. \nGovernment. The SOR also alleges Applicant falsified his public trust application by \ndeliberately failing to disclose his bankruptcy and tax lien. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father worked over 20 years for a Government agency as a budget \nanalyst in charge of a large budget program.4 Around 1989-1990, while Applicant was in \nhigh school, his father set up a ghost company and named Applicant\u2019s mother, \nApplicant, and his siblings as officers of the corporation. From 1991 to 1996, Applicant\u2019s \nfather made false claims and statements to his agency and his ghost company received \nover 6 million dollars in illegal/unauthorized payments.5 \n \nThe U.S. Government brought a civil law suit against Applicant\u2019s father, the ghost \ncompany and all family members involved with the ghost company. The United States \nalleged Applicant\u2019s family spent and dissipated the monies falsely obtained and, when \nthey learned their misappropriation had been discovered, they destroyed evidence and \nsecreted assets to impede the Government\u2019s recovery and prosecution efforts. \nApplicant and his family denied the allegations. When questioned about the ghost \ncompany activities and the sources of their income, they asserted their right against \nself-incrimination.  \n \nIn May 1999, a Court granted summary judgment against Applicant for \n$5,530,805. In October 1999, the U.S. Government filed a tax lien against Applicant \nbased on the judgment and started garnishing his wages. Applicant filed for bankruptcy \nprotection in August 2000 and was discharged of his debts in December 2000. In April \n2001, Applicant entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Government which \nrequired Applicant to sell his home and any and all property of value to reimburse the \nGovernment (Tr. 43). After a settlement was reached, the garnishment of his wages \nstopped and the tax lien was removed. However, the settlement will not be concluded \n \n4  His father suffers from muscular dystrophy. He is bound to a wheel chair, and requires the use \nof a respirator and colostomy bag (Tr. 40). \n \n5  GE 9 is the source of the facts in the next three paragraphs, unless otherwise stated. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nuntil Applicant\u2019s father dies and his estate, insurance proceeds, and Applicant\u2019s \ngrandfather\u2019s estate trust are surrendered to the U.S. Government. \n \nApplicant explained that the civil judgment, wage garnishments, tax lien, attorney \nfees, and his wife\u2019s filing for divorce and leaving him with the household expenses \nforced him to file for bankruptcy protection (Tr. 38). \n \nIn June 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (AE 7), in \nwhich he disclosed his 2000 bankruptcy filing;6 that his wages had been garnished in \n2000 by the U.S. Depepartment of Justice; and that he had an unpaid judgment \nresulting from the civil law suit brought against him by the Government. In his answer to \nquestion 36, he denied that in the last seven years he had a lien placed against him. He \nexplained this answer as an honest mistake. \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (GE 4). \nIn response to question 19 (asking whether he, or a company over which he exercised \nsome control, filed for bankruptcy, . . . was subject to a tax lien, or had a judgment \nrendered against him for a debt), he answered \u201cNo,\u201d and deliberately failed to disclose \nthe 1999 judgment obtained by the Government, the tax lien placed against him, and his \n2000 bankruptcy filing and discharge. \n \nApplicant strongly denied he ever intended to misrepresent the facts or lie in his \npublic trust application. He claimed he disclosed all the missing information to a \nGovernment investigator during an interview conducted after he submitted his public \ntrust application (Tr. 45). He also noted he had disclosed all the missing information in \nhis 2004 Security Clearance Application (AE 7).  \n \nApplicant offered several explanations for his failure to disclose the required \ninformation, i.e., he mixed up the dates (Tr. 44, 61); he made an honest mistake and \n\u201clumped\u201d the date of the judgment (May 1999) with the bankruptcy (filed August 2000) \nand, he believed the bankruptcy and tax lien were seven years old and, as such, not \nsubject to disclosure (Tr. 65-66); he believed the garnishments and the tax lien were \n\u201cwater under the bridge\u201d and he did not have to disclose them because he had reached \na settlement agreement with the Government and the garnishment of wages was \nstopped and the tax lien was removed (Tr. 62, 67). He stated: \u201c. . . I was trying to figure \nout if I could finally put all this stuff behind me. I mean, it was such a long time ago. \nEverything was finalized. It\u2019s all, and it\u2019s all water under the bridge . . . And if I had \nwaited another nine months, this would have been seven years ago (Tr. 67-68).\u201d \n \nApplicant vehemently asserted he had no knowledge and never suspected his \nfather was defrauding the U.S. Government. Applicant benefited from the proceeds of \nhis father\u2019s fraud because his father gave him the down payment for his home, paid for \nhis college education, he used the ghost company\u2019s cars, and was paid a salary (Tr. \n58). \n \n6  At his hearing, Applicant clarified he mistakenly wrote the wrong date in his 2008 e-QIP (Tr. \n47). He filed for bankruptcy protection once in August 2000. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d7 \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d8 The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made.9  \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d10 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n \n \n7  See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.   \n \n8  See Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. \n \n9  See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.    \n \n10  See Department of the Army v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528, 531 (1988). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the trustworthiness concern is that an Applicant\u2019s  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nAG & 19 lists nine conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying:  \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the \nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling \nproblems, or other issues of security concern; \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same; \n(h) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of living, \nincrease in net worth, or money transfers that cannot be explained by \nsubject's known legal sources of income; and \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets or \nreturning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of gambling \nlosses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay gambling debts, family \nconflict or other problems caused by gambling. \n \n \nApplicant was an officer of a ghost company created by his father which \ndefrauded the Government by deceptive and illegal financial practices. He was 20 years \nold when his father started defrauding the Government in 1991, and 25 years old when \nthe fraud was discovered in 1996. Applicant, his parents, and sibling benefited from this \nfraud. He had a $5,530,805 judgment filed against him in May 1999, which is still \noutstanding. Although he entered into a settlement agreement with the Government, the \nsettlement will not be final for an unknown number of years. His bankruptcy filing \nresulted from the expenses associated with his attorney fees, his wage garnishments, \ntax lien, the surrendering of all his valuables to the Government, and the expenses \nassociated with his divorce. AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \nAG \u00b6 19(d) (deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan \nstatements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust), apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG & 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions (MC), and the record \nevidence as a whole, I conclude the following mitigating condition applies.  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father defrauded the Government from 1991 to 1996. Applicant\u2019s \nimplication in his father\u2019s illegal actions and his benefiting from them also stopped in \n1996. There is no evidence showing Applicant knowingly participated in his father \nfraudulent scheme. His financial problems and resulting bankruptcy filing were the result \nof his father\u2019s actions and not Applicant\u2019s. Under the circumstances, I find his \nquestionable behavior to be remote and unlikely to recur. His current CBRs do not show  \nquestionable financial behavior. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security \nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG & 15. \n \nThe record evidence established Applicant deliberately failed to disclose relevant \ninformation in his answers to question 19 of his public trust application. Numerous \nfactors weighed in my analysis to reach that conclusion, including: Applicant=s age, his \nlevel of education, his employment history, his familiarity working with the Government \nand the security clearance system, the magnitude and seriousness of the fraud \ncommitted by his father and the resulting legal actions Applicant faced, and his \ndemeanor and testimony.  \n \nApplicant knew or should have known the importance of accurate completion of \nhis public trust position application, and nevertheless failed to provide information that \nwas material to making an informed trustworthiness determination. Disqualifying \nConditions (DC) 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . ., and DC 16(e): personal conduct or \nconcealment of information about one=s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress . . ., apply. \n \nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions and conclude that \nnone apply. Applicant=s falsification is recent, and his favorable information is not \nsufficient to fully apply any of the mitigating conditions. I specifically considered that \nApplicant had previously disclosed the omitted information in his June 2004 Security \nClearance Application. He knew from past experience that he was required to disclose \nthe information in his public trust application. Notwithstanding, he knowingly decided to \nomit the required information because he \u201cwas trying to put all that stuff behind [him].\u201d \nConsidering the legal ordeal Applicant faced from 1996 to 2001, his education, and job \nexperience, I find it difficult to believe that he could have made an honest mistake. \nFurthermore, he failed to establish that he disclosed the omitted information to the \nGovernment investigator prior to him being confronted with the falsification. Guideline E \nis decided against Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a),  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant successfully worked in \npositions of trust for defense contractors for approximately nine years. He is a hard-\nworking and intelligent employee. He is considered a man of integrity, trustworthy, and \nof sound judgment. All of his references recommended him for a position of trust. He is \na dedicated father who takes care of his daughter.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a & 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b & 1.c:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges debts under the financial considerations guideline. Applicant admitted some debts and denied others. Almost all of her denials resulted from not recognizing the collection agency holding the debt at the time. Applicant is 49 years old, single, and has one nine-year-old daughter. She has not received child support since April 2008 (Tr. 36), but expects it to resume in the future. She works as a maintenance scheduler. She has worked for her employer (or his successor) since 1985 (Tr. 38). She does not know whether she has ever had a security clearance, but she has a security badge. She seeks a security clearance. The SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling $49,989 under the financial considerations guideline. Several of the debts are over nine years old. However, the account in 1.a. became delinquent in July 2007. In April 2006, Applicant explained in an interview (GE 3) that her financial problems were triggered in 1997 when she was laid off for about a year. At some time in early 1998, Applicant was rehired for a short time only to be laid off a second time. She was rehired in the spring of 1998. In July 1999, Applicant took pregnancy leave. Her baby was born prematurely. Applicant has been working at her job location from the spring of 1998 to the present time (GE 1).

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA) on May 9, 2008.\nOn December 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nMay 29, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant submitted her notarized answer to the SOR on January 12, 2009.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 23, 2009, and the hearing was held on April\n7, 2009. At the hearing, six exhibits (GE 1 through 6) were admitted in evidence without\nobjection to support the Government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and presented one\nexhibit (AE A) from her security manager describing the conditions under which she\nneeded a security clearance. DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.) of the\nproceedings on April 15, 2009.\nRulings on Procedure\nThe Directive (E3.1.8.) requires that an applicant shall be notified 15 days in\nadvance of a hearing near an applicant\u2019s place of employment or residence. With the\nnotice of hearing dated March 23, 2009 and the hearing dated April 7, 2009, Applicant\nwas not given 15 days notice of the hearing. However, the government notified\nApplicant by telephone on March 17, 2009 that the hearing would take place on April 7,\n2009, and Applicant recalled the telephone conversation with Department Counsel (Tr.\n7-8). Having been notified of the hearing date six days in advance of the notice of\nhearing (March 23, 2009), I am satisfied that both elements of E3.1.8. were satisfied as\nto notification and location of the hearing. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges debts under the financial considerations guideline. Applicant\nadmitted some debts and denied others. Almost all of her denials resulted from not\nrecognizing the collection agency holding the debt at the time. Applicant is 49 years old,\nsingle, and has one nine-year-old daughter. She has not received child support since\nApril 2008 (Tr. 36), but expects it to resume in the future. She works as a maintenance\nscheduler. She has worked for her employer (or his successor) since 1985 (Tr. 38). She\ndoes not know whether she has ever had a security clearance, but she has a security\nbadge. She seeks a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling $49,989 under the financial\nconsiderations guideline. Several of the debts are over nine years old. However, the\naccount in 1.a. became delinquent in July 2007. \nIn April 2006, Applicant explained in an interview (GE 3) that her financial\nproblems were triggered in 1997 when she was laid off for about a year. At some time in\nearly 1998, Applicant was rehired for a short time only to be laid off a second time. She\nwas rehired in the spring of 1998. In July 1999, Applicant took pregnancy leave. Her\nbaby was born prematurely. Applicant has been working at her job location from the\nspring of 1998 to the present time (GE 1).\nEven though Applicant was aware she had delinquent debt, she decided to help\nher brother after he lost his job in 2007. To keep him from committing suicide, she\nconvinced him to stay at her home until the summer of 2008 (Tr. 43). During the same\nperiod, Applicant helped her mother (Id.) Applicant tried several times to deal with her\n\n3\ndelinquent debts, but some emergency always arose to keep her from taking action (Tr.\n48). In July 2008 (GE 2), she learned that several of the creditors and collection\nagencies in her credit report engaged in sinister credit practices. She planned to file a\nlawsuit against the listed creditors. She never got a chance to dispute the debts (Tr. 50).\nSOR 1.a. $50, medical debt. The credit report (GE 4) shows the last activity date\non the debt is reported as July 2007. Applicant is not aware of the account. Applicant\nowes for this debt. \nSOR 1.b. $208, telephone debt. The credit report (GE 4) shows the last activity\non this debt was August 2006. Applicant owes the debt.\nSOR 1.c. $1,112, credit card. Applicant explained in GE 3 that she sold her\nhouse in 2004, and opened a credit card account. There were four hurricanes that\nprevented her from going to work. She used the credit cards to live. This debt is still\nunresolved. \nSOR 1.d. $1,853, department store credit card. GE 6 shows the last activity on\nthis card was October 2005 (Tr. 51). Applicant still owes this debt. \nSOR 1.e. $1,729, insufficient information to identify this account, and Applicant\nhas no knowledge. I find for Applicant.  \nSOR 1.f. $896, insufficient information to identify debt which is being handled by\na collection agency. Applicant included the debt in her SCA (GE 1). The debt is still\nunresolved. \nSOR 1.g. $11,570, deficiency balance after repossession of the car. The last\nactivity on this account was June 2004. Applicant had the car for about three months\n(Tr. 54), but turned the car back over to the dealer as she could not handle payments,\nand the car was continually breaking down (Tr. 54). The debt has not been paid.\nSOR 1.h. $11,238, education loan. Applicant\u2019s wages are being garnished to pay\noff loan. The last activity on this account (GE 4) was June 2004. See also, GE 2. This\ndebt is unresolved. I have taken official notice that there is no statute of limitations on\nFederal obligations such a student loans. \nSOR 1.i. $209, medical account. This account has not been paid.\nSOR 1.j. $800, medical account. According to GE 6, the last activity on the\naccount was in August 1999. \nSOR 1.k. $947, credit card. Applicant recalled having insurance to pay the\naccount. The last activity on the account (GE 6) was August 1999. The state statute of\nlimitations makes the account unenforceable, but Applicant still owes the debt. Because\n\n4\nApplicant has not acted to resolve any of the listed debts, I find the limitations statute\ninapplicable. \nSOR 1.l. $900, credit card. As with SOR 1.k., Applicant believed her insurance\nwas supposed to pay this debt. GE 6 reflects the last activity on the account was in\nAugust 1999. Even though the debt would be outside the time statute, it has not been\napplied. \nSOR 1.m. $6,724, department store credit card. Applicant admitted the debt, but\nthe account does not appear in the credit reports. She still owes the debt. \nSOR 1.n. $11,238, same educational loan appears in SOR 1.h.\nSOR 1.o. $201, medical account. The last activity on this account (GE 4, GE 6)\nwas December 1999. The state statute of limitations makes this debt unenforceable.\nHowever, Applicant still owes the debt, and, under the circumstances does not receive\nthe benefit of this statute. \nSOR 1.p. $74, medical account. The last activity on this account (GE 6) was in\nAugust 1999. Though this debt is unenforceable under the state statute of limitations\nstatute, Applicant still owes the debt. Her negligible effort in repaying any of the\ncreditors precludes her from favorable consideration under the applicable state statute\nof limitations pertaining to credit cards. \nSOR 1.q. $240, medical account. The last activity on this account is September\n1999. The delinquent debt is unenforceable under the state statute of limitations for\nbringing actions to recover a debt. However, Applicant still owes the debt. \nApplicant claimed she tried to get control over her student loan in 1997 (Tr. 69),\nbut was unsuccessful. In July 2008, Applicant tried to enroll in a debt consolidation plan\nto regain control over her debts. In GE 2, she provided documentation of enrollment\ndocuments of the plan, and also a spending plan worksheet indicating net monthly\nexpenses ($2,752) exceeded her net monthly income ($2,541) by $211 every month.\nShe did not join the plan because the plan administrators wanted $900 to begin the plan\n(Tr. 34). \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant testified that she is a reliable and trustworthy employee on the job. She\nhas a key in her pocket that gives her personal access to her employer\u2019s warehouse\nwhich contains over $200,000 in business products (Tr. 33). Applicant provided no\nindependent character evidence concerning her reputation or job performance.\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n6\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nApplicant accumulated 17 delinquent debts totaling almost $50,000. She is\nunable to repay the debt. Considering the passage of more than nine years, I find her\ninability to repay also suggests an unwillingness to repay. The fact that several of the\ndebts are almost 10 years old shows a history of not paying debts voluntarily incurred.\nBoth FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nI have examined all mitigating conditions under the FC guideline, but none are\napplicable. Those past due debts listed in 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.o, 1.p., and 1.q., became\ndelinquent in 1998 and 1999 when Applicant faced two layoffs followed by the\npremature birth of her child. SOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.f., and 1.g. became delinquent after\nthe beginning of 2004, or inside the controlling state statute of limitations period (5\nyears) applying to contracts and credit cards. Applicant has had steady employment\nsince 1999, yet she has done nothing to address the overdue accounts. Her inaction\ncontinues to impose a negative impact on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and\njudgment. \nFurthermore, to find in Applicant\u2019s favor under the state statute of limitations for\nthose listed delinquent debts outside the 5-year reach of the limitations statute ignores\nthe long standing DOHA Appeal Board precedent that limitation statutes cannot take the\nplace of good-faith efforts to repay creditors., ISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd.\n2001). FC mitigating condition (MC) 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment) does\nnot apply.\nA couple of layoffs in 1998 and 1999, and a pregnancy in 1999 were events that\nclearly affected Applicant\u2019s ability to pay her bills. Hence, FC MC 20.b. (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances) would apply to mitigate and\nextenuate Applicant\u2019s inability to pay her debts during the period, and a few years\nsubsequent to 1998 and 1999. However, the mitigator has no application more than\n\n7\nnine years later, particularly when Applicant has done nothing to act responsibly under\nthe circumstances. Applicant receives no credit under FC MC 20.b. \nFC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\napplies based on the documentation attached to GE 2 showing a financial profile and\nother material related to managing finances. However, the favorable evidence in GE 2\ndoes not have much probative value without indications that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems are being resolved or under control. Since there is no evidence Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems are under control, FC MC \u00b6 20.c. must be removed from\nconsideration. With no evidence of repayment of any of the creditors,  FC MC \u00b6 20.d.\n(the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) does not apply either. Applicant has not mitigated the FC guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s\nlife, and a careful consideration of nine variables that comprise whole person model:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation and recurrence. \u00b6 2, p.18 of\nthe Directive.\nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigating factors in light of all the facts\nand circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is currently 49 years old. She has\nworked at her current job location since 1985. Based on her possession of a key that\naccesses $200,000 of merchandise at her employer\u2019s warehouse, it is safe to conclude\nher employer finds that she is trustworthy and exercises good judgment. She has an\nobligation to show the government she utilizes the same good judgment and\ntrustworthiness in her personal life as she does with her employer. One of the\nrequirements for a security clearance is to demonstrate financial responsibility.\nApplicant\u2019s choice of helping members of her family instead of herself represents poor\njudgment that has not been mitigated under the FC guideline. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns raised by the government\u2019s information about his finances.\nAccordingly, his request for a security clearance is granted.\nOn September 18, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request renewal of a security clearance he was\nfirst granted in 1990 for his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the\nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nOn December 19, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR), which specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the\nDirective under Guideline F (financial considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative\nJune 19, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included eight documents (Items 1 - 8) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case. Items 5 and 8 are credit history reports obtained by DOHA adjudicators\nrather than by \u201can investigative agency pursuant to its responsibilities in connection with assisting the\nSecretary of Defense, or the Department or Agency head concerned, to safeguard classified information within\nindustry under E.O. 10865...\u201d (Directive, E3.1.20; emphasis added) However, absent objection by the\nApplicant, the credit histories are admitted and have been considered as part of the basis for my decision.\n2\nGuidelines (AG).  More specifically, the government alleged that Applicant owed\n2\napproximately $70,192 to five creditors for delinquent accounts that were either charged\noff as business losses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e) or placed for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and\n1.d). Another debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was allegedly cancelled, resulting in a corresponding\nbenefit taxable as income. \nOn February 14, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and admitted with\nexplanation all of the SOR allegations. He also requested a decision without a hearing.\nOn March 7, 2008, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials\n(FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant received the\n3\nFORM on March 17, 2008, and was given 30 days to file a response to the FORM. His\nMay 20, 2008, response to the FORM was included in the record without objection. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 2, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, the FORM and\nApplicant\u2019s response thereto, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 70 years old. Since September 2003, he has worked for a defense\ncontractor as a senior consulting field engineer. Between May 1989 and June 2003, he\nworked as an engineer or a designer for two marine industry engineering firms. Before\nthat, he worked for 33 years as a draftsman in the shipbuilding division of a major\nindustrial corporation, and served in the Army National Guard from 1956 until 1966. He\nacquired a secret clearance in 1990. Applicant and his wife have two adult children and\nhave been married for 50 years. They have lived in the same house for 31 years\n(FORM, Item 4), and as of March 2008, they were \u201cmortgage free.\u201d (FORM, Item 7)\nIn the early 1990s, Applicant began experiencing financial difficulties due to\n\u201cusing his credit cards liberally.\u201d (FORM, Item 7) When he submitted his most recent\napplication for a security clearance in 2006, he disclosed two delinquent credit card\naccounts totaling nearly $30,000. (FORM, Item 4) Available information (FORM, Items\n3, 5 - 8) shows that, as of August 2007, he owed the following debts:\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n3\n- $38,720 to a collection agency for a delinquent MBNA credit card account, as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.\n- $1,442 to a collection agency for a delinquent Cap 1 Bank credit card account,\nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.\n- $4,483 to a collection agency for a delinquent CCB Credit Services credit card\naccount, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d.\n- $17,652 to a collection agency for a delinquent Chase credit card account, as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e.\nApplicant also owed a $7,895 debt for another delinquent Chase credit card.\nHowever, the debt was cancelled in October 2006, resulting in a taxable benefit to\nApplicant for that tax year.\nApplicant has been working to repay or otherwise resolve his debts since early\n2007. (FORM, Items 3 and 6) After initially challenging the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant\nnegotiated a settlement whereby he would pay only the principal amount owed and the\ninterest and fees. He has since paid this debt. (Response to FORM; FORM, Item 6). He\nhas also made arrangements to repay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e.\nApplicant owns real estate worth about $320,000. He and his wife have\nretirement savings accounts worth about $280,000. Applicant also has investments\nworth about $75,000 and a company savings plan worth about $35,000. Finally, he has\na positive monthly cash flow of about $5,000 after expenses. (FOR, Item 7)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, these factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations) at AG \u00b6 18.\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nAs to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, even though the debt was cancelled, the fact\nhe had to declare as income the benefit of the cancellation supports the fact this was his\nobligation to pay one way or another. Because he still owes about 45% of the total debt\nalleged in the SOR, and because all of the alleged debts went unaddressed for several\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n5\nyears, the disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.\nThe government satisfied its burden of producing sufficient reliable evidence to\nsupport the SOR. His debts resulted from irresponsible use of his credit cards.\nHowever, the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 19(b) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or\nirresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay\nthe debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt) does not apply because he is\npaying his debts and it is realistic, given his assets and the actions he has already\ntaken, to expect he will repay the debts in the near future. Further, the information\nsubmitted by both Applicant and the government shows the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6\n20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) (emphasis\nadded) applies.\nThe presence or absence of delinquent debts does not end the inquiry into\nwhether one\u2019s financial problems present an unacceptable security risk. The issue is\nwhether Applicant\u2019s unpaid debt puts him at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate\nfunds to pay his debt, or whether his financial problems reflect adversely on his\njudgment, reliability, self-control, or willingness to follow rules and regulations. Applicant\nhas taken action to resolve his debts, is likely to continue those actions, and has a long\nhistory of steady employment and significant financial resources available to him. The\ntotality of available information about his finances leads me to conclude the security\nconcerns related thereto are mitigated.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 70 years old and\npresumed to be a mature, responsible adult. Everything about his background suggests\nstability and reliability \u2013 50 years of marriage to the same person, more than 30 years in\nthe same house, and more than 30 years in the same job. His financial problems have\narisen relatively recently, but are being addressed in a responsible manner. He has the\nassets and stream of income needed to resolve his debts, and it is unlikely that he will\nagain incur such delinquencies in the future. On balance, despite the fact he still owes a\ngood deal of the total debt alleged, these facts and circumstances do not present the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. A fair and commonsense\nassessment  of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances shows he has\n8\nsatisfied the doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\nallow Applicant access to classified information. Request for a security clearance is\ngranted.\n                             \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline,\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 22, 2008 and\nanswered it on the same day. He requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge\nthrough Counsel. I received the case assignment on April 2, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on April 15, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May\n13, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted Exhibits (AE) A\nMay 29, 2009\n\n2\nthrough C, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May\n26, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 18, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b but denied 1.c of the SOR, with explanations. He also\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He has never been married and has no children (Tr. 1).\nHe graduated from high school in 1994 and received his undergraduate degree in 2002.\nHe has never held a security clearance. He has been with his current employer for three\nyears (Tr. 17).\nIn June 2000, Applicant was charged with Trespass Voyeurism. He was walking\naround aimlessly in a neighborhood. Someone reported a suspicious person and the\npolice were called. He was arrested for looking in bedroom windows. He admits that he\nhad previously done the same thing. He acknowledged at the time that it was a \u201cstupid\nthing to do.\u201d He pled guilty to a misdemeanor for trespassing and paid a fine of $300.\nThe court ordered counseling (GE 2). \nApplicant consulted with a psychiatrist per a court order. He had been wrestling\nwith several issues and had already sought some counseling. He continued with the\nsame physician. He also sought ecclesiastical advice and counsel based on the\nincident. He attended counseling for a period of three or four months on a bi-weekly\nbasis (Tr. 32). He did not receive a diagnosis from the counselor (GE 4).\nIn 2005, Applicant again visited a counselor on his own accord. He was\nexperiencing a stressful time with relationships and his life goals (GE 4). He\nacknowledged that he was also dealing with some anger and frustration (Tr. 33). He\ndiscussed his problems with his church counselors as well as his parents. He realized\nthat he needed some guidance in his personal life (Tr. 33) and was very open to\nreceiving help. He attended sessions for approximately three months.\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in January 2006 (GE 1). His\nsupervisor sat at a computer and she read the questions to Applicant. He responded to\neach question and she entered the data (Tr. 39). When she asked about Section 23\n(concerning a police record), Applicant told her he had a trespassing conviction in 2000.\nHe elaborated that it was a Class C misdemeanor. His supervisor told Applicant that no\nderogatory information was found during his background employment investigation. She\nentered a \u201cno\u201d for that section. Applicant admitted that this made him uncomfortable. He\nwas expecting more questions concerning the facts of the incident. At the same time, he\nbelieved he gave her the criminal disposition and she chose not to enter it into the\napplication (Tr. 20). Applicant stressed that she had a strong personality and he decided\n\n3\nnot to make any more comments to her about the incident since she was the person in\ncharge of security issues. He acknowledges that he signed the application but did not\nread the entire form (Tr. 46).\nApplicant was credible in his explanation at the hearing that he was not familiar\nwith the security clearance process or the application. He relied on his supervisor\u2019s\nexpertise in the matter. He concedes that if he had completed the application himself,\nhe would have entered the 2000 trespass conviction. At the hearing, he acknowledged\nthat it was his responsibility. However, he answered to the best of his ability and trusted\nthe expertise of his supervisor (Tr. 49).\nApplicant completed his formal employment application on September 29, 2005.\nThe application asked for detailed information. He clearly answered a question\nconcerning any convictions to a felony or misdemeanor on the application with a \u201cyes\u201d\nand wrote trespassing - September 2000 (AE B).\nApplicant also completed an Application for Licensure (Unarmed Private Security\nOfficer) on December 6, 2005. He disclosed the 2000 conviction to the State for his\nlicense. He attached the printout from the case to the Application Licensure (AE C).  \nApplicant was extremely candid at the hearing. He explained that since this\nincident with the security application, he has had trust issues with his employer. He\nbelieved he had given sufficient information to his employer about the embarrassing\nincident and did mention to the background investigator that he would prefer \u201cnot to\nhave anyone at [his] place of employment know that information\u201d. However, Applicant\ndecided to provide them with the same information that he provided on his State\napplication. He presented copies of the police report and court documents to his\nOperations Manager (AE A). \nAt the hearing, Applicant was also extremely open about his one charge and\nconviction for trespass in 2000. He answered all questions and was not evasive. He\nexplained his humiliation about the episode. Applicant has not had any further incidents\nof any kind. He believes that he has learned important things about himself and has a\nstandard of integrity. He explained that he wanted the hearing to defend his honor and\ncommitment to his work.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n4\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n\n5\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicting that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information is another disqualifying\ncondition; and\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\nprofessional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 security clearance application did not contain his 2000  arrest\nand conviction for Trespass for Voyeurism. Applicant disclosed the conviction in his\nemployment application for \u201ctrespass\u201d with no details about the specifics. When his\nsupervisor asked him to respond to Section 23 on the security clearance application, he\ntold her that he had a conviction for a misdemeanor trespass. She did not enter the\ninformation. Applicant, although uncomfortable, relied on her judgment and expertise in\nthe security process and signed the application. He knew that he had disclosed the\ninformation to her verbally and on his employment application. He was not familiar with\nthe security clearance process. Thus, AG \u00b616(a) and 16(b) do not apply. \nIn this case, Applicant was found guilty of Trespass Voyeurism in June 2000.  He\nadmits that he walked around a neighborhood on several occasions before this incident\nand looked in bedroom windows. He was embarrassed about the incident and knows it\nwas a stupid thing to do. Thus, AG \u00b616(c) (d), and(e) apply.\n\n6\nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following conditions could mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nI find that Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct concern in this case. He\ncompleted court ordered counseling for the 2000 incident. This is the only conviction\nApplicant on his record. He continued counseling in 2005 and has discussed the\nincident with his parents and church advisors as well as his counselors. He has\ndisclosed the specific facts of the arrest and conviction with his employer. Applicant was\ncompletely candid at his hearing. He accepted responsibility for his actions. In this case,\nAG \u00b6 17(c), (d), and (e) are applicable.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a hard-working, earnest\nyoung man. He was very candid and open at the hearing. He acknowledged that he did\na very stupid thing and that he cannot change the past. He wants to move on. He likes\nhis position and wants to maintain his position.\n\n7\nApplicant relied on his supervisor\u2019s expertise when completing the security\nclearance application. He told her about a trespass conviction and also disclosed it on\nan employment application and an application for a state license for a security guard\nposition. His license was granted and he has been working for the company for three\nyears. He had no intention to deliberately deceive the Government.\nApplicant obtained counseling and has addressed personal issues. He advised\nhis church elders and his parents about the 2000 incident. He has given the complete\ncourt document to his Operations Manager. He was credible at the hearing and also\nvery sincere in acknowledging his mistakes and accepting responsibility for his actions. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from personal\nconduct.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted .\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.g.,1.j., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.p. He is a 42-year-old air traffic assistant employed by a defense contractor since April 2003. He seeks to retain the security clearance he appears to have held since May 1989. Applicant has a history of financial difficulties as far back as 1997, when he and his wife separated, and ultimately divorced. However, he has been continuously employed since at least December 1991, including more than 11 years as a federal employee. In June 2003, several years after his divorce was final, Applicant was discharged of over $132,000 in debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. Nevertheless, his financial 2 problems continued and became exacerbated over the subsequent years. In February 2002, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a $5,595 tax lien against Applicant for tax years, 1998, 1999, and 2000. This lien could not be discharged in bankruptcy. The record does not indicate whether this tax debt was due to Applicant\u2019s failure to file those tax returns in a timely fashion, his failure to withhold sufficient income tax to cover his liability, or a combination of both. However, this tax lien was released in April 2008, largely because the IRS seized his income tax refunds for tax years 2004 and 2005.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 6 March 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nF, E, and J.  Applicant answered the SOR 5 June 2008, and requested a decision\n1\nwithout hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 15 September 2008. The record in this\ncase closed 4 September 2008, the day Department Counsel indicated no objection to\nApplicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM).\nSeptember 25, 2008\n\nApplicant first filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in November 1997. However, that petition was\n2\ndismissed in June 1998, without plan confirmation, because Applicant failed to make any of the first three\nrequired payments. He re-filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy protection again in October 1999, but the petition\nwas voluntarily dismissed in August 2000. The chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge began as a third chapter 13\nbankruptcy in August 2000, but was converted to a chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2003.\nAlthough Applicant claimed to be paying on his delinquent taxes through wage garnishment in August and\n3\nSeptember 2006, I find his documentation less than persuasive, both because he only produced two pay stubs\nshowing the garnishment and because the pay stubs do not indicate what the garnishment was for, and\nApplicant produced no evidence linking the garnishments to his tax account.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.g.,1.j., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o.,\nand 1.p. He is a 42-year-old air traffic assistant employed by a defense contractor since\nApril 2003. He seeks to retain the security clearance he appears to have held since May\n1989.\nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties as far back as 1997, when he and\nhis wife separated, and ultimately divorced. However, he has been continuously\nemployed since at least December 1991, including more than 11 years as a federal\nemployee.\nIn June 2003, several years after his divorce was final, Applicant was discharged\nof over $132,000 in debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy filing.  Nevertheless, his financial\n2\nproblems continued and became exacerbated over the subsequent years.\nIn February 2002, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a $5,595 tax lien\nagainst Applicant for tax years, 1998, 1999, and 2000. This lien could not be discharged\nin bankruptcy. The record does not indicate whether this tax debt was due to Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to file those tax returns in a timely fashion, his failure to withhold sufficient\nincome tax to cover his liability, or a combination of both. However, this tax lien was\nreleased in April 2008, largely because the IRS seized his income tax refunds for tax\nyears 2004 and 2005.   In March 2005, the IRS filed a second tax lien against Applicant\n3\nfor $7,560 for tax year 2001. Again, the record does not indicate whether this tax debt\nwas due to Applicant\u2019s failure to file that tax return in a timely fashion, his failure to\nwithhold sufficient tax to cover his liability, or a combination of both. Nevertheless, the\n$7,560 figure represents penalties and interest from an original tax liability of $7,087. In\naddition to the tax lien for 2001, record evidence shows that Applicant owes $1,787 in\ndelinquent taxes for 2002, $499 for 2003, and at the time of his answer to\ninterrogatories in December 2007, had not filed either his state or federal income tax\nreturns for 2005 and 2006. The federal tax returns for 2005 and 2006 were apparently\nfiled in 2008, because IRS records from April 2008 show that IRS seized Applicant\u2019s tax\nrefund for 2005 and applied it to his 1999 tax bill. IRS records also show he owes\n$5,227 for delinquent taxes in 2006, bringing his total indebtedness to the IRS to nearly\n$15,000. He has documented no repayment plan with the IRS.\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM includes copies of child support payments made from 2004-2007.\n4\nUnfortunately for Applicant, he is able to produce confirmation of most, but not all the payments he made in\n2004, with progressively fewer document payment in the subsequent years. He provided confirmation of only\ntwo payments each in 2006 and 2007, and none for 2008.\n3\nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s indebtedness to the IRS, the SOR alleges, and\ngovernment exhibits confirm, delinquent child support of nearly $21,000 , $9,000 in\n4\ndelinquent state taxes for 2004, a $1,600 deficiency balance on an automobile\nrepossession in April 2003, and seven delinquent debts totaling just over $1,100. In his\nDecember 2007 interrogatory response, Applicant stated his intent to pay these seven\nsmall debts\u2014none of which is larger than $350.00\u2014while on his upcoming vacation.\nYet, none of these debts has been paid. \nWhen Applicant applied for a security clearance in December 2003 (Item 4),  he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to a series of questions [36\u201339 (tax liens) (unpaid judgments) (financial\ndelinquencies)]. He disclosed a February 2003 chapter 7 bankruptcy for $35,000, a\nSeptember 2000 wage garnishment, and an April 2003 mortgage foreclosure. The\ncomplete truth was somewhat more complex. He did not disclose the full history of his\nbankruptcy filings, and his explanation that he considered them all one piece is\nunreasonable given the timing of filings and dismissals, and the fact that his last chapter\n13 bankruptcy petition was not converted to a chapter 7 petition until nearly three years\nafter the original filing.\nApplicant provided several work references that indicate the quality of his\nperformance over the years. However, none of these references reveal any knowledge\nof his financial difficulties.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guidelines\nF (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n6\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan\nto pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . . (e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis; (f) financial problems that are linked to . . . gambling problems.\n. .;\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n7\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n8\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n4\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.5\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although Applicant was discharged of\nover $132,000 in delinquent debt in June 2003, he has been unable to avoid further\nfinancial difficulties.  The IRS tax lien that survived the bankruptcy discharge, was only\n6\nsatisfied in April 2008, and only then because the IRS seized tax refunds for 2004 and\n2005. The IRS could not have seized tax refunds for earlier years, because there were\nnone. Applicant owes taxes for 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2006, and has a second lien for\nthe 2001 debt. Applicant appears to have made substantial payments on his child\nsupport arrearages, but the inadequacy of his records makes it impossible to conclude\nthat he is current and can remain current on his required payments. Finally, Applicant\nhas documented no steps to address the seven small debts alleged in the SOR, or the\nrepossession deficiency.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  While his separation and divorce are a\n7\nclear circumstance beyond his control, that process ended eight years ago, and he has\nnot acted responsibly in addressing his debts since then.  There is no evidence that he\n8\n\n\u00b6 20.(c)the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n9\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b6 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n10\n\u00b6 16.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n11\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\n12\nbefore being confronted with the facts;\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n13\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or conviced;\n5\nhas sought credit counseling or otherwise brought the problem under control.  Aside\n9\nfrom his child support payments, there is very little evidence of a good-faith effort to\nsatisfy his debts.  Further, given his unwillingness to seek or use financial counseling,\n10\nthere is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will put his financial problems\nbehind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nThe government also established a case for disqualification under Guidelines E\nand J., and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although the evidence is\nmixed, and Applicant disclosed some adverse financial information, I conclude, on\nbalance, that the minimal information disclosed, coupled with the information withheld,\ndemonstrates his efforts to minimize his financial delinquencies to the government.  He\n11\ndid so knowing that these issues were of security concern to the government.\nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information\nwas relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant did not disclose his financial difficulties\nuntil his subject interview.  Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his adverse finances\n12\ndemonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an\ninterest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant\nbefore making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully\ndisclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when they perceive disclosure\nto be prudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse\ninformation about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report\ninadvertent security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the\ngovernment relies on to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of\nclassified information.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge:\nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that\nApplicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations.  Her eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on April 18,\n2006.  On October 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. DOHA\u2019s action was taken pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 5, 2007. She\nanswered the SOR in writing on November 9, 2007, and requested that her case be\nJanuary 18, 2008\n\n2\ndetermined on the record in lieu of a hearing. The government compiled its File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) on November 20, 2007.  The FORM contained documents\nidentified as Items 1 through 8.  By letter dated November 27, 2007, a copy of the\nFORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information\nand/or objections within 30 days of receipt. On December 19, 2007, Applicant timely\nfiled a response and one exhibit which I have identified as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ex.) A.\nDepartment Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s Ex. A or her response to the FORM.\nOn January 3, 2008, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains 23 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial\nConsiderations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6I 1.a. through 1.w.) (Item 1.)  In her Answer to the SOR, dated\nNovember 6, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p, and\n1.r through 1.w. of the SOR, explaining that she \u201cplan[ned] to make the necessary\npayment arrangements to satisfy [each] debt.\u201d In her Answer, Applicant did not address\n\u00b6 1.q., which alleged a $565 debt to one of her creditors. Her failure to address\nallegation 1.q. in her answer to the SOR may have been inadvertent. The debt alleged\nat \u00b6 1.q. is listed as unpaid on Applicant\u2019s credit report dated August 15, 2006.  (Item 5.)\nApplicant submitted no credible evidence to establish that the debt had been paid or\nsettled.\nAppellant is 25 years old and a high school graduate.  She is the mother of a\nseven-year-old child.  (Item 4.)  She was granted a security clearance in March 2003.\nIn August 2003, she was fired from her job because of repeated tardiness.  (Item 4.)\nApplicant admits responsibility for eight debts in collection status which were\nunpaid as of August 22, 2007.  These debts totaled approximately $7,722.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.e; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i., 1.j., and 1.k.)  She also admitted responsibility for five\ncharged-off debts totaling approximately $12,021, which were also unpaid as of August\n22, 2007.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.m., and 1.n.)\nApplicant admitted seven debts totaling approximately $1,780, which were\nunpaid as of August 15, 2006.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o., 1.p. 1.r., 1.s., 1.t., 1.u., and 1.v.)  She also\nadmitted a debt of $806, which was 60 days past due and not paid as of August 22,\n2007.  (SOR \u00b6 1.l.)  Additionally, she admitted she was responsible for a judgment for\n$838, which was not satisfied as of October 15, 2007.  (SOR \u00b6 1.w.)  Many of\nApplicant\u2019s debts were incurred between 2004 and 2006.  (Item 5.)\nIn her response to the FORM, Applicant stated she was working with a debt\nconsolidation and counseling firm \u201cto repair a few items on my credit report that would\nbe cause for concern.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Ex. A listed four debts on a form provided by a debt\nconsolidation and counseling firm, identified on the SOR at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.j., 1.k., and 1.m.\nand totaling $13,012.  Instructions on the form requested that Applicant provide missing\naccount numbers for the creditors so that the firm could contact them. The form was\n\n3\nundated.  (Ex. A.)  She failed to provide evidence she has executed a consolidation plan\nor made payments to any of the four creditors she listed on the form.\nApplicant also stated in her response to the FORM that she planned, at some\nunspecified future date, to set up payment plans with the remaining creditors.  She\nstated that her debts came about \u201cat a time of personal transition with single\nparenthood, childcare and child support concerns,\u201d events that caused her to make\nunfortunate financial decisions.  She did not specify how her parental and childcare\nresponsibilities led to her financial delinquencies. (Applicant\u2019s response to FORM at 1.)\nApplicant provided no evidence that she had received financial counseling.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines. In addition to\nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, the guidelines take\ncognizance of the complexities of human behavior and are applied in conjunction with\nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative\ngoal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. The adjudicative process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.  See A G \u00b6\n2.(c).\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. A G \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n4\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Adjudicative Guideline F, & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\n& 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated multiple debts and was unable to pay her\nfinancial obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several conditions could mitigate the security\nconcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. Unresolved financial delinquency\nmight be resolved if it happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(a))  Additionally,\nunresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, such as loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. (Guideline F,\n\u00b6 20(b))  Still other mitigating circumstances that might be applicable include evidence\nthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control (Guideline F, \u00b6\n20(c)) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\n\n5\notherwise resolve debts. (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(d).)  Applicant provided a document to show\nshe was consolidating her debts. However, she provided no evidence that the document\nhad been received by the debt consolidation company or that she had made any\npayments to the four creditors listed on the document.\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledged financial delinquencies are numerous, long-standing,\nand continue to the present day.  All of her financial delinquencies remain unresolved,\nsuggesting that the circumstances that caused these delinquencies are likely to\ncontinue in the future, thereby casting doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  Accordingly, \u00b6 20(a) does not apply as a\nmitigating condition.  Applicant attributes her financial delinquencies to assuming the\nresponsibilities of single parenthood and child care. These facts do not of themselves\nestablish that Applicant\u2019s unresolved financial delinquencies were largely beyond her\ncontrol or that she acted reasonably under the circumstances.  Nothing in the record\nsuggests that, before she received the SOR, Applicant contacted her creditors to\nnegotiate payment or settlement plans. Accordingly, I conclude \u00b6 20(b) does not apply\nto the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nNothing in the record suggests Applicant has sought or participated in financial\ncounseling and the evidence strongly shows her underlying financial problems are\nneither resolved nor under control.  Accordingly, I conclude that \u00b6 20(c) is inapplicable.  \nApplicant asserted she would pay most of her creditors at some unspecified date\nin the future.  These assertions were not persuasive. Promises to take actions in the\nfuture are not a substitute for a documented track record of remedial actions.  ISCR\nCase No. 98-0188 at 3 (App. Bd. April 29, 1999.)  In determining an individual\u2019s security\nworthiness, the government cannot rely on the possibility that an applicant might resolve\nhis or her outstanding debts at some future date.  ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 (App.\nBD. July 12, 1999).  Accordingly, I find \u00b6 20(d) does not apply in mitigation to this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nThe revised adjudicative guidelines and the Directive require that the adjudicative\nprocess in a security clearance case not only assess conduct under the adjudicative\nguidelines, but it must also reflect a careful weighing of a number of variables known as\nthe whole person concept.  The factors to be considered in a whole person analysis\ninclude the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother pertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, the likelihood for continuation or\nrecurrence.\nApplicant is a mature adult who has a history of financial over-extension. Her\nhistory of not meeting her financial obligations and her inability to pay her debts over a\n\n6\nperiod of several years raises a security concern because it suggests a lack of good\nfaith. She has promised to pay her delinquent debts in the future, but she has not\nspecified when that will be. Since she has not made any payments on her debts and\nhas not sought consumer credit counseling or assistance in learning how to manage her\nfinances, Applicant has failed to demonstrate that her delinquencies will not continue to\nbe security concerns in the future. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount\nconcern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose\nfurther punishment for past transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security\nclearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed, the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts\nand omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I\nconclude Applicant should not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my\ndecision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors\nand guidelines in Department of Defense Directive, 5220.6., as amended.  I conclude\nthat Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a  through 1.w:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________________\nJOAN CATON ANTHONY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated March 13, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, of the SOR. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 2.a-2.b of the SOR and denied any intentional falsification. Applicant denied the other allegations because the debts were disputed or he had no knowledge of them. He provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor who graduated from from high school in 1987. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy after his high school graduation and served in the Navy from 1987 to 2001, receiving an honorable discharge. He has worked for his current employer since July 2002 (GE 1). Applicant held a security clearance while in the Navy (Tr. 56). Applicant married for the first time in 1989 but divorced in 2000. He has three sons from his first marriage. He has child support directly deducted from his pay (Tr. 66). He is now remarried and has an infant daughter. His wife works from home and contributes to the family income (Tr. 68). Applicant acknowledged that he lived beyond in his means and overextended himself financially for a period of time from the mid 1990s through the early part of 2004. He did not make sound financial decisions and attributed those poor decisions to his drinking (Tr. 21). In 2004, Applicant admitted that he was in need of treatment for alcoholism.

On February 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on April 10, 2008. Applicant was not available for a hearing in April or\nMay and asked for a continuance. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 22, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 12, 2008. The Government offered\nExhibits (GE 1-7), to which the parties stipulated. Applicant testified in his own behalf,\nand submitted Exhibits (AE A-M), without objection. I kept the record open for Applicant\nJune 27, 2008\n\n2\nto submit additional information. He did submit a packet of documents consisting of 27\npages. The document was marked as AE N and entered into the record without\nobjection. The record closed on June 26, 2008. DOHA received the transcript on June\n19, 2008. Based upon a review of the record, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 13, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, of the SOR. He denied the factual allegations in\n\u00b6 2.a-2.b of the SOR and denied any intentional falsification. Applicant denied the other\nallegations because the debts were disputed or he had no knowledge of them. He\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor who graduated from\nfrom high school in 1987. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy after his high school\ngraduation and served in the Navy from 1987 to 2001, receiving an honorable\ndischarge. He has worked for his current employer since July 2002 (GE 1). Applicant\nheld a security clearance while in the Navy (Tr. 56).\nApplicant married for the first time in 1989 but divorced in 2000. He has three\nsons from his first marriage. He has child support directly deducted from his pay (Tr.\n66). He is now remarried and has an infant daughter. His wife works from home and\ncontributes to the family income (Tr. 68).\nApplicant acknowledged that he lived beyond in his means and overextended\nhimself financially for a period of time from the mid 1990s through the early part of 2004.\nHe did not make sound financial decisions and attributed those poor decisions to his\ndrinking (Tr. 21).\nIn 2004, Applicant admitted that he was in need of treatment for alcoholism. He\nentered a 12-step program and stopped drinking. He has remained sober since that\ntime (AE M). He also recognized the need to resolve his financial situation and at the\nsame time wished to exercise his legal rights concerning verification of some debts.\nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts, including medical debts. The total\namount of debt that Applicant owes is approximately $27,304 (GE 5). The debt alleged\nin allegation 1.a of the SOR stems from an automobile loan that Applicant co-signed\nwith a girlfriend in 2001. His former friend took possession of the car and moved to\nanother state. He had no further contact with her. Applicant learned in 2006 that the\nvehicle had been repossessed. The amount of the debt is $14,776 (GE 5 ).\nThe following debts alleged in the SOR relate to a hospital charge due to\nApplicant\u2019s asthma attack in 2001: allegation 1.b  from August 2005 in the amount of\n\n3\n$51; allegation 1.c $52 from August 2005; allegation 1.d for $641 from June 2005;  and\nallegation 1.e for $369. \nAllegation 1.f alleged in the SOR for approximately $7,647 is an account that\nwas charged off in 2001. \nThe debt alleged in allegation 1.g of the SOR is for $3,768 for a collection\naccount from a phone company.\nApplicant learned about the repossession of the vehicle (1.a) in the summer of\n2006. He immediately sent a certified letter to the collection agency (Cavalry) requesting\ninformation about the debt. He did not receive a response from them. As part of his\ncurrent security clearance process, he sent another certified letter asking for\ninformation. He also contacted the three credit bureau reporters and filed a formal\ndispute. Applicant did receive a response from Cavalry in October stating that Applicant\nneeded to provide proof that he had paid the account in full. Applicant still disputes the\namount and has written to them. He believed that his consumer rights were violated in\nthat he never received notification of the default and repossession of the vehicle. He will\nobtain legal assistance to dissolve or reduce the debt. \nApplicant set up a payment plan for the debts in 1.b - 1.e. He contacted the\nmedical account collection agencies in 2007. After they sent details on the medical bills,\nhe started a payment plan of $50 per month. He just made his final payment this month.\nHe submitted proof that he has no balance (AE F and AE E).\nApplicant had no knowledge of the debt alleged in 1.f until he received the SOR\nin February 2008. He does not have any information about this account. He immediately\nwrote to the collector. He has not had any response. Applicant has not yet followed up\non this account due to his wife\u2019s pregnancy and the recent birth of his daughter (Tr.49).\nHis plan of action is to follow up and speak to a supervisor with the agency. If the\ncompany does not locate the debt, he will dispute it in writing with the credit bureaus.\nApplicant disputed the phone debt (1.g) when he learned about it. He researched\nthe debt and contacted the provider. He also initiated disputes with the three credit\nbureau reporters. The phone provider had no evidence that Applicant ever did business\nwith them (Tr. 44). Applicant did receive a letter from a debt collection agency that the\naccount has been paid in full as of September 24, 2007. Applicant received information\nthat the credit bureau reporters will delete this entry from his credit reports (AE E).\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $1,400. His wife provides an additional\n$600 to $1,000 a month. After monthly expenses, he has a net remainder of $85 (AE).\nApplicant contributes to his 401(k) program. He has savings and an IRA (Tr. 75).\nApplicant recently received financial counseling from American Financial\nSolutions. He has a monthly budget and a plan of action to address the debts that\n\n4\nremain unpaid. He will seek legal assistance to have a court review of his child support\npayments and a possible reduction due to his current family situation.\nApplicant completed his August 30, 2006 security application. In that application\nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 28(a) and 28 (b) Your Financial Delinquencies (GE 2).\nApplicant explained that it was his understanding that unless there were legal\nproceedings being held concerning any delinquency, a question such as 28 regarding\nfinancial delinquencies would be answered \u201cno.\u201d He worked as a recruiter for the Navy\nfrom 1994 through December of 1997. He explained that he received training\ninstructions concerning the questions in the application for processing the recruits. He\nbased his answers to the SF 86 on this prior training (Tr. 61). He now agrees that he\nshould have answered yes to both sections of the question.\nIn 2006, Applicant was interviewed as part of the security clearance process. He\nreported to the investigator that he misunderstood the questions. The investigator\nbriefed Applicant and Applicant changed his answers to \u201cyes.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s current employer recommends Applicant for a security clearance.\nShe reports Applicant has exceptional qualities and can be trusted. Applicant is a\nconscientious worker who is very dependable and is always ready to commence\nworking (AE N). Applicant\u2019s supervisor is aware of the security concerns facing\nApplicant, and considers him a stellar employee who has consistently demonstrated a\ncommitment to a high level of professional ethics. He has recently received a promotion.\nHis previous supervisor also considers Applicant to be an exceptional professional. He\nbelieves he is resolving his financial problems. Applicant\u2019s recommendations include\none from the senior pastor of his church (AE C).\nApplicant is active in his church and his community. He leads a study group for\nthe church. He is also on the church Council and is involved in planning conferences\nand activities for the church (Tr. 25).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\n\n5\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n6\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts and\ndid not meet his financial obligations from the late 1990's until the present time. His\ncredit reports confirm that he has recent debts as well. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose in the late 1990s and continued until the present. He\naccumulated some delinquent debt and did not act responsibly while he was drinking.\nHowever, his conduct over the last six months with his creditors removes security\nconcerns or doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\nThis potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant acknowledged that he was not responsible while he was drinking and made\npoor financial choices. I find this potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant received financial counseling recently. He has a\nmonthly budget. He paid the medical accounts. He researched his debts and one has\nbeen deleted from his credit reports. He is resolving his debts. I conclude these\nmitigating conditions apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that he disputed\nthe debt in allegation 1.a and 1.f. He has formally disputed these debts and has\nprovided documentation. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\n\n7\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his 2006 security application, he did not\nlist any delinquent debts over 90 or 180 days. He answered \u201cno\u201d to question 28(a) and\n(b). He had delinquent debts at the time. Thus, he omitted relevant information.\nHowever, he was credible and forthright in his explanation that he did not believe he\nhad to list a debt for which there was no legal proceeding. Some of the debts were\nunknown to him at the time. He was open and candid at the hearing. I find he did not\nintend to provide false information. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant served his country in the military for a\nnumber of years. He is recommended highly by his employer. He has worked hard to\nsupport his family. He pays child support for his three children from his first marriage.\nHe has not had any documented problems with his employment. His current employer\npraises his hard work and professionalism.\nWhen Applicant learned about the repossession and the collection account, he\nimmediately contacted the collection agency to get information. He is now formally\n\n8\ndisputing the other debt. He has paid the medical accounts. The amount of debt is not\nsignificant to cause concern about Applicant.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on April 20, 2006. On March 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H and Guideline E that provide the bases for its\ndecision to deny Applicant access to classified information. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 17, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on March 31, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing. On\nApril 24, 2008, the government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting\nof five exhibits (Items 1-5). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and\nJune 26, 2008\n\nPresumably, the government meant hallucinogenic mushrooms or psilocybin.\n1\n2\ninstructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. On May 23, 2008, Applicant\nsubmitted his rebuttal to the FORM consisting of his statement (Ex. A), to which the\ngovernment did not object. On June 9, 2008, the case was assigned to me to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Based on a review of the government\u2019s FORM and Applicant\u2019s\nresponse, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA submits under Guideline H, drug involvement, that Applicant used LSD 50\ntimes, \u201cmushrooms,\u201d  mescaline, and cocaine three times each, and ecstasy two or\n1\nthree times from approximately 1967 to 1971 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he used marijuana from\n1967 to June 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he indicated during a January 31, 2007,\ninterview with a Department of Defense investigator that while he had no definite plans\nto use marijuana in the future, he expected to continue his current pattern of use one to\ntwo times per year (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was\nalleged to have used marijuana in June 2006 after he had submitted his security\nclearance application (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant admitted the allegations with explanation\nwhile expressing his disagreement with any suggestion of concern about his personal\ncandor. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of\nfact.\nApplicant is a 55-year-old cavity production manager, who has worked for his\ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since September 1999 (Item 4). The available\nrecord does not show that he has ever held a security clearance.\nApplicant began using marijuana on a daily basis with small groups of friends\nwhen he was 14 years of age, and he continued that abuse through high school. He\npurchased marijuana from friends at school about once a month. During that same\nperiod, from about 1967 to 1971, Applicant \u201cin the spirit of exploration or self-discovery\u201d\n(Item 2) also used other illegal drugs with small groups of friends: LSD about 50 times,\nmost of it before 1969; psilocybin mushrooms approximately three times; mescaline\nalso about three times; cocaine two to three times; and \u201ca chemical precursor\u201d to the\nsynthetic drug ecstasy once. He obtained these drugs from school acquaintances. (Item\n5).\nAfter 1971, his illicit drug involvement was limited to marijuana. He reduced the\nfrequency of his abuse of marijuana and had stopped using other drugs \u201cin the context\nof a culture in which everyone around [him] was continuing to use psychedelics and\nwere using marijuana several times a day.\u201d  Applicant used marijuana about ten times\nper year until fall 1980 when he went to college full time. For the first year or so he\ncontinued his involvement with the drug once or twice a year, and refrained from any\nuse of marijuana between 1982 and 1984. He resumed using marijuana, no more than\n\n3\nonce or twice per year and usually when on fishing trips with a certain group of friends,\nwith a latest use in June 2006 (Items 2, 5).\nIn June 1984, Applicant went to work as a cathode operations manager at his\npresent work location. In December 1987, Applicant married his spouse. From July\n1997 to September 1999, Applicant was employed as a senior process engineer for a\ncommercial company. Applicant and his employer had mutual disagreements about the\nmethodologies for solving problems or time management for hourly wage personnel,\nand Applicant left the job at the request of his direct manager. In September 1999, he\nassumed his present employment. On April 20, 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) that was entered into the e-QIP\nsystem electronically. He certified that his statements on the Questionnaire for National\nSecurity Positions (SF 86 Format) were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best of [his]\nknowledge and belief and [were] made in good faith.\u201d (Item 4). A printed form of the\ncompleted e-QIP was not included in the file for review.\nA Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) was prepared and then printed\nout on April 27, 2006, with a \u201cYES\u201d response to question 24A, \u201cLAST 7 YRS, ILLEGAL\nDRUG USE?\u201d and indicating use of marijuana seven times from April 1999 to June\n2005. Item 4 of the FORM includes the SF 86 with Applicant\u2019s signature forms from the\ne-QIP attached. There is no information of record as to how the signature forms for the\ne-QIP came to be attached to the SF 86, which does not contain a signature block.\nOn January 31, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) investigator for the Department of Defense about his drug use.\nApplicant detailed his history of illegal drug use, including his involvement with\nmarijuana once or twice per year since he was 30 (1983) to a latest use in June 2006.\nWhen asked about his future intentions, Applicant had no definite plans but expected to\ncontinue to use the drug moderately, in his current pattern. Applicant indicated that his\nspouse, mother, friends, and one coworker are aware that he had used drugs other than\nmarijuana in the past. His use of psychedelic drugs was at a time and place where they\nwere widely used, and generally more accepted than at present. The thinking at the\ntime was that psychedelic drugs in particular could expand one\u2019s consciousness, and he\nused them primarily for that purpose. He averred he was \u201clong disillusioned\u201d from that\nway of thinking and denied any intent to use any illegal drug other than marijuana in the\nfuture (Item 5). Marijuana use fostered for him \u201ca quiet introspective view of life once in\na while.\u201d He did not view it as something illegal and thought that as long as he was\ntotally honest with the Department of Defense about his intentions, it would address the\nprimary concerns of the defense community (Item 2).\nAs of March 2008, Applicant denies any intent to use any illegal drug in the\nfuture. He now realizes that any expressed intent to use marijuana in the future is \u201can\nimpediment to holding a security clearance.\u201d (Item 2). \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \u201cUse of an illegal\ndrug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises\nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d  Applicant began using illegal drugs with friends when he was only 14. He\ntried psilocybin, mescaline, and cocaine three times each, and an ecstasy equivalent\ntwo to three times. He also ingested LSD about 50 times and used marijuana daily. He\npurchased marijuana once a month. His drug abuse after 1971 was limited to\nmarijuana. Applicant used it about ten times per year until fall 1980 when he went to\ncollege full time. For the first year or so, he continued his involvement with the drug\nonce or twice a year, and refrained from any use of marijuana between 1982 and 1984.\nHe resumed using marijuana, no more than once or twice per year, until June 2006.\nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d are clearly pertinent to an\nassessment of his security suitability.\nThe government also argues persuasively for consideration of AG \u00b6 25(h),\n\u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly\ncommit to discontinue drug use.\u201d During his subject interview of January 2007,\nApplicant expressed no definite plan to use marijuana in the future, but also his\nexpectation that he would continue to use the drug in its current pattern, which was\nonce or twice a year.\nIn contrast, Applicant expressed an unequivocal denial of any intent to resume\ninvolvement with other dangerous controlled substances. While his LSD use was\nextensive even for a time and place historically given to experimentation with mind-\naltering drugs, there has been no recurrence of any drug use apart from marijuana\nsince 1971. Yet, AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot apply in\nmitigation. His abuses of LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, cocaine, and the ecstasy\nequivalent are part of his long history of illegal drug involvement and cannot be\nassessed separately from his marijuana abuse. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use continued\nuntil at least June 2006, which is considered relatively recent given that he used\nmarijuana throughout most of his adult life, albeit with limited frequency. \nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has forsworn any future marijuana\ninvolvement as well. His record of candor concerning his past drug use and future\nintentions leads me to find him credible when he states that he has no intention of using\nany illegal drug after being granted a clearance. The salient issue is whether he will be\nable to abide by this very recent resolve to abstain from a drug that for him \u201cfostered a\n\n6\nquiet introspective view of life\u201d for so many years. AG \u00b6 26(b) provides some of the\nfactors that demonstrate an intent not to abuse any drugs. In recent years, Applicant\nhas used marijuana usually on fishing trips with certain friends, including in June 2006.\nThere is no evidence of record that he has taken steps to dissociate himself from these\nfriends, so AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts\u201d\ndoes not apply. Nor is there any indication that Applicant has informed these friends that\nhe is no longer using drugs (see AG \u00b6 26(b)(2), \u201cchanging or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used\u201d), so the potential for Applicant again being around others using\nmarijuana and being offered marijuana cannot be discounted. As for \u201can appropriate\nperiod of abstinence\u201d (AG \u00b626(b)(3)), two years is not long enough to guarantee against\nrecurrence when viewed in light of marijuana use over the course of some 35 years.\nHis denial of any future intent is in writing and notarized, so it fulfills AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), \u201ca\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation,\u201d but\nis not enough to overcome the Guideline H concerns.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant exercised poor judgment raising personal conduct concerns when he\nsmoked marijuana on at least one occasion, in June 2006, after he had applied for a\nsecurity clearance. While AG \u00b6 15 is implicated, I am not persuaded by the\ngovernment\u2019s contention that AG \u00b6 16(c) and \u00b6 16(d) apply. AG \u00b6 16(c) on its face is\npertinent only when there is \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue\nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(d) is appropriately considered only when there is \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline.\u201d The use of\nmarijuana is already covered under AG \u00b6 25(a) and sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination, as discussed in Guideline H, supra. The government has not alleged or\nproven that Applicant understood fully the concerns raised by marijuana use when he\ncompleted his e-QIP and that he deliberately disregarded those concerns thereafter by\nusing marijuana. Applicant explained that he had long ceased viewing marijuana use as\nillegal, and he assumed any security concerns were assuaged by his full disclosure (\u201cIt\nhas been my guiding principle throughout this entire investigation that personal honesty\nis crucial to the DOD being able to make an accurate assessment of my eligibility for a\nclearance.\u201d Item 2).  While this is a naive view, it is consistent with his admission in\nJanuary 2007 that he expected to continue to use marijuana in the future.\n\n7\nHis failure to fully appreciate that his marijuana use was inconsistent with his\nobligation to obey the law raises in and of itself judgment concerns that cast doubt\nabout whether he can be counted on to comply with security practices and procedures.\nThose judgment concerns are not fully mitigated in the absence of credible efforts to\ndiscontinue his friendships with those involved in criminal drug use (see AG \u00b616(g),\n\u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity\u201d). None of the Guideline E\nmitigating conditions apply. His illegal drug involvement was not minor and not enough\ntime has passed to favorably consider AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that is it unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d His decision to refrain from marijuana use\nafter being granted a security clearance is a very recent development forced on him if\nhe wants to obtain the clearance and not borne predominantly of any desire to conform\nhis behavior to the law.  It falls short of the positive changes sufficient to apply AG \u00b6\n17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s drug abuse was heaviest\nduring his youth (see AG \u00b6 2(4)), but he did not leave it behind once he reached\nadulthood. He abstained for a time in college only to return to marijuana as an aid to\nintrospection and on occasion while socializing with friends. He clearly enjoyed its\neffects and had long since lost sight of its illegality by the time he applied for a security\nclearance at age 53. As of January 2007, he expected his use of marijuana to continue.\n\n8\nHis abstinence for the past two years is some proof of his ability to abstain,  but it is not\nenough to overcome the serious security concerns. Based on the record before me, I\nam unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him\naccess.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

I make the following findings: Applicant is a 58-year-old senior electrical designer employed by a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer for about 39 years, and he has held a security clearance since 1972 (Tr. 7-8; GX 14, 15, and 16). He is married and has three adult children.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on January 19, \n2007. On November 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny his application, citing security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) \nand J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR, answered it in an undated \ndocument, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.1 DOHA received \nthe request on February 1, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nFebruary 28, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on March 7, 2008. DOHA issued \n                                                          \n1 The record does not indicate whether Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was sworn.  The affidavit attached to his \nanswer in the case file pertains to Government Exhibit (GX 18), an interview of Applicant by a security investigator. \nMay 20, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \na notice of hearing on March 24, 2008, amended on March 27, 2008, scheduling the \nhearing for April 23, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 18 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, which were admitted \nwithout objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until May 7, \n2008, to enable him to submit additional matters. He telephonically requested an \nextension of time, which I granted. He timely submitted AX E, and it was admitted \nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX E is attached to the record as \nHearing Exhibit (HX) I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 1, \n2008. The record closed on May 8, 2008. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nAt the hearing, I directed Department Counsel to submit a memorandum of law \naddressing the repeal of the \u201cSmith Amendment,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 936 in the National \nDefense Authorization Act for the Fiscal Year 2008, Public Law 110-181, codified in 50 \nU.S.C. \u00a7435c.  Department Counsel submitted a memorandum of law and a motion to \namend the SOR \u00b6 1.i by replacing \u201c10 U.S.C. \u00a7 936\u201d with \u201c50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c.\u201d The \nmemorandum of law and motion to amend are attached to the record as HX II. \n \n \nAfter due consideration, I have denied the motion to amend, because to do so \nwould cause the SOR to allege a provision of the U.S. Code that had not yet been \nenacted when the SOR was issued.  The impact of the repeal of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 936 and its \nreplacement by 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c is discussed below in my analysis of Guideline H. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, \n2.g, 2.h, and 2.j. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old senior electrical designer employed by a defense \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer for about 39 years, and he has held \na security clearance since 1972 (Tr. 7-8; GX 14, 15, and 16). He is married and has \nthree adult children.  He is active in community sports activities, having coached and \nmanaged Little League teams for 11 years and Pee Wee football for three years (Tr. \n64). \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for larceny in January 1966, and paid a $15 fine (GX 9; \nAX B). He was arrested in November 1969 for breaking and entering with violence. He \npleaded guilty to breach of the peace. He was fined and placed on probation for one \nyear (GX 10; GX 13; AX B). Based on a probation officer\u2019s report and his disclosure on \na security application, the SOR alleges he was under the influence of LSD at the time of \nhis arrest in November 1969 (GX 2 at 6; GX 13 at 4). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn a sworn statement to a security investigator in May 1971, Applicant admitted \nusing marijuana \u201con numerous occasions\u201d from January 1967 to January 1971.  He also \nadmitted experimenting with LSD and taking \u201cspeed\u201d to stay awake during 1968-69 (GX \n10). A report of investigation from May 2007 reflects that Applicant admitted using \nmarijuana \u201cthroughout the 1990s\u201d (GX 18 at 3), but he denied making that statement \nwhen asked in DOHA interrogatories to review the accuracy of the report (GX 17 at 3).  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in January 1973, for breach of peace and resisting arrest. \nHe pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was fined $25 (GX 7; GX 12; AX A; AX B). \nHe was arrested in September 1975 for breach of peace and was fined $35 (GX 9; GX \n11; AX B). He was arrested in July 1976 and charged with assault in the 3rd degree, but \nthe charges were disposed of by nolle prosequi (GX 7). The reason for the decision not \nto prosecute is not reflected in the record. \n \n \nApplicant was seriously injured on the job in February 1978. He was working on \na submarine when a large light fixture fell on his head and neck, causing severe neck \ninjuries. In 1981, he was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome caused by the injury, \nand underwent a rib resection to remedy it. He still suffers from pain in his neck and \nlower back. His pain level is a 6 on a scale of 10. He has been diagnosed as having \ndegenerative disc disease, with significant loss of range of motion. He also suffers from \nnumbness and tingling in his arms. His doctor reports that he has about a 40% \nimprovement in pain relief, but it lasts only for the duration of the anesthetic (AX E).  \n \n \nApplicant crushed his right thumb in a wood splitter in 1993. About half the thumb \nwas amputated, followed by 13 surgical procedures to reconstruct it. He used marijuana \nfor about a year and a half, until some time in 1995, because his prescribed medications \ndid not control the pain (Tr. 76; AX E at 9). \n \n \nApplicant was stopped by customs officials in January 1995 and cited for having \nillegal contraband and was fined (GX 2 at 6). In response to DOHA interrogatories in \nOctober 2007, he disclosed that the contraband was a small quantity of marijuana (GX \n17 at 5), and he admitted it at the hearing (Tr. 78-80).  \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in March 2003. He \nanswered \u201cno\u201d question 23, asking whether he had every illegally used a controlled \nsubstance while possessing a security clearance (GX 2 at 7). He testified he did not \nanswer \u201cyes\u201d because he believed he would cost him his clearance (Tr. 82). \n \n \nApplicant was injured in an automobile accident in September 2005.  He was \nrear-ended by an armored car and suffered further neck injuries. He used marijuana to \nrelieve the pain about 20 times between the car accident and March 2008 (Tr. 73-75). \n   \n \nApplicant was arrested in September 2006 for possession of marijuana, \ninterfering with an officer, resisting an officer, and tampering with evidence. In an \ninterview with a security investigator in May 2007, Applicant stated he was waiting in his \ncar for a friend to join him when he was approached by a policeman and asked to step \n\n \n4 \n \n \nout of his car. Applicant had a marijuana cigarette in his pocket, which he placed in his \nmouth and attempted to swallow it. When the police held him down and were choking \nhim in their attempts to get the marijuana out of his mouth, he spit it out. Applicant hired \na lawyer, and after several postponements of his case, the charges were disposed of by \nnolle prosequi (Tr. 71-72; GX 18 at1-2; AX D at 2). The reason for the decision not to \nprosecute is not reflected in the record. \n \n \nApplicant completed another security clearance application in January 2007. As \nhe did on his previous application, he falsely answered \u201cno\u201d to the question about using \ncontrolled substances while holding a clearance (Tr. 86-87; GX 1 at 8). \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2007. According to \nthe investigator\u2019s report, Applicant admitted using marijuana from about age 15, \ncontinuing \u201cthroughout the 1990s,\u201d and using cocaine and \u201cspeed during high school \n\u201cand the years after that.\u201d According to the investigator, Applicant said he would \ncontinue to use marijuana as a pain reliever if his doctor cannot help him, and said he \ndid not care if his security clearance is revoked because of his drug use (GX 18 at 3).  \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated the security investigator \n\u201chad an attitude\u201d toward him and conducted the interview in a snack bar with workers \nwalking in and out instead of more private facilities (GX 17 at 3). On cross-examination, \nApplicant asked the investigator what she did before becoming an investigator, and she \nresponded that she was in college and obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice.  \nHe looked at her incredulously and asked, \u201cThat\u2019s the extent of it?\u201d He started to ask, \n\u201cSo you really ain\u2019t got no . . .\u201d but was interrupted by Department Counsel\u2019s objection \nand terminated his cross-examination (Tr. 56). Applicant\u2019s disdain for the investigator \nwas obvious. \n \nApplicant testified he was upset with the investigator for questioning him in a \nroom open to other people instead of a more private and appropriate environment. He \nfelt he was not treated with respect (Tr. 63). He testified that what he actually told the \ninvestigator was, \u201c[A]fter I retire, if I want to smoke marijuana, I can smoke marijuana \nbecause it\u2019s not going to affect my clearance.\u201d Tr. 62.)  \n \nApplicant also testified:  \n \nI know I told her that yes, I don\u2019t care \u2013 but I do care about my clearance. \nBut it\u2019s just the way she came across to me, she just upset me. I was in a \nbad mood that day. I was in a lot of pain and I probably said things that I \u2013 \nsome things I probably should not have said, but I\u2019m repeating myself, but \nI did. I was aggravated because I felt that she was showing no respect for \nme as a person, putting me in a room right next to the rotating door where \nthe little partition [is] up and then the candy machines in there. (Tr. 65.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified he last used marijuana about a month before \nthe hearing, in order to relieve his pain (Tr. 72). Even after multiple treatments for his \n\n \n5 \n \n \nneck injury, he still suffers a lot of pain (Tr. 88-89). In his closing statement, he \nexpressed his frustration about the conflict between his marijuana use and his \nclearance as follows:  \n \nI\u2019m not a bad person. I do things that aren\u2019t legal in the eyes of the law, \nbut at one time marijuana was legal in this country, 1936, that\u2019s when it \nbecame illegal when you made alcohol legal which is worse for you than \nany marijuana could ever be, so you guys change the rules as you feel. I \nmean if you want to take my clearance, take it. I\u2019ll just retire. . . . People \ndon\u2019t understand what pain does to people, but you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s \nlike until you get into that situation where you\u2019ve been in pain.  \n \n(Tr. 107-08.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n6 \n \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used cocaine and \u201cspeed\u201d in high school and \nthereafter (\u00b6 1.g); used marijuana from 1967 through the 1990s (\u00b6 1.b) and from June \n2006 until \u201cat least\u201d January 19, 2007 (\u00b6 1.a); and used marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance (\u00b6 1.d). It also alleges he was arresting in 1969 for breaking and \nentering with violence and that he was under the influence of LSD at the time of the \narrest (\u00b6 1.h); he was cited by customs official in 1995 for having marijuana in his \npossession (\u00b6 1.f); and he was arrested for possession of marijuana in September 2006 \n(\u00b6 1.c). It further alleges he told a security investigator in May 2007 he intended to \ncontinue using marijuana even if it affected his security clearance (\u00b6 1.e). Finally, it \nalleges he is disqualified from having his clearance renewed under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986. \n  \nThe security concern relating to Guideline H is set out in AG & 24 as follows: : \nAUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.@ \u201cDrugs\u201d include ADrugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).  \nAG \u00b6 24(a)(1). \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is Athe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.@ AG \u00b6 24(b). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied telling the security investigator he intended to \ncontinue using marijuana even if it affected his security clearance. Five months before \nthe interview, he falsified his SF 86 because he was concerned about protecting his \nclearance. If he cared about keeping his clearance in January 2007, it\u2019s difficult to \nbelieve he no longer cared about it in May 2007. Based on his displeasure with being \ninterviewed in a quasi-public place and his obvious disdain for the investigator, he may \nwell have made the statement as an expression of frustration or anger rather than a lack \nof concern about his clearance. He made a similar expression of frustration during the \nhearing, i.e., \u201cIf you want to take my clearance, take it.\u201d I conclude that he probably said \nsomething similar to what is reflected in the investigator\u2019s report, and that he intended to \ncontinue using marijuana to relieve his severe plain, but I do not believe he had stopped \ncaring about keeping his clearance. \n \nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include Aany drug abuse,@ Aillegal \ndrug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia, @ and \u201cany illegal drug use after being \ngranted a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g). The evidence in this case \nestablishes these three disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005). Applicant admitted his marijuana use at the hearing, and he did not produce \nevidence establishing any of the enumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline. \n \nUnder 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, in effect at the time the SOR was issued, the Department \nof Defense was prohibited from granting or renewing a clearance for any person who \nwas \u201can unlawful user of, or [was] addicted to, a controlled substance.\u201d National \nDefense Authorization Act for the Fiscal Year 2008, Public Law 110-181, codified in 50 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 435c, repealed 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 and replaced it with the following: \u201cAfter \nJanuary 1, 2008, the head of a Federal agency may not grant or renew a security \nclearance for a covered person who is an unlawful user of a controlled substance or an \naddict\u201d as defined by federal law. Neither the President nor the Department of Defense \nhas issued any guidance for implementing this change in the law, including any \ninstructions regarding the retroactive effect of this change. \n \nBoth 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) and its replacement in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b) use the \npresent tense, making them applicable only if the person \u201cis\u201d an unlawful user or \u201cis\u201d an \naddict. See ISCR Case No. 03-25009 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2005). Based on the evidence, \nI conclude Applicant is disqualified as an unlawful user of marijuana. He has used it for \nmost of his adult life, and used it regularly to control plain since his injuries in 1978, \n1993, and 2005. He intentionally did not disclose his marijuana use while holding a \nclearance because he knew it would cost him his clearance. He told a security \ninvestigator he will continue to use it to control his pain; he used it to control pain a \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmonth before the hearing; and he continues to be in pain, making it likely he will \ncontinue to use it. I am satisfied Applicant is a present user of marijuana within the \nmeaning of 10 U.S. \u00a7 986 and 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c. I need not decide which statutory \ndisqualification applies to Applicant, because he is disqualified from having his \nclearance renewed under either. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the drug-related criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. It also alleges an arrest and conviction for larceny in 1966 (\u00b6 \n2.j); an arrest for breach of peace and resisting arrest and a conviction of disorderly \nconduct in 1973 (\u00b6 2.i); an arrest and conviction for breach of the peace in 1975 (\u00b6 2.h); \nand an arrest for assault in the 3rd degree in 1976 (\u00b6 2.g). \n \nThe security concern under Guideline J is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: The \nconcern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d Conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime or multiple \nlesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether \nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and \n(c). Applicant\u2019s arrests and convictions raise these two disqualifying conditions. \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, \nor both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United \nStates. A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a serious \ncrime within the meaning of Guideline J. Applicant admitted falsifying his security \nclearance applications on two occasions. His falsifications were not alleged in the SOR, \nand thus may not be the basis for denying a clearance.  \n \n \nHowever, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered: A(a) to assess an \napplicant=s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant=s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, \nor changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.@ ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations \nomitted). Additionally, the Appeal Board has determined that even though crucial \nsecurity concerns are not alleged in the SOR, the Judge may consider those security \nconcerns when they are relevant and factually related to a disqualifying condition that \nwas alleged in the SOR.  ISCR 05-01820 at 3 n.4 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2006) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-18860 at 8 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2003) and ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)). I have considered Applicant\u2019s falsifications for the limited \n\n \n9 \n \n \npurposes of determining whether he is a present user of marijuana, whether he has \nbeen successfully rehabilitated, and as part of my whole person analysis. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). The allegations \ncover a span from Applicant\u2019s high school days to the present. His most recent arrest \nwas in September 2005, he falsified his security clearance application in January 2007, \nand he used marijuana a month before the hearing. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(a) is not \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns also can be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of \ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). Applicant \napparently has a good employment record, and he is actively involved in his community. \nHowever, his criminal conduct has continued until recently and his illegal marijuana use \nlikely will continue. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has worked for a defense contractor and held a \nclearance for many years. He lives in almost continuous pain from multiple injuries, and \nhe resorts to marijuana use in an effort to control his pain. He certainly deserves \ncompassion. His illegal drug use is understandable, but impermissible and inconsistent \nwith holding a clearance.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nJ, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement and \ncriminal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Even if Applicant were not statutorily disqualified from holding a \nclearance based on his current marijuana use, I would still conclude that continuing his \nclearance is not clearly consistent with the national interest, because of his criminal \nrecord and past drug abuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 8, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth Matchinski\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in amending the\nSOR; whether the Judge erred in taking administrative notice of documents containing facts\npertaining to Russia and its relations with the United States; whether Applicant was denied due\nprocess because Department Counsel acted improperly; and whether the Judge erred by not\nconsidering relevant mitigating conditions.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\n (1) The Directive provides in relevant part that:  \u201cThe SOR may be amended at the hearing\nby the Administrative Judge on his or her own motion, or upon motion by Department Counsel or\nthe applicant, so as to render it in conformity with the evidence admitted or for other good cause.\nWhen such amendments are made, the Administrative Judge may grant either party\u2019s request for\nsuch additional time as the Administrative Judge may deem appropriate for further preparation or\nother good cause.\u201d  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17.  Applicant argues that the Judge erred in granting\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR to conform with the evidence.  The Board does not\nfind this argument persuasive. \nAfter Applicant\u2019s testimony at the March 24, 2008 hearing, the government moved to amend\nthe SOR to add two allegations under Guideline B\u2014that Applicant\u2019s husband was a dual citizen of\nthe United States and Iran, and since 1996, he had traveled to Iran on at least three occasions.  In\nsupport of the motion, Department Counsel cited the lack of previous knowledge of the extent of\nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s travel to Iran and his possession of a current Iranian passport.  Based on the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns that Applicant\u2019s spouse could be at risk when traveling to Iran, and in light\nof Applicant\u2019s testimony that her spouse had been asked by his employer to surrender his Iranian\npassport, the Judge withheld ruling on the motion pending further clarification, noting that surrender\nof the passport would render future travel (to Iran) a moot issue.\nOn April 3, 2008, the government renewed its motion to amend and submitted documentation\nfrom a defense contractor indicating Applicant\u2019s spouse had not surrendered his Iranian passport as\nof April 1, 2008.  Good cause having been shown, the Judge amended the SOR as requested on April\n8, 2008.  In response, Applicant filed a document on April 30, 2008 showing that her spouse had\nturned over his Iranian passport to his employer on that date.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge acted reasonably within her\ndiscretion in granting the government\u2019s motion to amend the SOR to add the additional allegations\nunder Guideline B. \n\nSee ISCR Case No. 01-23356 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Nov. 24, 2003)(addressing the exception that is established\n1\nby Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20).\nSee Transcript at 11-13, March 24, 2008.\n2\nSee Id. at 13.\n3\n3\n(2) In DOHA proceedings, the Federal Rules of Evidence serve only as a guide.  They  may\nbe relaxed by the Judge (with one exception not applicable to this appeal ) in order to permit the\n1\ndevelopment of a full and complete record by the parties.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19.  By design, the\nDOHA process encourages Judges to err on the side of initially admitting evidence into the record,\nand then to consider a party\u2019s objections when deciding what, if any, weight to give to that evidence.\nBecause DOHA proceedings are conducted before impartial, professional fact-finders, there is less\nconcern about the potential prejudicial effect of specific items of evidence than there is in judicial\nproceedings conducted before a lay jury.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-11571 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb.\n8, 2007).  Moreover, the Board has previously noted that administrative or official notice in\nadministrative proceedings is broader than judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) citing McLeod v. Immigration and\nNaturalization Service, 802 F. 2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3  Cir. 1986).  \nrd\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in taking administrative notice of several documents\ncontaining facts pertaining to Russia and its relations with the United States.  The Board does not\nfind this argument persuasive.\nOn January 9, 2008, the government requested that administrative notice be taken of certain\nfacts pertaining to Russia and its relations with the United States.  The request was based on\npublications from the U.S. Department of State, the Congressional Research Service, the Office of\nthe National Counterintelligence Executive, the Center for Counterintelligence and Security Studies,\nand a statement for the record by the Director, Defense Intelligence Agency.  By order dated January\n18, 2008, the Judge gave Applicant until February 7, 2008, to respond to the government\u2019s request.\nApplicant did not file a response by the aforesaid date.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of both the\ngovernment\u2019s documents and the Judge\u2019s order.   At the hearing, the Judge asked Applicant if she\n2\nobjected to the Judge taking administrative notice of the facts requested by the government in the\nJanuary 9, 2008 motion.  Applicant answered: \u201cNo . . . I do not have any objections.\u201d   In light of\n3\nthe foregoing, the Board concludes that the Judge acted reasonably within her discretion in taking\nadministrative notice of the government\u2019s documents containing facts pertaining to Russia and its\nrelations with the United States.\n(3) Applicant contends that she was denied due process because Department Counsel acted\nimproperly.  In support of that contention, she argues that the Department Counsel selectively picked\nfacts to use against her, took advantage of situations that occurred during the process, and pointed\nout inconsistencies in her presentation that undermined her credibility with the Judge.  The Board\ndoes not find Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive.\n\nThe Judge made a formal finding for Applicant under one of the allegations in the SOR, i.e., paragraph\n4\n1(b).  That finding is not in issue on this appeal.\n4\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that federal officials and employees carry out their duties\nin good faith.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2001).  A party seeking to\nrebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  Applicant has not met that\nheavy burden in that she fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a\nbasis for a reasonable person to conclude that Department Counsel acted improperly, unfairly or\nunprofessionally.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 06-26704 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 2008)(no denial of due\nprocess where Department Counsel \u201csubjected [Applicant] to an aggressive cross-examination which\nelicited adverse details about his alcohol use that went beyond the specific facts recited in the SOR\nand the documentary exhibits, and undermined his credibility with the Judge\u201d); ISCR Case No. 03-\n04927 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005)(no denial of due process where pro se Applicant claimed \u201cshe\nwas no match for the \u2018very serious and prepared professionals\u2019 who represented the government\u201d);\nISCR Case No. 03-21262 at 2-3 (Jul. 10, 2007)(no denial of due process where pro se Applicant\nclaimed that \u201cDepartment Counsel raised his voice . . . and attempted to sway the Judge with\nemotional arguments\u201d).\n(4) Finally, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision should be\nreversed because she failed to closely consider relevant mitigating conditions.  Applicant\u2019s argument\nin this regard does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and considered the\npossible application of relevant conditions and factors.  She reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.   The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record\n4\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  The\nJudge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting\nBurlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962).  \u201cThe general standard is\nthat a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national\n\n5\nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Given the record that was\nbefore her, the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance decision is not arbitrary, capricious nor contrary to law.\nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \n                                                          \n1Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Nov. 18, 2007). Item I is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nApril 2, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make \nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance, and recommended referral \nto an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on November 21, 2007, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM), dated February 12, 2008, was provided to him on \nFebruary 26, 2008, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.3 Applicant\u2019s response was due on \nMarch 29, 2008. Applicant responded to the FORM on March 21, 2008. Department \nCounsel did not object to my consideration of Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM. The \ncase was assigned to me on March 31, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact4 \n \nApplicant admitted in his response to the SOR all of the SOR\u2019s allegations with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old.5 He attended one year of college in 1994. He married \nhis first spouse in 1978, and divorced in 1980. He married his current spouse in 1980. \nHe has three children, who were born in 1981, 1983, and 1984. He served on active \nduty in the Air Force from 1978 to 1998.  When he completed his security clearance \napplication (Item 4) on August 26, 2006, he described problems he had with his \nemployer concerning an improper fee-splitting arrangement for referral of new \nemployees. He concluded his explanation stating: \n \nIn retrospect, I made an incredibly bad decision accepting the referral \nmoney from [my employer] for people I did not directly refer to the \ncompany; and I truly regret that decision. [My company] has asked me to \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Feb. 19, 2008; \nhowever, Applicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated Feb. 26, 200[8]. The DOHA transmittal letter informed \nApplicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt of the FORM to submit information. \n \n4Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated Dec. 10, 2007) is the source for the facts in this \nsection, unless stated otherwise. \n \n5Item 4 (Questionnaire for National Security Positions, Standard Form 86, dated Aug. 25, 2006) is \nthe source for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherwise stated.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nreimburse them for the invalid referrals, I have agreed to do so, and [my \ncompany] and I are currently finalizing the details of my repayment plan.        \n \n \nThe improper fee-splitting arrangement is the source of the security concern in \nApplicant\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s employer had a program in which some employees \nreceived a fee or bonus for referring potential new employees that the contractor \nsubsequently hired. Some managers, including Applicant\u2019s supervisor S, were not \neligible to receive these referral fees. S referred ten potential new employees to the \ncontractor for employment; however, Applicant, who was eligible to receive the referral \nfees, received the credit and remuneration for the referrals. If two referrals were made \nwithin a 90 day period, then the contractor paid an additional bonus. Some referrals \nwere timed to maximize the bonus. After Applicant paid taxes on the bonuses he \nreceived, he split the remainder of the referral fees with S.   \n \n \nIn April 2006, allegations of improper fee-splitting arrangements surfaced and S \nresigned. On April 17, 2006, an investigator questioned Applicant about the fee-splitting \narrangement, and Applicant lied about his culpability. On April 24, 2006, after being \nconfronted with proof of the fee-splitting arrangement, Applicant admitted his \ninvolvement and resigned. He admitted that he initially lied because he \u201cpanicked.\u201d See \nFORM and Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM at 2.   \n \n \nApplicant and the contractor have been in negotiations for more than a year \nabout repayment of the approximately $46,000 he improperly accepted for referrals he \ndid not make. Applicant provided his first payment on March 12, 2008. See Applicant\u2019s \nResponse to FORM at 2. \n \nApplicant said he accepted full responsibility for his involvement in the fee-\nsplitting scheme. However, his acceptance of responsibility was equivocal. He said that \nS told him that management did not object to transfer of credit for referrals from one \nemployee to another. Applicant also provided several examples where an employee \nreceived credit for referring new employees even though that employee did not actually \nrefer the new employee to the contractor. It is unclear whether corporate management \nwas aware of these referrals. In response to interrogatories, he explained that he was \nskeptical about S\u2019 claim that management did not object to the fee-splitting arrangement \nstating: \n \nI exercised extremely poor judgment in this matter and truly regret \nmy decisions.  I had enough reservations at the time to question my ex-\nsupervisor about the propriety of what we were doing. This alone should \nhave told me that it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. However, I chose to hear \nwhat I wanted to hear and to believe that something that seemed to be too \ngood to be true, was in fact true. Reassurances from my ex-supervisor, \nalong with the fact that the money was being paid from Corporate without \nanyone saying anything, further reinforced my belief that it was OK.  After \nreflecting at length about this, I realized that what seemed to be \nharmless\u2014I was told that Corporate put that money aside for recruiting, \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nand so it didn\u2019t affect the Company\u2019s profit\u2014was actually more akin to \ntaking something to which I was not entitled. \n \nApplicant emphasized that he has learned from his mistake, and has held a \nclearance for more than 20 years with no other incidents.  Because the personnel close \nto him are aware of the incident, it could not be used to coerce or improperly influence \nhim.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d6 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \n                                                          \n6See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.

The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), 16(c) and 16(d) describe three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n                                                          \n \n7\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and, (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \nApplicant submitted false information about his role in referring employees to his \nemployer and fraudulently obtained $46,000 from his employer. See SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant deliberately lied on April 17, 2006 to his employer\u2019s investigator about his \ninvolvement in the improper fee-splitting scheme. See SOR \u00b6 1.b. AG \u00b6 16(b) applies to \nboth situations.  However AG \u00b6 16(b) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.c because his failure to \nmake restitution does not involve making false statements to his employer.8 \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s conduct is already \ncovered under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct),9 and there is no need to resort to the \ncatch-all provisions of Guideline E.  Alabama Criminal Code \u00a713A-8-2(2) is the statute \nApplicant violated. He committed a theft when he knowingly obtained by deception \ncontrol over the property of his employer, with the intent to deprive the owner of his or \nher property. Applicant knew he had done nothing to warrant payment of the fees, yet \nhe affirmatively participated in obtaining the fees and then split the money with his co-\nconspirator, S. The crime was repeated each time that he submitted a false statement \nor document to obtain the fee. As such, there is sufficient information \u201cfor an adverse \ndetermination\u201d under Guideline J.   \n \n \n                                                          \n8In the decretal paragraph of this decision, I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.c. This \nfinding does not suggest or imply that Applicant should not pay restitution or return the stolen funds. I do \nnot condone his continued wrongful withholding of his employer\u2019s funds. \n  \n9AG \u00b6 31 includes two conditions that could raise a security concern under Guideline J and may \nbe disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted\u201d both clearly apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct.   \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 apply. Applicant made a false \nstatement to his employer each time he submitted a false claim for payment of a referral \nfee, knowing he was not entitled to it. The theft was completed when he received the \nfunds because he intended to permanently deprive his employer of the employer\u2019s \nmoney. He lied to the corporate investigator in April 2006 when first confronted about \nthe thefts. He continues to deprive his employer of the funds even after being caught in \nApril 2006. His misconduct is recent.10 He did not promptly inform the government of the \nfalsifications. He attempted to mislead his employer\u2019s investigation. He did not receive \n                                                          \n10 The falsifications cannot be considered in isolation or piecemeal. An administrative judge is \nrequired to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency \nof his conduct. ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When all the falsifications are considered, the personal conduct cannot be \nmitigated under AG \u00b6 17(c).  \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \ncounseling designed to improve his conduct. Applicant\u2019s attempt to convince security \nofficials that he believed S when S told him management would not object to the fee-\nsplitting scheme is not credible. No one advised him to lie to the investigator. He \nadmitted the false statements at issue, and the falsification allegations are all \nsubstantiated. His statement that he has learned from his mistakes does not convince \nme that similar misbehavior is unlikely to recur. His falsifications cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Security concerns pertaining to \nhis personal conduct are not mitigated. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nApplicant served honorably on active duty from 1978 to 1998. The contractor \nsubsequently employed him until 2006, and there is no evidence of malfeasance \nbeyond that alleged in the SOR. His record of good employment and military service \n(aside from the SOR allegations) weighs in his favor. This shows some responsibility \nand mitigation. \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s misconduct is more substantial, and \nis thoroughly discussed under Guideline E, supra. Applicant\u2019s decisions to steal from his \nemployer and lie to the investigator were deliberate, intentional, knowledgeable, \nvoluntary, and not isolated. He was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his \nconduct. He did not receive counseling or therapy, and may not have a clear \nunderstanding about how to avoid problematic situations and why he engaged in the \nmisconduct. He has not made restitution, which reflects poorly on his rehabilitation. By \nits very nature, his misconduct calls into question his ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules and regulations. I have persistent and serious doubts about his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. He has not met his burden of establishing that his \nmisconduct will not recur. \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to personal conduct.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

    "full_text": "KEYWORD: Guideline J; Guideline E\nDIGEST: \nApplicant maintains that there is not substantial evidence of Guideline J security\nconcerns on the specific issue of whether the government proved the fourth element of the crime\nof \u201charboring\u201d under 8 U.S.C.\u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) Applicant argues that the fourth element\nrequires proof that Applicant\u2019s conduct tended to substantially facilitate the alien (his wife and\nstepdaughter) remaining in the United States illegally.  He  argues that the record does not satisfy\nthe element since: Applicant consulted an attorney (about his wife\u2019s and stepdaughter\u2019s\nsituation); who then filed pertinent forms on behalf of them with the Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement Agency and Applicant openly attempted to obtain legal status for his wife, and in so\ndoing he discussed it with the INS and his security officer. These actions exposed his wife\u2019s\nlocation and status to the INS, the DOD and the OPM. He argues that the phrase \u201csubstantially\nfacilitate\u201d means to make an alien\u2019s presence in the United States substantially easier or less\ndifficult and is tied to actions aimed at preventing the detection and apprehension of aliens. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments have merit as to Guideline J, however, the Judge\u2019s Guideline E analysis is\naffirmed.

Regarding the contents of the amendments, the hearing\ntranscript and the Judge\u2019s decision contain similar language with only minor discrepancies.  At the hearing,  Department\nCounsel alleged two violations of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324, without specifying which specific portion of  8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324 he was\nalleging.  A review of the statute reveals that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) is the specific section of the law that is\npertinent to the case.  The Judge correctly referenced this specific subparagraph of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324 in his findings of\nfact.\nThe Judge ruled in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding the SOR allegations under Guideline B.  Those favorable\n2\nrulings are not at issue on appeal.\n2\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDavid L. Hagan, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 4, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 10, 2008, at the hearing, the SOR was amended to include\nallegations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  On January\n7, 2009 after the hearing, Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (a)  whether the Judge incorrectly concluded\nthat the government established a case against Applicant for harboring his illegal alien wife and his\nillegal alien stepdaughter in violation of 8 USC \u00a7 1324 , and (b) whether the Judge erred in\n1\nconcluding that Applicant\u2019s relationships with his wife and stepdaughter were disqualifying under\nGuideline E.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision.  \n2\nThe Judge made the following findings: Applicant met his spouse, a citizen of Mexico\nillegally in the United States, at her place of employment in the United States.  Initially,  Applicant\nknew her heritage was Mexican, but he thought she was a legal resident of the United States.  After\ntheir relationship became more serious, he discovered that she was in the U.S. illegally.  Once they\nwere married, Applicant thought she could get legal residency status, but Applicant has experienced\ndifficulties in getting his wife that status.  Applicant\u2019s wife remains a citizen of Mexico living in the\nU.S. illegally.  She is subject to deportation, and, if deported, may not be eligible to return to the U.S.\nfor ten years.  Applicant\u2019s minor stepdaughter, his spouse\u2019s daughter by a previous marriage, is also\n\nApplicant concedes that the following elements of the crime of harboring are established by the evidence: (1)\n3\nthat the alien entered or remained in the United States in violation of the law, and (3) the defendant knew or recklessly\ndisregarded that the alien entered or remained in the United States in violation of the law.  Also,  Applicant concedes\nonly conditionally the second element of the crime, which he notes is circular, essentially defining harboring as harboring\n(the defendant concealed, harbored or sheltered the alien in the United States).  \n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) reads as follows: \u201cAny person who knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact\n4\nthat an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United states in violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from\ndetection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any place, including any building or any\nmeans of transportation, shall be punished as provided in subparagraph (B).\u201d\n3\nin the U.S. illegally.\nApplicant maintains that the government failed to present substantial evidence of Guideline\nJ security concerns.  Even if Applicant is persuasive on this point, however, the Judge\u2019s ultimate\ndecision is sustainable under Guideline E.\nRegarding Guideline J, Applicant asserts that the crime of \u201charboring\u201d is comprised of four\nelements.  He concedes that the government has established two of the elements enumerated, but he\ncontests the fourth element, which requires proof that Applicant\u2019s conduct tended to substantially\nfacilitate the alien (his wife and stepdaughter) remaining in the United States illegally.   Applicant\n3\nargues that the record evidence does not establish that the fourth element is satisfied, inasmuch as\nit indicates: (a) immediately after getting married, Applicant consulted an attorney about his wife\u2019s\nand stepdaughter\u2019s situation; (b) while working through his attorney (who filed pertinent forms on\nbehalf of Applicant\u2019s wife and stepdaughter with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\nAgency) Applicant openly and honestly attempted to obtain legal status for his wife, and in so doing\nhe discussed the matter with the INS and his security officer, among others; (c) these actions\nessentially exposed his wife\u2019s location and her status to the INS, the Department of Defense and the\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management; and (d) the only slim security Applicant\u2019s wife has at this\npoint is a statement from an employee at the INS that the agency has no current interest in\napprehending her.  Applicant argues that, regarding the fourth element of the crime of harboring, the\nphrase \u201csubstantially facilitate\u201d means to make an alien\u2019s presence in the United States substantially\neasier or less difficult.  Applicant also maintains that the \u201ceasier or less difficult\u201d standard is tied to\nthe defendant\u2019s actions aimed at preventing the detection and apprehension of aliens and not just\nmaking an Applicant\u2019s day-to-day life easier or less difficult.  Applicant argues that his actions in\nattempting to resolve openly his wife\u2019s immigration status have not tended to substantially facilitate\nhis wife remaining in the United States illegally, but, in fact, have had precisely the opposite effect.\nOn the specific issue of whether the government proved the fourth element of the crime of\n\u201charboring\u201d under 8 U.S.C.\u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii), Applicant\u2019s arguments have merit.4\nApplicant has correctly identified the four elements that need to be established to make out\na case under 8 U.S.C. \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iii).  The focus of Applicant\u2019s appeal is correctly on the\nmeaning of the phrase, \u201csubstantially facilitate the alien remaining in the United States illegally.\u201d\n\u201c[T]o \u2018substantially facilitate,\u2019 means to make an alien\u2019s illegal presence in the United States\nsubstantially easier or less difficult.\u201d  United States v. Shum, 496 F.3d 390, 392 (5  Cir.\nth\n\n\u201c[A]ssociation with persons involved in criminal activity.\u201d\n5\n4\n2007)(internal citation omitted).  This definition has been further refined to mean that the defendant\ntook steps that would shield an alien\u2019s identity from detection by the government. Id.  In other words,\nto obtain a conviction, the government has to prove that the defendant harbored an alien secretly or\nin hiding, rather than just proving that the defendant afforded shelter to the alien.  United States v.\nBelevin-Ramales, 458 F. Supp. 2d. 409 (E.D. Ky. 2006).  Thus, convictions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) generally involve defendants who provide illegal aliens with affirmative assistance\ninvolving shelter, transport, direction about how to obtain false documentation or warnings about\nimpending investigations.  United States v. Ozcelik, 527 F.3d 88, 99 (3d Cir. 2008).   There have\nbeen successful prosecutions under this statute for providing illegal aliens with apartments and\nimmigration papers, Unites States v. Sanchez, 963 F.2d 152 (8  Cir. 1992); for forcibly interfering\nth\nwith INS agents to prevent an alien\u2019s apprehension and assisting aliens in escaping from INS\ncustody, United States v. Varkonyi, 645 F.2d 453 (5  Cir. 1981); and for alerting illegal aliens at a\nth\nwork site of the presence of INS agents in the vicinity who were looking to apprehend them, United\nStates v. Rubio-Gonzalez, 674 F.2d 1067 (5  Cir. 1982).  The common, key element in all these\nth\ncases is affirmative action on the part of the defendant to attempt to prevent government authorities\nfrom detecting the unlawful presence of illegal aliens. \nIn this case, the evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant harbored aliens as set\nforth in 8 U.S.C.\u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii).  Since the amended SOR alleged a violation of that statute and\nDepartment Counsel has failed to demonstrate Guideline J security concerns, the Judge\u2019s adverse\nconclusion under Guideline J is not sustainable.   \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusion under Guideline E was error.  In his\ndecision, the Judge applied Guideline E Disqualifying Condition 16 (g).   Thus, the Judge\u2019s theory\n5\nunder Guideline E was not that Applicant violated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii), but that Applicant\ndisplayed questionable judgment because of his continuing association with persons involved in\ncriminal activity.  He concluded that, so long as the status of Applicant\u2019s wife and step-daughter as\nillegal immigrants remains unchanged, he could find no countervailing mitigating conditions.  In\nresponse to this, Applicant asserts: (i) that Applicant has stated clearly that he was willing, if\nnecessary, to \u201cwalk away\u201d from the relationship with his wife and stepdaughter if he could not\nfavorably resolve their immigration status; (ii) he has been truthful, candid and cooperative\nthroughout the security clearance process; (iii) the association with persons involved in criminal\nactivity does not prove questionable judgment or untrusworthiness; (iv) he was cautious and used\ngood judgment before he married his wife; (v) to suggest that he must now abandon his wife and\nstepchild in order to restore his good judgment is self-contradictory; and (vi) the government has not\nproven that he exhibited bad judgment and untrustworthiness.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not\nestablish error on the part of the Judge.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\n\n5\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, under Guideline E, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  These conclusions are reasonably supported by the\nrecord.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  Contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertion, the Judge\ncould reasonably find that his association with persons involved in criminal activity established\nquestionable judgment and/or untrustworthiness.  Moreover, the emphasis Applicant places on the\nfact that he has expressed a willingness to walk away from his wife and stepdaughter in the future\nif their immigration status is not favorably resolved is misplaced.  Generally, the Board will not hold\nthat a Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because of an applicant\u2019s statement\nthat he or she will undertake some sort of remedial action in the future.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n03-14542 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 26, 2005).    After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the\nJudge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting\nBurlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is\nthat a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national\nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Although Applicant is able\nto articulate facts that are arguably mitigating, the Board is not prepared, given the facts in this case,\nto hold that the Judge was required to find in Applicant\u2019s favor under Guideline E as a matter of law.\nTherefore, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline E is\nsustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Those favorable 2 rulings are not at issue on appeal. 2 APPEARANCES FOR GOVERNMENT James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel FOR APPLICANT David L. Hagan, Esq. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On April 4, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On September 10, 2008, at the hearing, the SOR was amended to include allegations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). On January 7, 2009 after the hearing, Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. Applicant raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge incorrectly concluded that the government established a case against Applicant for harboring his illegal alien wife and his illegal alien stepdaughter in violation of 8 USC \u00a7 1324 , and (b) whether the Judge erred in 1 concluding that Applicant\u2019s relationships with his wife and stepdaughter were disqualifying under Guideline E. For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. 2 The Judge made the following findings: Applicant met his spouse, a citizen of Mexico illegally in the United States, at her place of employment in the United States. Initially, Applicant knew her heritage was Mexican, but he thought she was a legal resident of the United States. After their relationship became more serious, he discovered that she was in the U.S. illegally. Once they were married, Applicant thought she could get legal residency status, but Applicant has experienced difficulties in getting his wife that status. Applicant\u2019s wife remains a citizen of Mexico living in the U.S. illegally. She is subject to deportation, and, if deported, may not be eligible to return to the U.S. for ten years. Applicant\u2019s minor stepdaughter, his spouse\u2019s daughter by a previous marriage, is also Applicant concedes that the following elements of the crime of harboring are established by the evidence: (1) 3 that the alien entered or remained in the United States in violation of the law, and (3) the defendant knew or recklessly disregarded that the alien entered or remained in the United States in violation of the law. Also, Applicant concedes only conditionally the second element of the crime, which he notes is circular, essentially defining harboring as harboring (the defendant concealed, harbored or sheltered the alien in the United States). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) reads as follows: \u201cAny person who knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact 4 that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in th",

Hagan, Esquire\nJanuary 7, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on December 19, 2006.  On April 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline B for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 17, 2008.  He answered the\nSOR in writing through counsel on May 1, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request soon thereafter.  This case was\nassigned to another Administrative Judge on June 6, 2008; but due to a temporary duty\n(TDY) commitment for that Judge, it was reassigned to the undersigned on August 25,\n2008.  DOHA had previously issued a notice of hearing on July 16, 2008, and I\n\nThe Government submitted two exhibits regarding Mexico, GXs 3 and 4.  However, the Government did not ask\n1\nthat the undersigned take administrative notice of any facts vis a vis Mexico.\n2\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on September 10, 2008.  The Government offered\nExhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified\non his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A and B, which were also received\nwithout objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on September 19,\n2008.  The record closed on September 10, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding Paragraphs 2 and 3,\nalleging the following:\n2. Guideline J: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nAvailable information raising this concern shows:\na. You are harboring your wife who is an illegal alien in violation of\n8 U.S.C. 1324.\nb. You are harboring your step-daughter who is an illegal alien in\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. 1324.\n3. Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgement, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  Available\ninformation raising this concern shows that:\na. You are harboring your wife who is an illegal alien in violation of\n8 U.S.C. 1324, as set forth above in 2(a).\nb. You are harboring your step-daughter who is an illegal alien in\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. 1324, as set forth above in 2(b) (TR at page 6\nline 21 to page 7 line 19).\nApplicant\u2019s counsel stipulated to the amendment (TR at page 7 line 22 to page 8\nline 10).1\n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Paragraph\n1 of the SOR, with explanations.  At his hearing, he denied the factual allegations in\nParagraphs 2 and 3.\nThe Applicant is a 40 year old electronics technician who works for a defense\ncontractor (TR at page 4 lines 12~18).  He served in the U.S. Navy for six years, from\nwhich he was honorably discharged (TR at page 20 lines 9~23).\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n1.a.  The Applicant met his spouse in the U.S., at the motel where he was staying\non a business trip (TR at page 26 line 11 to page 28 line 15, and at page 60 line 13 to\npage 61 line 22).  She worked at that motel (Id).  He knew her heritage was Mexican,\nbut he thought she was a legal resident of the U.S. (TR at page 29 line 22 to page 30\nline 8).  After their relationship became more serious, he discovered that she was in the\nU.S. illegally (TR at page 31 line 15 to page 30 line 16).  Once they were married,\nhowever, he thought she could get legal residency status (TR at page 43 line 16 to page\n46 line 17).  He was wrong (Id).  She is a citizen of Mexico, living in the U.S. illegally as\nApplicant\u2019s spouse (TR at page 57 line 9 at page 58 line 15).  She is subject to\ndeportation; and as such, may not be eligible to return to the U.S. for ten years (TR at\npage 43 line 16 to page 46 line 17).\n1.b.  The Applicant\u2019s minor step-daughter, his spouse\u2019s daughter by a previous\nmarriage, is also in the U.S. illegally (TR at page 28 line 16 to page 29 line 4).  Although\nshe is also subject to deportation; due to her being a minor, she would not be barred\nfrom returning to the U.S. for ten years (TR at page 71 line 16 to page 73 line 14).\n1.c.  The Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen of Mexico, residing in the U.S. (TR\nat page 61 line 23 to page 63 line 8).  She is remarried to a native born American, but\nApplicant is unsure of her immigration status; i.e., whether she is in the U.S. legally (Id).\n1.d.  The Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and four brothers-in-law are citizens and\nresidents of Mexico (TR at page 64 line 6 to page 66 line 6).  The Applicant has spoken\nto his father-in-law once on the phone, but has never spoken to his brothers-in-law (Id).\nHe has no idea what they do for a living (TR at page 64 line 6 to page 66 line 6).\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct & Guideline E - Personal Conduct\n2.a., 2.b., 3.a. and 3.b.  The Applicant is knowingly harboring two illegal\nimmigrants, his spouse and his step-daughter, in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii).\nUnder 8 U.S.C. 1324(a)(1)(B)(ii), the Applicant is subject to a \u201cfine\u201d and/or imprisonment\nfor \u201cnot more than 5 years.\u201d\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nParagraph 6 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Influence: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern\nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a foreign interest.\u201d\nHere, Paragraph 7(a) is applicable: \u201ccontacts with a foreign family member . . .\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  The\nApplicant\u2019s spouse and step-daughter are Mexican nationals residing in the U.S.\nillegally.  This is countered, however, by the first Mitigating Condition, as \u201cthe nature of\nthe relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located . .\n. are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  The\nApplicant\u2019s situation is an unusual one.  So long as his spouse and step-daughter reside\nwith the Applicant in the U.S., there is little likelihood of any attempt at coercion by\nMexico or any other government.  As to his other Mexican relatives, he has little, if any,\ncontact with them.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nParagraph 30 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Criminal Conduct: ACriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.@\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out certain conditions that could raise security\nconcerns.  Paragraph 31(c) provides that an \u201callegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted,@ may raise security concerns.  Here, I can find no countervailing Mitigating\nCondition, as the Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, harboring two illegal immigrants, is\nknowing, continuing conduct.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe adjudicative guidelines also set out the security concern relating to Personal\nConduct: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could\nindicate that the person may not properly safeguard information.\u201d\nHere, the last Disqualifying Condition applies, \u201cassociation with persons involved\nin criminal activity.\u201d  His spouse and step-daughter are illegal immigrants.  So long as\n\n6\ntheir illegal status in this country remains unchanged, I can find no countervailing\nMitigating Condition.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.

Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Applicant began working in the Defense industry in October 2005. Beginning in 1989, and continuing until 2000, the Applicant was a successful small businessman who ran his own company. Applicant\u2019s Company (AC) provided services to various clients, but he had one primary client (Client). The AC was grossing approximately $2 million in sales by 1998. Over the next two years (1998-2000), a change in management at the Client brought an end to the Applicant\u2019s relationship with them. Without the Client\u2019s business, AC could not remain in business. By 2000, the AC had been dissolved.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nAugust 22, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on October 28, 2005.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  On January 28, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 17, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was ready to proceed on\nApril 7, 2008.  The case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge on\nApril 10, 2008.  I received the case assignment on April 21, 2008.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on April 25, 2008.  \n\nSubparagraph 1.b. contains a typographical error which has been corrected by striking the date \u201cDecember\n1\n2007\" and substituting the date \u201cDecember 2000.\u201d  This comports with the evidence.\n2\nThe hearing was convened on May 15, 2008.  The Government offered\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received without objection. Applicant\ncalled one witness, testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\nthrough R, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on June 3,\n2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 53 and married.  He is employed by a Defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment in the Defense\nindustry.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant began working in the Defense industry in October 2005.\nBeginning in 1989, and continuing until 2000, the Applicant was a successful small\nbusinessman who ran his own company.  Applicant\u2019s Company (AC) provided services\nto various clients, but he had one primary client (Client).  The AC was grossing\napproximately $2 million in sales by 1998. Over the next two years (1998-2000), a\nchange in management at the Client brought an end to the Applicant\u2019s relationship with\nthem.  Without the Client\u2019s business, AC could not remain in business.  By 2000, the AC\nhad been dissolved.  Because of the nature of his business, the Applicant had to agree\nto be personally responsible for many of the corporate debts.  This fact, and a complete\nloss of income, forced the Applicant into bankruptcy in 2000.   (SOR subparagraph 1.b.)\n1\n(Transcript at 47-54, 62-84; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits H-Q.)\nFrom 2000 through 2005, in particular between 2003 and 2005, he had several\nlow paying jobs as he looked for permanent employment and his income was very\nerratic.  He currently makes less money than he did when he owned his business.\n(Transcript at 84-87, 90.)  This time period was very difficult for the Applicant, who has a\nfamily.  He testified, \u201cWhat I am trying to say is I want to make it clear that that [inability\nto pay his bills] really had nothing to do with me being unwilling or unable to live within\nmy means because I had no means to live within.\u201d  (Transcript at 87.)\nThe Applicant began working for the Defense industry in October 2005.  He has\nbeen able to consistently pay his current debts since beginning employment.  All of the\nindebtedness dates to the period when he was unemployed or underemployed.  The\nApplicant submitted a credit report showing charged off debts, which the Applicant paid\nafter becoming employed in 2005, and before issuance of the SOR.  The Applicant\nstated, \u201cI did the best I could during my rough years; and, then after I got past those\nrough years, I went and tried to make good on what I could make good on.\u201d  (Transcript\nat 101-102; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)\n\nPursuant to motion by the Department Counsel, Subparagraph 1.a. was amended by striking the figure\n2\n\u201c$16,798\" and substituting the figure \u201c$57,000.\u201d  This comported with the evidence introduced at the hearing.\n(Transcript at 139.)\n3\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owes the Federal Government\n$57,000.00 in back payroll taxes, interest and penalties.   The debt dates from when he\n2\nowned his company.  The Applicant has continually been in contact with the IRS, letting\nthem know his employment and financial situation. (Transcript at 90-94, 125-132;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  In their latest communication with the Applicant, dated May 12,\n2008, they state, \u201cAll of the tax accounts . . . have been placed in a non-collectible\nstatus at this time due to your current financial situation. Being placed in this status\nmeans that we will not take any collection action on the amount that you owe until your\nfinancial status changes.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 4.)  The Applicant\u2019s situation is\nchanging because his children are grown and he can downsize his house and\nexpenses.  He hopes to be able to begin to pay the IRS soon.  (Transcript at 135-137.)\nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant admits having had a State tax lien in the\namount of $2,640.00.  The taxes were paid and the lien released in December 2005.\n(Transcript at 94-95; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  \nSubparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant firmly believed that he did not owe a utility\ncompany $173.40.  After much research, he was unable to find proof of payment.  In\norder to resolve the debt he paid it.  (Transcript at 100, 132-133; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)\nSubparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant denied currently owing a cable company\n$26.70.  He presented a statement from the collection agency showing that the payment\nhad been made in December 2005, soon after the Applicant was employed in the\nDefense industry.  (Transcript at 99-100; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)\nSubparagraph 1.f.  The Applicant was in a long term dispute with this hospital\nand his insurance company over the amount he owed for medical care after an\naccident.  He had paid a substantial amount of this medical debt, and believed that the\nrest would be handled by his insurance company.  In order to resolve this debt he paid\nit.  (Transcript at 97-99, 133; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)\nSubparagraph 1.g.  The Applicant submitted a copy of the Personal Financial\nStatement that he submits to the IRS in connection with his tax liability.  This is based\non the Applicant\u2019s actual expenses over a three month period.  This exhibit shows a\nmonthly net remainder of $218.00, not over $1,000 a month.  (Transcript at 96-\n97;Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \nThe Applicant submitted that his current financial situation is stable.  He is able to\npay his current debts and is in communication with the IRS about his unpaid tax\nliabilities.  His financial difficulties were over a limited time, and he has paid the rest of\nhis debts.  \n\n4\nMitigation\nA co-worker of the Applicant, who was an employee in the Applicant\u2019s company\nand is a friend, testified on the Applicant\u2019s behalf.  He describes the Applicant as,\n\u201cextremely trustworthy, responsible, above reproach.\u201d  (Transcript at 55.)\nThe Applicant submitted letters from supervisors and other people he works with.\nThese people have the \u201chighest confidence and trust\u201d in him.  His immediate supervisor\nstates that, \u201chonesty, truth and integrity are sound descriptions of his character.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG &19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns.\nThere is evidence in the record that the Applicant has a $58,000.00 tax lien for taxes\nrelated to his failed business.  He also owed several other, smaller, bills.  The evidence\nis sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that it may be mitigating if \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . a business downturn . . .),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\n\n6\n The majority of the Applicant\u2019s past due indebtedness was incurred between\n2000 and 2005 when the Applicant\u2019s company failed and he had five years of sporadic\nemployment and fluctuating income.  As described at length above, once the Applicant\nwas employed in the Defense industry, he began working to pay his past due\nindebtedness.  Specifically, in addition to the debts in the SOR, he paid several\ncreditors not mentioned in the SOR even though his debts had been charged off.  Since\nbeing employed in the Defense industry, he has been able to pay all of his current\ndebts.  I find the behavior occurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur, it also occurred because of a business downturn, and it does not raise\nconcerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence\nraises this potentially mitigating condition.\n \nAG \u00b620(c) applies if \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control.\u201d  Evidence that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts@ is also mitigating under \u00b620(d).  \nThe Applicant has successfully paid off all of the debts in the SOR but one.  He\nhas not ignored his Federal tax liability, rather the record shows that he has maintained\nclose and continuing contact with the IRS.  The records submitted by the Applicant\nshow the IRS understands his financial situation and intends no collection efforts at the\ncurrent time.  The Applicant expresses a credible intent to resolve the Federal tax\nliability at the earliest time he can.  I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions\napply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The record shows that the Applicant\nhad a successful career and business before his current problems began.  He is\nrespected in his current job.  \nThe Applicant, by his own admission, had debt problems between 2000 and\n2005.  The reasons are described at length above.  Rather than avoid his debts, once\n\n7\nhe obtained steady and well-paying employment in the Defense industry, he began\nworking to pay his debts.  I have considered the large amount of his tax debt and find\nthat it can be mitigated in that he has been in contact with the IRS, which obviously\nbelieves that the Applicant is doing the best he can.  He has behaved reasonably and\nappropriately in trying to resolve his debts, thereby AG \u00b6 2(a)(6) applies.  Under the\nparticular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little to no potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the likelihood of recurrence is\nclose to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 48-year-old, married man with one adult child. Both he and his wife are professional truck drivers. He has an eighth grade education (Tr. 34). In 1997, Applicant and his wife started a trucking business. They financed the purchase of two eighteen-wheelers for approximately $230,000. Typically, they drove one together, and either leased the other or hired employees to drive it (Tr. 46, 49). The business struggled. Applicant and his wife had trouble finding competent employees, and they underestimated the vehicles\u2019 maintenance costs (Tr. 46). When his wife experienced a serious medical crisis in 2001, everything \u201csnowballed\u201d (Tr. 25). Because they had no medical insurance, they incurred tremendous out-of-pocket health care expenses and grew increasingly unable to pay their business expenses. In October 2000, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection (Exhibit D). The court discharged approximately $290,000 of business and personal debt (Exhibit D at 11). Although Applicant and his wife had to return one of the trucks to the creditor as part of the bankruptcy process, they were able to continue operating the business. They failed, however, to set aside funds in an escrow account to pay their federal income taxes (Tr. 50). In 2002, they were unable to pay them when due (Id.). With the help of their accountant, Applicant and his wife arranged an installment plan and paid an average of $200 per month (Tr. 49-51, 64). Applicant a",

During the hearing, I received three government exhibits, three Applicant exhibits,\nand the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. Applicant attempted to move a fourth\nexhibit, a 43-page document, into the record. Department counsel objected because\nshe had not seen it before the hearing. I identified it as Exhibit D, reserving judgment on\nApril 17, 2008\n\n2\nits admissibility until department counsel had an opportunity to review it after the\nhearing. At the hearing\u2019s conclusion, I left the record open to allow Applicant the\nopportunity to submit additional exhibits.

Also, Applicant\nsubmitted two additional exhibits within the time allotted, which I incorporated into the\nrecord. I received the transcript on February 27, 2008.

Both he and his wife\nare professional truck drivers. He has an eighth grade education (Tr. 34).\nIn 1997, Applicant and his wife started a trucking business. They financed the\npurchase of two eighteen-wheelers for approximately $230,000. Typically, they drove\none together, and either leased the other or hired employees to drive it (Tr. 46, 49).\nThe business struggled. Applicant and his wife had trouble finding competent\nemployees, and they underestimated the vehicles\u2019 maintenance costs (Tr. 46). When\nhis wife experienced a serious medical crisis in 2001, everything \u201csnowballed\u201d (Tr. 25).\nBecause they had no medical insurance, they incurred tremendous out-of-pocket health\ncare expenses and grew increasingly unable to pay their business expenses.\nIn October 2000, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection\n(Exhibit D). The court discharged approximately $290,000 of business and personal\ndebt (Exhibit D at 11). \nAlthough Applicant and his wife had to return one of the trucks to the creditor as\npart of the bankruptcy process, they were able to continue operating the business. They\nfailed, however, to set aside funds in an escrow account to pay their federal income\ntaxes (Tr. 50). In 2002, they were unable to pay them when due (Id.). With the help of\ntheir accountant, Applicant and his wife arranged an installment plan and paid an\naverage of $200 per month (Tr. 49-51, 64).\nApplicant and his wife were again unable to pay their federal income taxes in\n2003 and 2004. They arranged installment plans for those years also (Tr. 50). In 2003,\nApplicant and his wife \u201csaved up and splurged\u201d on two Caribbean vacations (Tr. 42,\nExhibit 1).\nWhen Applicant and his wife were unable to pay their federal income taxes in\n2004, their accountant advised them that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not\nallow taxpayers to arrange installment plans for more than three consecutive years (Tr.\n51). They then did not file their 2004 income tax return (Tr. 56).\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s wife experienced another major medical problem in 2005 (Tr. 70). In\nearly 2006, they filed their 2004 and 2005 income tax returns. At that time, they had\npaid approximately $2,735 toward the 2002 and 2003 delinquencies through the\ninstallment plans (Exhibit E). Through their accountant, they then began negotiating an\noffer and compromise (Tr. 57). \nThe accountant worked on a settlement with the IRS for approximately a year\nbefore quitting abruptly (Tr. 57). In December 2007, the IRS froze Applicant and his\nwife\u2019s bank account, obtained a lien against their property for $61,838, and began\ngarnishing Applicant\u2019s wages (Exhibit C, Tr. 29). Currently, he has paid approximately\n$970 through the garnishment (Exhibit B). The bank account remains frozen (Tr. 29,\n33). \nOver the years, Applicant incurred three delinquent medical expenses,\ncollectively less than $800, related to on-the job injuries (SOR subparagraphs 1.b\nthrough 1.d). He satisfied the delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b (Exhibit F).\nSOR subparagraph 1.c remains unpaid and SOR subparagraph 1.d is in dispute.\nApplicant and his wife have retained another accounting firm to help resolve the\ntax delinquencies (Exhibit A). Their goal is to satisfy the tax delinquencies, then \u201cmove\non to a plan that will pay the medical [bills]\u201d (Tr. 25).\nApplicant has not sought money management counseling. Recently, he read a\nself-help book by a prominent money management expert, and has been incorporating\nthe book\u2019s lessons into their daily financial plan (Tr. 35). Applicant and his wife estimate\ntheir delinquencies will be satisfied in three years.\nApplicant and his wife ended their business in 2005. Since then Applicant has\nbeen working for the same company.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems, and failure to file his 2004 federal\nincome taxes on time triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts,\u201d 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d 19(e), \u201cconsistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,\u201d\nand 19(g), \u201cfailure to file Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required.\u201d I have\nconsidered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were originally caused by his struggling business and his wife\u2019s illness. When\nthey became overwhelming, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2000.\nShortly after the court discharged his debts, however, his financial problems recurred. In\n2003, as he was increasingly losing control of his finances again, he spent money on\ntwo Caribbean vacations. Consequently, although Applicant\u2019s problems were originally\ncaused by circumstances beyond his control, he did not deal with them responsibly.\nApplicant acknowledges that his financial problems recurred because of\nirresponsibility. He has outlined a debt repayment plan, and has retained an accounting\nfirm for assistance. However, the plan is sketchy at best, and the only payments he has\nmade thus far have been through a wage garnishment. I conclude Applicant\u2019s finances\nremain a security concern.\n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s struggling business and his spouse\u2019s major medical problems\ncontributed to his financial problems. His limited education was also a factor. His\nfinancial problems recurred after a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. Although he has\ntaken steps to get his finances under control, it is too soon to conclude they no longer\npose a security concern in light of the remaining amount of the delinquencies and their\nrecurrent nature. Evaluating this case in the context of the whole person, I conclude\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems remain a security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In the SOR as amended at hearing, DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes delinquent debt of about $53,569 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i), and that a judgment of $5,761 had been awarded against him in May 2001 that he paid off in July 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.f, as amended). In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts with the exception of the $627 in \u00b6 1.i. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 48-year-old line operator who has worked for a defense contractor most recently since December 2003. He makes fiber optic cable and runs a crew of six (Tr. 36). He had previously worked for the company from February 1988 to September 2002 when he was laid off (Ex. 1, Tr. 35-39). He held a security clearance until November 2007 when it was withdrawn pending final adjudication of his clearance. He seeks a security clearance for access to secure areas of the facility (Tr. 37-38). On graduating from high school, Applicant enlisted in the United States Air Force (Tr. 35). He served on active duty from November 1979 to September 1987, and then went to work for his present employer (Ex. 1). He held a security clearance while in the military (Tr. 38). Applicant sent his mother $20,000 from his savings when she needed knee surgery following a fall at her home that he recollects happened in 1999 or 2000 (Tr. 28, 42-44).

On October 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 2, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 16, 2007, and indicated he did not want a hearing. On\nDecember 7, 2007, the government notified Applicant of its request for a hearing before\nan administrative judge pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the Directive. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on January 4, 2008. On January 10, 2008, I scheduled a hearing\nfor February 14, 2008.\nMarch 26, 2008\n\n2\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Before the introduction of any evidence,\nthe government withdrew SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.g (duplicate listing of \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and\n1.c, respectively). The government then moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.f to allege that\nApplicant was indebted to the listed creditor as the result of a district court judgment\nentered in May 2001 in the approximate amount of $5,761 until that judgment was\nsatisfied in July 2005. The motions were granted without any objections from Applicant.\nFour government exhibits (Ex. 1-4) and two Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-B) were received\ninto evidence without objection and Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) received by DOHA on February 27, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR as amended at hearing, DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations, that Applicant owes delinquent debt of about $53,569 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b,\n1.c, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i), and that a judgment of $5,761 had been awarded against him in\nMay 2001 that he paid off in July 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.f, as amended). In his response to the\nSOR, Applicant admitted the debts with the exception of the $627 in \u00b6 1.i. After\nconsideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old line operator who has worked for a defense contractor\nmost recently since December 2003. He makes fiber optic cable and runs a crew of six\n(Tr. 36). He had previously worked for the company from February 1988 to September\n2002 when he was laid off (Ex. 1, Tr. 35-39). He held a security clearance until\nNovember 2007 when it was withdrawn pending final adjudication of his clearance. He\nseeks a security clearance for access to secure areas of the facility (Tr. 37-38).\nOn graduating from high school, Applicant enlisted in the United States Air Force\n(Tr. 35). He served on active duty from November 1979 to September 1987, and then\nwent to work for his present employer (Ex. 1). He held a security clearance while in the\nmilitary (Tr. 38).\nApplicant sent his mother $20,000 from his savings when she needed knee\nsurgery following a fall at her home that he recollects happened in 1999 or 2000 (Tr. 28,\n42-44). She lacked health insurance to cover the cost (Tr. 28, 44), even though she was\nemployed as a janitor in a retirement home (Tr. 43). Applicant was behind in some of his\npersonal credit card obligations when he gave his mother the $20,000 (Tr. 45). When\nshe needed another surgery about a year or so later, he sent her another $5,000 (Tr.\n44, 46). He borrowed the money from a friend and repaid it in a lump sum in about early\n2006 (Tr. 46).\nSome of Applicant\u2019s consumer credit accounts began to fall delinquent in about\n2000, even though he was employed full time. In about December 2000, a credit card\nlender filed for a judgment to collect a $4,813 charge-off balance. In May 2001, the\nlender obtained a $5,761 default judgment against Applicant (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant was\n\n3\npermitted to make monthly payments of $100 on the debt at his request (Ex. 2, Tr. 55-\n56).\nAs of January 2001, Applicant owed a charged off balance of $12,919 on a credit\ncard account that was $2,345 past due (SOR \u00b6 1.c). As of October 2002, the debt had\nrisen to $14,866 and was in collection (Ex. 4). Another credit card lender reported a\n$4,096 charged off balance as of January 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). In June 2002, it was\nplaced for collection with its current assignee (Ex. 4).\nIn about August 1999, Applicant took out an unsecured loan of $5,318. It was\nrefinanced in July 2001 with a balance of $5,477. In about May 2002, the creditor\ncharged off a balance of $6,568 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (Ex. 4).\nAfter a job layoff in July 2002, Applicant was unemployed until his employer\nrecalled him in December 2003 (Ex. 1). He collected unemployment compensation of\nabout $300 every two weeks, which went to pay for rent, telephone, and food (Tr. 57-\n58). Had he been working, his earnings would have been about $500 to $600 per week\n(Tr. 57-58). Struggling financially (\u201cI was broke. I had no money at all.\u201d Tr. 68),\nApplicant stopped paying on his court judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.f) in April 2003. He was\nordered to pay $2,500 immediately and then $100 monthly thereafter. Applicant cashed\nin his pension of about $25,000 (Tr. 55-56), which went to paying the $2,500 (Tr. 56)\nand living expenses (Tr. 67-68).\nIn about January 2003, Applicant opened a wireless telephone account in his\nname for a 17-year-old goddaughter as a birthday present. The girl\u2019s mother had\npromised to pay the $29 monthly fee (Ex. 4, Tr. 52). The girl incurred substantial\ncharges and her mother didn\u2019t pay the bills (Tr. 53-54). Applicant confronted her about\nthe nonpayment but she still refused to pay (Tr. 52-53). A $627 debt balance was\neventually placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.i) (Ex. 4). In about 2002 or 2003, Applicant lent\n$3,000 to a friend who did not repay him (Tr. 78-79).\nOn his return to work in December 2003, Applicant made no effort to pay his long\ndelinquent debts as he had fallen behind in other bills during his 18 months of\nunemployment (Tr. 29). He stopped making his $100 monthly payments on the\njudgment debt in about August 2004, and he was ordered to appear at a contempt\nhearing in July 2005 (Tr. 56). Applicant paid a settlement amount in excess of $1,000 in\nJuly 2005 to fulfill his obligation to the creditor. He used some of his pension monies to\npay the debt (Tr. 56-57).\nIn or before June 2004, Applicant opened a telephone services account in his\nname for a girlfriend who had bad credit (\u201cYou do stupid things when you\u2019re in love.\u201d Tr.\n54). In January 2005, the creditor placed a $211 debt balance in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a)\n(Ex. 4).\nOn October 13, 2006, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Sensitive\nPositions (SF 86) in application for a security clearance. He responded affirmatively to\n\nA collection agency took on the debt in June 2006 (Ex. 4). Applicant admitted the debt when he answered\n1\nthe SOR, but testified at his hearing that he did not recognize the debt and thought he had only one account\n(SOR \u00b6 1.f) with the original creditor (Tr. 49). This debt was not reported by Equifax in a subsequent credit\ncheck in September 2007 (Ex. 3), but it appears on the consolidated credit report of October 2006 (Ex. 4).\n4\nquestions 28A. \u201cLAST 7 YRS, OVER 180 DAYS DELINQUENT ON ANY DEBTS?\u201d and\n28B. \u201cCURRENTLY OVER 90 DAYS DELINQUENT ON ANY DEBTS?\u201d and listed an\nunpaid credit card balance of $6,568.24 since January 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  He also\nreported under question 29 concerning any civil actions in the past seven years that he\nhad been under court order to repay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f at $100 monthly (Ex. 1).\nAs of October 25, 2006, the credit bureaus reported Applicant owed several\ndelinquent balances in collection: $211 on SOR \u00b6 1.a, $19,415 on SOR \u00b6 1.c, $9,726 on\nSOR \u00b6 1.e, $16,109 (original installment account debt $6,922) on SOR \u00b6 1.h,  and $627\n1\non SOR \u00b6 1.i. The delinquent debt Applicant had reported on his SF 86 was listed as\ncharged off with a balance owed of $6,568 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant was reportedly\npaying a revolving charge with a credit union on time and it had a balance of $2,279.\n(Ex. 4) In early 2007, he began contributing 10% of his pay to his pension at work (Tr.\n67-68).\nOn July 18, 2007, DOHA asked Applicant to provide documentation of any\nrepayment efforts, to complete a personal financial statement, and to furnish copies of\nhis last two pay stubs. He responded on September 4, 2007, submitting a personal\nfinancial statement reflecting a net remainder of $976.26 monthly after payment of\nexpenses and $150 toward a $1,629.55 balance on a credit card account with a credit\nunion (Ex. 2). Applicant\u2019s reported income included daily overtime earnings (Tr. 64-65).\nHe provided no indication of any efforts to resolve his delinquent debts (Ex. 2).\nIn September or October 2007, Applicant lent $5,000 to a teenage goddaughter\nat her request so that she could buy a car. He borrowed the $5,000 from a friend who\nwants it repaid in a lump sum within two years (Tr. 48-49, 70-72, 75-82). The\ngoddaughter has been repaying Applicant at $100 per month (Tr. 80-81), but as of mid-\nFebruary 2008, Applicant has not repaid the $5,000 he borrowed (Tr. 48). The girl\u2019s\nmother is taking care of Applicant\u2019s cellular phone charges for him \u201cto get the payment\ndown\u201d in return for the favor (Tr. 74-75).\nEquifax Information Services reported on September 27, 2007, that Applicant\nowed collection debts of $7,481 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $211 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $1,395 on a\ncredit card account that was current (Ex. 3). Applicant obtained a copy of his credit\nreport and he began contacting his creditors in October 2007. On October 17, 2007, the\ncollection agency servicing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b offered to settle the $7,593.17\nbalance on receipt of a lump sum payment of $4,555.90 by November 16, 2007 (Ex. B).\nOn October 22, 2007, Applicant paid another collection agency $627.43 to satisfy the\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.i (Ex. A). In December 2007, the assignee attempting to collect the\n$19,415 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c offered to settle for about $7,000 (Tr. 60).\n\n5\nAs of mid-February 2008, Applicant was still working on saving the money to\nsettle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b (Tr. 31). Due to a 3.1% increase in his pay (Tr. 77),\nApplicant had accumulated $4,400 in his checking account. He had set $3,000 of it\naside for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b and the rest was intended for bills (Tr. 69).\nApplicant plans to repay his debts as quickly as he can (tr. 34). As of February\n2008, he was working eight to 12 hours of overtime per week. Over the past three\nyears, his overtime hours have averaged out to two days per week (Tr. 39-40).\nApplicant estimates about $176 remaining each month due to less overtime than in\nSeptember 2007 (Tr. 65-67). Applicant will provide financial assistance to this family\nmembers (primarily his mother) in the future if necessary. He might put $100 in his\nmother\u2019s purse when he goes to see her but does not send her any money on a regular\nbasis (Tr. 47). Over the years he has been \u201cburned\u201d at least once a year by friends who\nhave not repaid funds borrowed from him. He does not intend to lend money to friends\nin the future (Tr. 78-79). Applicant has not opened any new credit card accounts in the\npast few years (Ex. 3, Ex. 4, Tr. 73).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative jdge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n6\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquency since about 2000. While a debt\nthat went to court judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.i) was eventually satisfied with pension monies,\nabout $52,000 in delinquent debt was still outstanding when he applied for his clearance\nin October 2006. As his indebtedness continued to mount (e.g., the debt balance of\nSOR \u00b6 1.b alone went from $6,568 to $7,481 by September 2007), he borrowed $5,000\nfrom a friend that he has not repaid. Significant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to him giving his mother $25,000 \u201clike\nbetween 2000\u20141999 to 2001, 2002\" when she needed two surgeries and had no\ninsurance coverage, and to him being unemployed for 18 months after a job layoff.\nUnforeseen medical emergency and unemployment are circumstances that implicate\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\n\n7\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances\u201d). Applicant admits he was behind in at least some\nof his obligations before the situation with his mother arose, and he offered no credible\nexplanation for his failure to remain current when he had about $20,000 in savings. Yet,\nhis gift of monies to his mother was reasonable under the circumstances, and there is\nno evidence that Applicant knew he was going to be laid off when he depleted his\nsavings account to help his mother.\nAfter he returned to work in December 2003, Applicant satisfied the court\njudgment (SOR \u00b6 1.f) in July 2005 and a telephone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i) in October 2007.\nRepayment of a court judgment in response to a contempt citation does not qualify for\nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d), but his October 2007 attempts  to make payment\narrangements with his creditors and his satisfaction of the debt in \u00b6 1.i predate his\nreceipt of the SOR. While these efforts were in good faith, they are too recent to enable\nthe affirmative finding that Applicant is likely to resolve his financial issues in the near\nfuture. The debt balance is substantial in relation to his income. As of February 2008, he\nreported about $176 remaining after payment of his monthly expenses. Even if he were\nto manage to settle the debts for less than their full amounts, it would take several years\nbefore he paid them off.\nApplicant has also made poor financial decisions in the past few years that raise\ndoubts for his judgment and reliability. Knowing he had several outstanding delinquent\ndebts and one court judgment to satisfy, Applicant lent money to others when he could\nnot afford to do so.  A friend who borrowed $3,000 from Applicant in 2002 or 2003 left\ntown without repaying him. In about June 2004, Applicant opened a wireless telephone\naccount in his name (SOR \u00b6 1.a) for a girlfriend who had bad credit. When she failed to\nabide by her promise to pay, he \u201cgot silly and didn\u2019t make the payments.\u201d (Tr. 51-52)\nMore recently, in September 2007 he borrowed $5,000 from a friend so that his 17-year-\nold goddaughter could buy herself a vehicle. Applicant testified with no rebuttal from the\ngovernment that she is repaying him at $100 per month plus her mother is covering the\ncost of his cell phone in return for the favor. However, he has to repay his lender the\n$5,000 in a lump sum by September 2009. There is no evidence that he is setting the\n$100 aside for that purpose. He testified he has $4,400 in checking, $3,000 of which is\nintended to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and the remainder is for bills (Tr. 69). Applicant\nnow promises to refrain from lending money to friends in the future because he has\nbeen \u201cburned at least once a year\u201d (Tr. 78), but that is not enough to overcome the\nsubstantial financial considerations concerns that exist in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant lost his job through no\nfault of his own when he had no savings to draw on. He is entitled to a reasonable\nperiod of time to reestablish himself financially, and there is no evidence that he is\nbehind in his day-to-day obligations. However, during the past four years he has\nrepeatedly put himself and his friends before his obligations to his creditors. Given the\nextent of his unresolved debt and his track record of questionable financial decisions, I\nam unable to conclude at this time that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant him access.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                           \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.  \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on August 29, 2007, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on November 1, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 29,\n2008, and the hearing was scheduled for February 27, 2008. At the hearing the\nGovernment presented seven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7.\nThe Applicant called one witness and presented twelve exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through L.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The official\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on March 6, 2008.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 29 years old and has a high school\ndiploma and an Associates Degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Flight\nSimulator Maintenance Technician and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  He was\nindebted to eight separate creditors totaling approximately $10,261.00.  Credit reports of\nthe Applicant dated June 2007, August 2007, and October 2007 reflect each of these\ndelinquent debts.  (See Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4 and 5).\nThe Applicant was married in 1999, and honorably discharged from the Marine\nCorps in March 2000.  He was unemployed for three months, until June 2000, before he\nfound a job.  During the three month period of unemployment, the Applicant claims that\nhe became financially indebted.  When he started working he had to take a pay\ndecrease.  His annual income at that time was less than $40,000 and was insufficient to\npay off his debts.  His wife was employed and contributed to the household expenses\nuntil 2003. In 2004, their daughter was born and his wife now stays at home to take care\nof their child.  \nIn October 2005, the Applicant started working full time for his current employer\nand his pay has increased over time.  The Applicant is also working a part-time job. The\nApplicant indicates that he now earns $88,000 annually, and that he has approximately\n$11,000 in a 401K.  \nIn February 2008, the Applicant paid off two of the debts listed in the SOR.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits I and J).  He paid off the debt listed in allegation 1(a), to Calvary in\nthe amount of $183.00 and the debt listed in allegation in 1(c), to Midland in the amount\nof $862.00.  The Applicant indicates that the debt alleged in 1(b) of the SOR is the same\ndebt alleged in 1(c).  He has not yet paid the debts listed in allegations 1(d) through\n1(h), which total approximately $9,500.00.  He has no intention to pay several of them\n1(e) and 1(f), because they are so old.  (Tr. p. 72).     \n\n3\nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, the Applicant is also indebted to the Internal\nRevenue Service and the state taxing authorities for back taxes.  He indicated that he is\ncurrently making monthly payments to both the IRS and the state for back due taxes for\n2006.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G and H).  He recently filed his income tax returns for\n2007, and he owes the IRS approximately $1,919.00 and the state $834.00 for tax year\n2007.  (Tr. p. 77).    \nHe sought out credit counseling by going to a debt consolidation website.  His\nhopes were to consolidate his debt and make one monthly payment to his creditors.  He\nwas told by the credit representative that he is only $3,209.00 in debt because the debts\nlisted in allegations 1(e), 1(f), and 1(h) are so old and are no longer reflected on his\ncredit report.  The fees to use the consolidation service are $1,100.00 and so the\nprogram would not benefit his situation.  (Tr. pp. 78-79).\nThe Applicant took out a loan out against his 401K in the amount of $3,300 in\norder to get the transmission on his truck repaired.  He is currently in the process of\nrepaying this loan which will be paid off in June 2008.  He is considering taking out\nanother loan against it to pay off his delinquent debts.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F). \nThe Applicant submitted a credit report dated August 2007 that does not reflect\nall of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L). \nLetters of recommendation from various individuals who work with the Applicant\nincluding his direct supervisor, the company human resource coordinator, a pilot\ninstructor, a co-worker who has the same job as the Applicant, a senior field engineer\nand others collectively indicate that the Applicant is one of the most trusted and highest\nqualified Simulator Technicians in the company.  He is reliable, responsible and\ntrustworthy and a man of honor and integrity.  He is an instrumental asset to the facility\nand his background, expertise and knowledge is difficult to obtain.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit K).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\n\n4\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the\nfollowing general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2\nof Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nto grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient\nperiod of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an\nacceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is\n\n5\nthe careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.\nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant has recently paid two of the delinquent\ndebts listed in the SOR.  In regard to the remaining debts, they are still outstanding.\nThe Applicant has not contacted the creditors nor has he set up a payment plan to\nresolve the debts.  Although several of the debts are old, meaning they were incurred\nand became delinquent over seven years ago, all but one of his credit reports still reflect\nthem as owing.  He has not contacted the credit reporting agencies to dispute the debts.\nSeveral of the debts he has no intent to pay.  He remains excessively indebted in an\namount in excess of $9,500.00.       \nUpon review of his financial report, it appears that he has some disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay his delinquent bills.  Under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts, and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations are applicable.  None of\n\n6\nthe mitigating factors apply.  His financial problems remain current, they are not\nisolated, and the Applicant has not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  Until recently, the Applicant has ignored his delinquent debts.  He paid off\ntwo of them and then just left the others.  It appears that he is waiting for the others to\nfall off of his credit report in hopes that he does not have to pay them.  \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Thomas Albin, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological \nConditions). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application on November 12, 2002, \nand she received a clearance about five years ago. The exact date of her clearance is \nnot reflected in the record. On May 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to revoke her clearance, citing security concerns under Guideline I. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 21, 2008; answered it on \nMay 27, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received \nthe request on May 29, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 12, \n2008, and the case was assigned to me on June 13, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on July 2, 2008, scheduling the hearing for July 24, 2008. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AX), which was admitted without objection. The record closed upon \nadjournment of the hearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 7, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 1.d. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old electrician employed by a defense contractor (Tr. 26). \nShe has worked for her current employer and held a clearance for more than five years.   \n \n \nApplicant has a history of mental health problems. Her parents were divorced \nwhen she was about four years old, as a result of her father\u2019s brutal assault on her \nmother. Her father moved away and she saw him again only once, when she was seven \nor eight years old. Her mother remarried when she was about five or six years old (GX 2 \nat 2). When Applicant was a young teenager she was partially responsible for \ndisciplining her younger sister, who retaliated by harassing Applicant, putting needles in \nher bed or chemicals in her face soap (GX 2-3). \n \n \nWhen Applicant was about 16 years old, she tried to control her anxiety and \npanic by burning herself. She did so on two or three occasions. (GX 3 at 2-3). Her \nmedical records reflect a suicide attempt by a drug overdose in high school (GX 3 at \n135). \n \n \nApplicant now has a \u201cgood and bad\u201d relationship with her mother. On the one \nhand, her mother is very critical and hurtful, and she discloses inappropriately intimate \nfinancial and marital information to Applicant. On the other hand, Applicant finds that \ntalking with her mother is one of her best ways of controlling her emotions. Applicant \ntalks to her mother about once a week and more frequently when under stress. She told \na clinical psychologist that when she is with her family she reverts to being \u201cthat sad, \n16-year-old teenager\u201d (GX 2-3). \n \n \nApplicant grew up on the west coast. She moved to the east coast and her \npresent workplace when her husband was transferred. Shortly after she moved to the \neast coast, her insurance stopped paying for her medications and she stopped taking \nthem (Tr. 23, 41).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant and her husband separated after about 18 months of marriage. In June \n2003, she reacted to the stress of her pending divorce by shaving her head and \nattempting suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. The attempt did not work, \nand she awakened in the morning suffering from nausea and dizziness. She went to \nwork, where her co-workers noticed her condition and notified her supervisor. She was \nhospitalized in a mental health ward for three days. Upon discharge, she was diagnosed \nwith major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, without psychotic features. She was \ngiven prescriptions for medication and advised to obtain counseling (GX 2 at 5; GX 3 at \n6, 128, and 138). \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant, not yet divorced, became pregnant by a man married to \nanother woman. She miscarried after about four and a half months. In May 2004, she \nweighted down her clothing, walked to a pier, and started running toward the water. As \nshe approached the end of the pier; she decided she did not want to die and stopped. \nShe then went to the hospital for help. She was hospitalized for five days and diagnosed \nwith major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features (GX 2 at 4; \nGX 3 at 75, 99).  \n \n \nIn May 2006, Applicant was temporarily assigned to a shipyard on the west \ncoast, near her family. She had difficulty at work and believed her boss was critical of \nher. She lived with her family, which revived her family-related stresses (Tr. 33-34). She \nstopped taking her medications because she lost contact with her doctor. She had \nmisplaced his telephone number and could not remember his name (GX 3 at 9). In late \nMay 2006, when she started having suicidal thoughts and began burning herself to \nrelieve the stress, she voluntarily sought psychiatric help at a local hospital. She was \ntreated and released, but she did not go to work for two days (GX 3 at 9) \n \nWhen Applicant returned to work, she learned she was about to be disciplined for \nmissing work. She returned to the hospital, upset because she thought she was about \nto be fired. She was hospitalized in the mental ward for four or five days and diagnosed \nwith post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic; and bipolar disorder, depressed, without \npsychotic features (GX 3 at 88). She was given prescriptions for medications and \nreleased. She reacted badly to her medications, suffering numbness and loss of \nbalance. The dosages were reduced and the adverse reactions ceased (GX 2 at 4; GX \n3 at 7-8).  \n \n \nApplicant started seeing her current psychologist and psychiatrist in July 2006. \nTheir initial diagnosis was bipolar disorder I (GX 3 at 79, 82). \n \nApplicant stopped taking her medications for about a month in November 2006. \nShe starting hitting herself and trying to burn herself. She was taken to her psychologist \nby a co-worker after she acted like a \u201czombie\u201d at work and was crying (GX 3 at 155). \n \n \nBetween early February 2007 and mid-March 2008, the observations of \nApplicant\u2019s psychologist after every session included a comment that her insight was \ncompromised (GX 3 at 13-47). In late October 2007, Applicant\u2019s psychologist noted she \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhad stopped taking one of her medications, and he was concerned about the risk of \nbipolar symptoms (GX 3 at 26). In December 2007, her psychologist again noted she \nwas not taking her medications unless absolutely necessary, and he wanted her to \nresume taking them regularly to minimize the risk of bipolar symptoms (GX 3 at 21). In \nearly January 2008, her psychologist again noted that she was \u201cnot fully compliant\u201d with \nher medications (GX 3 at 19-20). In late January 2008, her psychologist noted that she \nwas \u2018compliant with her meds\u201d and feeling much better (GX 3 at 18).  \n \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant\u2019s drug prescriptions were destroyed when her truck \ncaught fire. She attempted to obtain new prescriptions but her doctor did not return her \ntelephone calls. Since she had an appointment in two weeks, she decided to \u201ctough it \nout\u201d until her appointment. She described this decision as a \u201cbig mistake,\u201d because not \ntaking her medications made her physically sick. She testified she had no thoughts of \ninjuring herself during this period because she was too sick (Tr. 72).  \n \n \nIn January 2008, the Department of Defense referred Applicant to a clinical \npsychologist for evaluation. This evaluation apparently was triggered when her \nhospitalization on the west coast was reported to her supervisors and the facility \nsecurity officer (Tr. 57-58). The government psychologist diagnosed her with bipolar I \ndisorder, most recent episode depressed, severe without psychotic symptoms; and \npost-traumatic stress disorder (GX 2 at 5). His evaluation included the following \ncomments: \n \n[A]pplicant\u2019s presentation at this interview suggests no currently significant \ndefects in judgment or reliability. When symptomatic, the picture is less \nclear. In reviewing her history, when symptomatic [Applicant\u2019s] patterns of \nsuicidality and self-harm signify defects in judgment; however these tend \nto focus on and may even be confined to behaviors that are self-directed. \nNo evidence reviewed by this interviewer suggests that she has directed \nany unhealthy behaviors at elements in the workplace. Therefore, though \nsuch lapses in judgment may be present when symptomatic, these may \nbe confined to self-care (GX 2 at 8). \n \nThe government psychologist also noted that the cyclical nature of Applicant\u2019s \ndisorder is likely to cause some impairment in occupational functioning that could range \nanywhere from a distracted day to inability to function. He concluded that \u201cit is difficult to \npredict what levels of severity might occur in light of Applicant\u2019s current levels of \ntherapeutic support,\u201d and that Applicant \u201ccould be viewed a struggling with a chronic \nillness whose severity will depend on such factors as adherence to recommended \ntreatment and environmental stressors.\u201d  \n \n \nIn mid-June 2008, one of Applicant\u2019s co-workers asked her about her apparent \nincreased weight, causing Applicant to \u201cstress out,\u201d She called her psychologist, talked \nto him, and resolved her distress without thoughts of harming herself (Tr. 82-83).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had been in a serious relationship with a \nsecurity guard for a government facility for about a year. They have known each other \nfor about four years (Tr. 89). They see each other every four days on his day off (Tr. 24-\n25).  \n \nOn July 1, 2008, about three weeks before the hearing, Applicant and her \nboyfriend had an argument that made her want to escape from the situation. She \nresponded by consuming all the ten remaining pills from one of her medications and she \ntried to consume all the pills of a second medication. Her boyfriend knocked the second \nmedication out of her hand and took her to a hospital, where she was administered a \ncharcoal solution that filtered out the medications. She was held overnight and then \nreleased (Tr. 46-50). She stayed with her boyfriend for three days and then returned to \nwork (Tr. 52). Her boyfriend testified and corroborated her account of the incident (Tr. \n90-97). \n \nOn July 15, 2008, Applicant\u2019s clinical psychologist and her psychiatrist reported \nthat she was being treated for bipolar I disorder and that she had responded well to \npsychotropic medication during the past two years (AX A). They were aware of her drug \noverdose two weeks earlier (Tr. 67). Nevertheless, they stated, \u201cHer prognosis is good \nat this time as noticed by the way she has made good use of the supports provided to \nher.\u201d  \n \nAddressing a concern alleged in the SOR about adhering to her treatment \nprogram, Applicant\u2019s psychologist and psychiatrist also stated that she kept all her \nappointments except on rare occasions when she had car problems, concerns about \ndemonstrating a good work record, or major family events (AX A at 1). Applicant \ntestified she is \u201ctoo afraid\u201d to stop taking her medications (Tr. 79). \n \nApplicant sees her psychologist once a week, and she sees her psychiatrist \nevery one or two months (Tr. 34-36). Her medications are constantly being adjusted in \nan effort to find the correct balance (Tr. 37, 43-44). According to her psychologist, her \nmedications were reviewed 23 times during a two-year period (AX A).  \n \nApplicant also has started seeing a counselor to whom she was referred through \nthe employee assistance program, in addition to her regular psychologist and \npsychiatrist (Tr. 58-61). She testified she started seeing this counselor to have a second \nopinion and because the counselor \u201cseems to be more on the feeling side of the \nspectrum,\u201d compared to her regular psychologist, who is more clinical (Tr. 81). \n \nApplicant testified she does not \u201cfit in quite well\u201d at her workplace. She filed a \ncomplaint against a boss who molested her in 2003, and she believes her co-workers \ntreated her unkindly because they thought she might file complaints against them as \nwell (Tr. 79). She has been transferred to a job where she has less contact with her co-\nworkers (Tr. 62-63). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s support system consists of her psychologist, psychiatrist, her newest \ncounselor, her mother, her boyfriend, and a co-worker who has experience in \ncounseling. She called the co-worker when she had bad side effects from her \nmedications while on the west coast, and he advised her to return to the hospital, which \nshe did (Tr. 84). Her boyfriend testified they \u201ctalk a lot\u201d about her mood swings and her \nstress at work and with her family (Tr. 101). \n \n \nApplicant testified her employer is aware of her mental health issues. She \nprovided the employer\u2019s medical facility with her list of medications, notified her union, \nand sought help through the company\u2019s employee assistance program (Tr. 58-59). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was diagnosed in January 2008 with bipolar I \ndisorder (most recent episode depressed, severe without psychotic symptoms) and \npost-traumatic stress disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that she has received treatment and \nmedications since July 2006 for post-traumatic stress disorder I and bipolar disorder II \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); that she has periodically stopped taking medications and attending therapy \nsessions against medical advice (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that, as a result of her mental health \ndisorders, she was treated or hospitalized for self-mutilation and suicidal thoughts, \ngestures, or attempts in November 2006, June 2006, May 2006, May 2004, and June \n2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \n \n \nWith respect to SOR \u00b6 1.b, alleging a diagnosis of \u201cPost Traumatic Stress \nDisorder I and Bipolar Disorder II,\u201d the DSM IV does not list post-traumatic stress \ndisorder with a Roman numeral suffix, and all the evidence of record shows Applicant \nwas diagnosed with bipolar disorder I, not bipolar disorder II. With respect to SOR \u00b6 1.c, \nthere is evidence that she stopped taking her medications, and there is evidence she \nsometimes rescheduled therapy sessions for good cause, but there is no evidence she \nsimply failed to attend her therapy sessions. In all other respects, the allegations in the \nSOR have been established by substantial evidence. \n \nThe security concern under Guideline I is set out in AG \u00b6 27 as follows: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of seeking mental health counseling. \nA potentially disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \n\u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness that \nis not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to emotionally \nunstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, paranoid, or bizarre behavior.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n28(a). A potentially disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201can opinion by a duly \nqualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition not covered \nunder any other guideline that may impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \n\u00b6 28(b). Applicant\u2019s mental health history raises these two disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated if \u201cthe identified condition \nis readily controllable with treatment, and the individual has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan.\u201d AG \u00b6 29(a). Although Applicant is \nundergoing therapy, receiving medications, and has established a support structure, \nshe has not established that her condition is \u201creadily controllable.\u201d Her medication is still \nbeing adjusted, and her suicide attempt on July 1, 2008, demonstrates that her \ncondition is not yet under control. She has generally complied with her therapy \nschedule, but there have been periods where she has not taken her prescribed \nmedications. Some of those periods were beyond her control, such as the time when \nshe could not afford the medications, the time on the west coast when she could not \ncontact her prescriber, and the time when her prescriptions were destroyed by the truck \nfire; but there is no apparent good reason for her failure to take her medications during \nthe periods from late October 2007 through early January 2008. I conclude AG \u00b6 29(a) \nis not established. \n \nSecurity concerns also can be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has voluntarily entered \na counseling or treatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the \nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional.\u201d AG \u00b6 29(b). Applicant is voluntarily receiving \ntreatment. Her condition appears to be \u201camenable to treatment,\u201d but not fully \ncontrollable. She is receiving counseling and has received a favorable prognosis from \nher psychologist and psychiatrist, but it is conditioned on her continued use of \u201cthe \nsupports provided to her.\u201d The government psychologist\u2019s prognosis is much more \nguarded. Nevertheless, I conclude this mitigating condition is applicable. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a relatively young woman who has spent about half her life dealing \nwith her mental health issues. She has cooperated with and responded to treatment and \nmedication, but she remains very fragile. The two episodes occurring in mid-June and \nearly July demonstrate how easily a drastic mood swing can be triggered. When she is \nsymptomatic or stops taking her medications, her insight and judgment are impaired. \n \n \nApplicant has reacted to her mood swings in self-destructive ways. As noted by \nthe government psychologist, her actions are not directed at other persons or her \nworkplace. She responds to stress with sadness, crying, and self-destructive behavior. \nNevertheless, her fragility makes her very vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, \nor duress. Her condition is chronic and can be expected to persist, albeit in a somewhat \ncontrolled manner, for the foreseeable future. There is a significant likelihood of \nrecurring unhealthy behavior triggered by unexpected stressors. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline I, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on psychological conditions. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I (Psychological Conditions): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all SOR allegations with explanations. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s demeanor, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 30-year-old program analyst employed by a government contractor (Tr. 40). She received an Associate\u2019s Degree in Business Management in December 2007 (Tr. 5), and expects to complete her Bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009 (Tr. 96). She married her first spouse in November 1998. They separated in 2001, and divorced in 2003 (Tr. 38). She has two children from this marriage, ages 8 and 9 (Tr. 39). Applicant and her ex-husband share custody of their children and she receives no alimony or support. Applicant married her current spouse in May 2008 (Tr. 39). Applicant\u2019s work history (GE 1) reflects she has been, for the most part, consistently employed since 1996 to the present as a program analyst and an executive administrator. In September 2006, she was hired by her current employer, a government contractor, and would like access to sensitive information to work on government contracts. Since 1996, she has been unemployed only during a one month period in 2003 (Tr. 98, GE 1). Applicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial problems and past criminal behavior.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) (GE 1) on \nOctober 10, 2006. On October 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nMay 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                     \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 20, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on February 14, 2008. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing the next day. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nMarch 4, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted exhibits (AE) 1 \nthrough 7, which were received without objection.2 DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on March 12, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all SOR allegations with \nexplanations. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s demeanor, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old program analyst employed by a government contractor \n(Tr. 40). She received an Associate\u2019s Degree in Business Management in December \n2007 (Tr. 5), and expects to complete her Bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009 (Tr. 96). She \nmarried her first spouse in November 1998. They separated in 2001, and divorced in \n2003 (Tr. 38). She has two children from this marriage, ages 8 and 9 (Tr. 39). Applicant \nand her ex-husband share custody of their children and she receives no alimony or \nsupport. Applicant married her current spouse in May 2008 (Tr. 39). \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history (GE 1) reflects she has been, for the most part, \nconsistently employed since 1996 to the present as a program analyst and an executive \nadministrator. In September 2006, she was hired by her current employer, a \ngovernment contractor, and would like access to sensitive information to work on \ngovernment contracts. Since 1996, she has been unemployed only during a one month \nperiod in 2003 (Tr. 98, GE 1). \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial problems and past \ncriminal behavior. It included a review of her August 2007 response to DOHA \ninterrogatories (GE 2), and the review of credit bureau reports (CBRs) from October \n2006 (GE 4), and July 2007 (GE 3). The SOR alleges 12 delinquent/charged off \naccounts totaling approximately $16,600.3 The debts are well supported by the record \nevidence. At her hearing, consistent with her answers to the SOR, Applicant confirmed \nthese are her debts and they are still outstanding.  \n \n \n2  AE 7 was submitted post-hearing. I kept the record open until April 4, 2008, to allow Applicant \ntime to submit additional documentation. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum, stating no objections to \nme considering Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission is included in AE 7. \n \n3  Applicant explained, and the Government conceded, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. f and 1.j are the same account \n(Tr. 25-26). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn December 2006, a government investigator confronted Applicant about her \ndelinquencies. During that interview, Applicant promised to begin resolving her \ndelinquent debts by contacting creditors, paying some of her debts, and establishing \npayment plans for others. Applicant presented little evidence of any efforts taken to pay \nor otherwise resolve her debts since the day she acquired them until after she received \nher SOR in October 2007.  \n \nApplicant explained she went through a rough financial period from 2001 to \nSeptember 2006. During that period she separated from her first husband and later they \nwere divorced. She was providing care and support for herself and her children. Her \nearnings were inadequate, around $32,000 a year and she relied on her credit to pay for \nday-to-day living expenses and other debts. As a result of these factors, and the higher \ncost of living, she acquired many debts which became delinquent because she did not \nhave the means to pay for them. Most of those delinquent debts remain delinquent to \nthe present, and are alleged in the SOR.  \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant was hired by her current employer and received a \nsalary increase of around $18,000. Since 2006, she has been earning approximately \n$54,000 a year. Applicant claimed for the last three years she has been working hard \nrepairing her credit, paying delinquent debts and making settlement agreements. \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of payments made to any creditors, \nsettlement agreements, or of any efforts to resolve her debts prior to receipt of her SOR.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts include credit card accounts, personal loans, unpaid \nutility services, and a medical bill. Six of the delinquent debts listed could be considered \nsmall debts because the total owed per debt is less than $1,000. Since October 2007, \nApplicant has made payments on some of her delinquent debts and established \nsettlement agreement for a few others. Applicant admitted she never contacted any of \nthe creditors prior to October 2007, because she did not have the money to pay the \ndebts (Tr. 46-47, 106). \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.a ($4,418), Applicant explained she paid her car insurance \nin a monthly basis. While on work related travel, she allowed a friend to use her car \nwhich was uninsured. He was involved in an accident and damaged a utility pole. She \ncould not afford to pay for the utility pole, and the debt was referred for collection. At her \nhearing she claimed she entered into a payment agreement around October 2007, and \nthat she has been making monthly payments of $100 for a total of $500 (Tr. 43-44). Her \ndocumentary evidence shows she paid $100 in March 2005; four payments of $75 in \nJanuary 2007; one $50 payment in October 2007; and one payment in March 2008 \n(AEs 5, 6). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,154) is an outstanding delinquent debt. It was acquired as a result \nof a broken apartment lease. While leasing the apartment, Applicant paid the rent late, \nbut claimed she did not issue worthless checks to the landlord (Tr. 48). The owner filed \na judgment against Applicant in May 2004. She never attempted to settle the debt \nbecause she did not have the money and they refused to settle for less than full \n\n \n4 \n \n \npayment. She claimed she contacted the debt collector after October 2007, but they \nhave not sent her any documents (Tr. 46). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($757) and 1.d ($1,642) are collections for Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ncredit card accounts. SOR \u00b6 1.c has been in collection since 1999 (Tr. 109-110). She \nclaimed she made settlement agreements with both debt collectors and that she paid \n$100 on each account. She presented no evidence to support her claims (Tr. 50, 57, \n111). \n \nApplicant alleged she established a payment agreement in October 2007 with the \ndebt collector for SOR \u00b6 1.e ($2,239), and that she has been making payments. The \nevidence shows she has made one $50 payment (AE 5, p. 5). She presented no \nevidence of a settlement/payment agreement or additional payments. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($297) and 1.j ($340) alleged the same delinquent account. She \nclaimed she has made some payments after receipt of the SOR (Tr. 27). She presented \nno evidence to corroborate her claims. Concerning SOR \u00b6 1.g ($645), Applicant claimed \nshe recently contacted the creditor to establish a payment plan. She presented no \nevidence to support her claim (Tr. 113). \n \nApplicant paid off SOR \u00b6 1.h ($570) with payments in January and February \n2008 (AE 6). Concerning SOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,115), Applicant initially testified she did not \nrecognize the creditor. However, during cross-examination she remembered this was \none of her delinquent credit card accounts (Tr. 56, 58, 114).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($2,109) was Applicant\u2019s cell phone account which became \ndelinquent. Because she did not have the money to pay it, she just ignored it until she \nreceived the SOR (Tr. 59-60). At her hearing, she claimed she paid $200 and that she \npromised to pay it in full before May 1, 2008. Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence shows \nshe paid $100 on March 3, 2008 (AE 5). She also provided the debt collector with a \npostdated check to be deposited on March 27, 2008 (AE 6).  \n \nApplicant claimed she did not recognized SOR \u00b6 1.l ($95). GEs 3 and 4 show \nthat in 2003 Applicant issued a $70 worthless check to a medical provider and has \nfailed to make it good (Tr. 61-62). SOR 1.m ($1,645) is a delinquent debt for medical \nservices Applicant received. She claimed she was provided the bill for her co-payment \ntwo years after she received the services and stated is disputing the claim. She has not \ndisputed the claim through proper channels, and has done nothing to resolve the debt \n(Tr. 63-64). \n \nIn addition to the above debts, Applicant has a $17,000 student loan that will \nrequire payments beginning in 2009 (Tr. 96). In June 2007, Applicant agreed to a \n$78,000 judgment by default (Tr. 73-81). Apparently, while working as a bookkeeper, \nshe was accused of stealing $30,000. Applicant vehemently denied any criminal \nmalfeasance. She admitted, however, to causing the loss of money through her \nnegligence. The judgment included $35,812 in punitive damages, attorney fees, and \n\n \n5 \n \n \npre-judgment interest on promissory notes signed by her (GEs 5, 6). She also owes \n$20,000 to her current husband for an equity loan she took to pay for one of her cars \nand other debts (Tr. 85). \n \nApplicant expressed numerous times her willingness and intent to pay her \ndelinquent debts; however, at the present she cannot afford to do so. Her monthly \nexpenses far exceed her net monthly income of approximately $2,800 (Tr. 88). In April \n2007, she started working in real estate. She claimed in 2007 she made $8,000 in \ncommissions for two property sales, and that she applied that money towards payment \nof her $78,000 judgment and other debts. She presented no evidence to support this \nclaim. Her plan is to use part of her future real estate commissions\u2019 income to pay her \ndelinquent debts.  \n \nShe considered consolidating her debts once, but she would rather pay the debts \nherself and not have to pay additional interest and fees. Applicant presented no \nevidence of any measures she has taken to avoid future financial difficulties. There is no \nevidence she has ever sought or received financial counseling. \n \nBetween 1999 and 2004, Applicant issued five bad checks (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2a, b, d, e, \nand f). She claimed many of the bad checks were caused by her financial problems, \nand because of her and her ex-husband\u2019s failure to coordinate funds and issuing checks \nfrom a joint check account. Although she has been charged with criminal offenses for \nuttering the bad checks, Applicant was never prosecuted because she paid the bad \nchecks before trial (Tr. 35).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a concerns two $7,500 checks she post-dated and issued to a friend to \npay him for a $14,000 loan she received to pay another debt (Tr. 65-66). She claimed \nher friend needed the money and cashed the check before the check\u2019s post-date.  \n \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 2.c, Applicant explained she paid her car insurance on a \nmonthly basis. While on work related travel, she allowed a friend to use her car which \nwas uninsured, and he was involved in an accident. Applicant re-insured her car and \nthen filed an insurance claim for the accident (Tr. 36, 69-71, GE 2). The insurance \ncompany discovered her car was not insured at the time of the accident and asked to be \nreimbursed the claim money. Applicant had paid for the car repairs, and did not have \nthe money. She was arrested and charged with theft. She plea bargained to a charge of \n\u201cFalse/Misleading Information,\u201d paid $9,700 in restitution, and served two days jail. \n \nApplicant received solid recommendations from her current facility security \nofficer, business operations manager, co-worker, and supervisor (AEs 1-4). She is \nconsidered to be a hard-working and dedicated employee. In general, they believe she \nis trustworthy, and a dependable and reliable employee. They recommended her for a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nHaving observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor, and considering her testimony in light of \nthe record evidence, I find Applicant\u2019s testimony was less than candid. She minimized \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \nher questionable behavior and failed to take full responsibility for her actions. She was \nnot credible in her testimony concerning the efforts she took to resolve her delinquent \ndebts. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.4 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d5 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n \n4  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n5  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                     \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an Applicant\u2019s  \n \nfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nAs of her hearing date, Applicant has 12 delinquent debts, including three \njudgments, which have been charged off or in collection for many years, totaling \napproximately $16,600. AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 \n19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201cconsistent \nspending beyond one\u2019s means . . .\u201d), apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG & 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions (MC), and the record \nevidence as a whole,6 I conclude that none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant \npresented little evidence of efforts taken to contact creditors, or to resolve any of the \ndebts since she acquired them up until receipt of the SOR. Nor is there any evidence \nthat she has participated in any financial counseling.  \n \n \nI specifically considered AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cThe conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \n \n6  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\u201d and AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d), and \nconclude that they apply, but only to a limited extent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony raised mitigating factors that may be considered as \ncircumstances beyond her control contributing to her inability to pay her debts, i.e., she \nwas a divorced mother of two, received no child support, and acquired many of her \ndebts as a result of her divorce. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient \nto show she has dealt responsibly with her financial obligations. She presented little \nevidence to show paid debts, settlement agreements, documented negotiations, \npayment plans, budgets, financial assistance/counseling before receipt of the SOR.  \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(d), I considered Applicant recently started making payment \nagreements and paying some of her debts. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s financial history \nand lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that she has established a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. She failed to establish that she received financial \ncounseling, and that the problem is being resolved or is under control (AG \u00b6 20(c)). She \nalso failed to provide documentation that she properly disputed the legitimacy of any of \nthe debts (AG \u00b6 20(e)). Based on the available evidence, her financial problems are \nrecent, not isolated, ongoing, and are likely to be a concern in the future. Moreover, \nApplicant is financially overextended and has engaged in illegal acts to overcome her \nfinancial problems. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nFrom 1999 and 2004, Applicant issued five bad checks (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2a, b, d, e, and \nf), and was arrested and charged with uttering worthless checks. Additionally, she was \nfound guilty of \u201cFalse/Misleading Information\u201d for falsifying an insurance claim, and was \naccused of theft while working as a bookkeeper. Taken together, these incidents create \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment, and her ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Criminal Conduct disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted,\u201d apply. \n \n \nAG & 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 31(a). After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find \nthat none apply. Her criminal behavior is recent, the circumstances that caused her \nquestionable behavior (financial problems) are still present in Applicant\u2019s life, and her \nquestionable behavior is likely to recur. Moreover, having observed Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor, and considering her testimony in light of the record evidence, I find \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was not fully candid and forthright, and that she tried to minimize \nher questionable behavior. In sum, she lacks credibility and is not trustworthy. \nApplicant\u2019s overall behavior cast serious doubts about her judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. Furthermore, her lack of \ncredibility and honesty show Applicant has not learned from her mistakes, that her \nquestionable behavior is likely to recur, and such behavior cast doubts on her \nrehabilitation. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a),  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, educated and \nhard-working employee. She has been successful working for a defense contractor for \napproximately two years. Her character references recommended she receive a \nsecurity clearance. During the last two years working for her employer, she has earned \na reputation as a trustworthy, reliable, and dependable employee. Notwithstanding, as \npreviously discussed under Guidelines F and J, Applicant\u2019s financial problems, criminal \nbehavior, and lack of credibility and trustworthiness outweigh her favorable information. \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from her financial considerations and criminal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 12, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on March 7, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 21, 2008, scheduling the hearing for \nApril 16, 2008. Applicant requested a continuance on April 4, 2008, which was marked \nJune 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. Department Counsel did not oppose the continuance and it was \ngranted until May 8, 2008. DOHA issued an amended notice of hearing on April 15, \n2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 8, 2008. The Government called \none witness and offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through \nM, which were received without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the \nrecord open until June 13, 2008, to submit additional matters through Department \nCounsel. Applicant submitted nine documents which were marked AE N though V, and \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is HE II. The record closed on \nJune 13, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 16, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since early in 2005. She has an Associate\u2019s degree and is \ncurrently enrolled in college seeking a Bachelor\u2019s degree. She served on active duty \nwith the United States Navy from 1983 through 1995, and was honorably discharged as \na second class petty officer. She was selected for first class petty officer but was \ndischarged before she was promoted. She enlisted in the Air National Guard in 2004, \nand has served since. She was married in 1985 and divorced in 1992. She remarried in \n1993 and divorced in 1997. She has two adult children.1  \n \n \nApplicant has never received child support from the father of her two children. \nShe spent much of her Navy career serving overseas. Her second husband was also in \nthe Navy. Because they were both in critical fields, it was difficult to be stationed \ntogether. She chose not to remain in the Navy so they could stay together as a family. \nAfter her discharge, she remained where her husband was stationed outside the \ncontinental United States (CONUS). She returned to CONUS in 1997, pending the \ndivorce from her second husband. She experienced periods of unemployment then and \nagain in about 2001 or 2002. She attributed her financial difficulties to raising two \nchildren on a limited income. She also helped support her four-year-old granddaughter.2   \n \n \nApplicant enrolled in a credit service in December 2007. The service works to \nclear misreported information from Applicant\u2019s credit report and negotiates settlements \nwith her creditors. Applicant then pays the creditors directly without going through the \ncredit service. She paid an initial fee of about $409 to the company, through payments \nof $109.95 in December 2007, $150 in January 2008, and $149 in February 2008. The \ncompany issued her a \u201ccredit kit\u201d which included brochures and compact disks on \nmanaging her credit. The company also charges a monthly fee of $12.95. The company \nadvised her not to make payments on her debts until they arrived at settlement \nagreements with the creditors.3   \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 26-36; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 29-41; AE K. \n \n3 Tr. at 48-59; AE A, G, P. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe SOR lists six debts totaling approximately $12,000. Applicant essentially \nadmitted to owing all the debts, but disputed several of the amounts. Individual debts \nare discussed below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a lists a debt of $4,513 to a credit union for a loan. Applicant admitted \nhaving a loan with the credit union, but stated that she thought she paid the loan. The \ndebt is listed on all the credit reports in evidence. Applicant listed this debt on her \nsecurity clearance application (SF 86) dated March 7, 2005, and listed the debt as \ndelinquent since October 1998. She wrote that the amount owed was $4,000; that she \nmade $3,000 in payments in 2004; and that she was \u201c[c]urrently making arrangements \nto bring account up to date.\u201d There is no evidence that she did anything to make the \naccount current. When she responded to the SOR, she attached a copy of a billing \nstatement from the credit union. She wrote on the statement that she \u201cattempted to set \nup monthly payment\u201d and that she was \u201crepresented by [credit service] and waiting for \ntheir advice/response.\u201d Applicant testified she has an agreement to pay the credit union \n$100 per month and that her first $100 payment was due May 19, 2008. She provided \ndocumentation that she made one payment of $100 on June 5, 2008.4  \n \n \nThe debt of $1,314 in SOR \u00b6 1.b is for a credit card. Applicant submitted a \nstatement from a different creditor showing a payment of $61 on July 21, 2007, and a \nbalance of $952. She hand wrote that this debt was incurred through the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. The account numbers for the two debts are different and there is nothing to \nsuggest they represent the same debt, other than Applicant\u2019s statement. Applicant listed \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b on her security clearance application dated March 7, 2005. She \nlisted the debt as delinquent between January 1999 and February 2005. She wrote that \nthe amount owed was $1,250 and that the debt was current as of February 2005. She \nsubmitted a personal financial statement (PFS) when she responded to DOHA \ninterrogatories on September 28, 2007. On the PFS, she listed both the creditor named \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b and the credit card identified with the second creditor. She wrote that she \nwas making monthly payments of $20 on both debts, and that the debts were \u201ccurrent.\u201d \nShe also listed on the PFS that she has $3,000 in bank savings. The account number \nassociated with the underlying debt is listed with a different collection company on the \ncredit reports dated November 28, 2006 and November 9, 2007. Both reports show the \naccount as paid. The debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b has been deleted from Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport. There is insufficient evidence for a finding that this debt remains delinquent. The \nevidence suggests that it was either paid before November 2006, or was transferred to \na different creditor with a balance of $943 as of November 2007.5 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debt of $250 to a collection company on behalf of a \nwireless telephone company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. She testified that the debt was \ndown to $190, and that she made a payment of $100 the day before the hearing to \nreduce the debt further to $90. She stated that she would not have any documentary \nevidence to show the payment until her check cleared the bank. She was asked to \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 23-25, 41-43, 55; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3-5; AE B, J, S. T. \n \n5 Tr. at 43; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1-5; AE C, J, V. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nsubmit evidence of the payment after the hearing. Applicant did not provide proof of the \n$100 payment in her post-hearing submission. Instead she provided a copy of a \nsettlement offer from the collection company, which stated the company would accept \n$125 as settlement of their $250 debt. Applicant circled the amount of $125 on the \nsettlement letter and wrote \u201cpd.\u201d She also wrote \u201cpaid in full 6/12/08 \u2013 over the phone\u201d \nand \u201c[t]his payment made closes this account [and] the receipt is being mailed to me.\u201d6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d lists a delinquent credit card debt of $4,319. Applicant submitted a \ncredit report when she responded to DOHA interrogatories on September 28, 2007. She \nhand wrote next to the entry for this debt, \u201cCurrent arrangement is repay $50 per month \neff[ective] 10/07. They are sending billing info to me soon. Currently I do not have \ndocumentation.\u201d There is no evidence that Applicant made any payments on this debt. \nA collection company offered a settlement of this debt on April 19, 2008, listing three \nsettlement options. Applicant could settle the debt by paying a one-time settlement of \n$1,943 by May 9, 2008; two monthly payments of $1,079, with the first payment due by \nMay 9, 2008; or three monthly payments of $791, with the first payment due by May 9, \n2008. Applicant testified that she planned on taking the third option and would make the \nfirst payment the day after the hearing. She stated that she had the funds to make the \npayment as she had between $2,000 and $2,500 in her bank account. Applicant has not \nmade any payments on this account. In her post-hearing submission, she wrote \u201c[t]his \nback into negotiations as the settlement offer was over $1,000 that I could not afford at \none time.\u201d7 \n \n \nThe debt of $1,241, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, is to a collection company on behalf \nof a telephone company. The debt has been deleted from Applicant\u2019s credit report. She \nprovided no evidence of payment of this debt or that the debt was not her \nresponsibility.8 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f lists a delinquent debt of $384 to the same collection company and \ntelephone company as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The credit reports list two separate \naccount numbers. Applicant paid $96 on October 1, 2007, to bring the debt down to the \nlisted amount of $384. She made a payment of $96 in December 2007. She made an \nadditional payment of $96 between January and April 2008, as the credit report of April \n30, 2008, shows a balance due of $192. In her post-hearing submission, Applicant \nprovided documentation of a payment of $97 on May 5, 2008, and a payment of $98 on \nJune 13, 2008, as payment in full for the debt.9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager described her as a valued and respected employee, who is \nhonest and dependable. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s financial situation and believes she \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 43-46, 58; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3-5; AE I, J, Q. It appears Applicant confused \nthis debt with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, discussed below. \n \n7 Tr. at 46, 58-60, 63-64; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3-5; AE D, H, J, O. \n \n8 Tr. at 46-47; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3-5; AE J, V. \n \n9 Tr. at 46-47; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3-5; AE E, F, J, R, T, U, V. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nis determined to clean up her credit and pay any outstanding debts. The company \nsupports her. A senior noncommissioned officer in the National Guard wrote that \nApplicant has demonstrated loyalty, trust, and responsibility in conscientiously carrying \nout her duties.10 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n                                                          \n10 AE L, M. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay her \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n\n \n7 \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes most of the debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable. She raised her children without financial support from their father. She \nexperienced periods of unemployment. These are conditions that were largely beyond \nher control. Applicant enrolled in a credit service in December 2007. The company \nissued her a \u201ccredit kit\u201d which included brochures and compact disks on managing her \ncredit. She paid the company $409 and made several payments on her delinquent \ndebts. The payments to the credit service and her creditors are: \n \n \nOctober 1, 2007 \n \n \n$96 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \n \nDecember 2007 \n \n \n$97 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \n \nDecember 2007 \n \n \n$109.95 \n \nCredit Service \n \nJanuary 2008 \n \n \n$150  \n \nCredit Service \n \nFebruary 2008 \n \n \n$149  \n \nCredit Service \n \nJanuary-April 2008  \n \n$96 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \n \nMay 5, 2008  \n \n \n$97 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \n \nJune 5, 2008  \n \n \n$100  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \n \nJune 12, 2008 \n \n \n$125  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \n \nJune 13, 2008 \n \n \n$98 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \nTOTAL: \n \n \n \n \n$1,117.95 \n \n \nApplicant has made payments on her debts. The question remains whether the \npayments were sufficient to constitute a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to repay her overdue \ncreditors. Several factors continue to concern me, including the sporadic nature of the \npayments, and Applicant\u2019s failure to follow up on her stated intentions of addressing her \ndebts. She stated in March 2005, that she was making arrangements to bring the \naccount in SOR \u00b6 1.a up to date. There is no evidence she took any action on the \naccount for the next several years. She wrote when she responded to the SOR that she \nattempted to set up monthly payments on the debt. She testified she had an agreement \nto pay the credit union $100 per month and that her first $100 payment was due May \n19, 2008. She did not make that payment when due, but made one payment of $100 on \nJune 5, 2008. She wrote in September 2007, that she made arrangements to pay $50 \nper month on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, starting in October 2007. She made no payments. \nShe testified that she had between $2,000 and $2,500 in her bank account and she \nplanned on paying $791 to the creditor the next day. She did not make the payment. \nShe wrote that the settlement offer had increased to more than $1,000 and she could \nnot afford that much at one time. She made payments to three creditors after the \nhearing, totaling $323. Based upon all the evidence, I am unable to make an affirmative \nfinding that Applicant\u2019s payments are sufficient to constitute a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to repay \nher overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts. I also do not find that there are \n\n \n8 \n \nclear indications that her problem is being resolved or is under control or that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are partially applicable.  \n \nI accept Applicant\u2019s participation in the credit service as counseling for the \npurposes of mitigation and I find that AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nwas either paid before November 2006, or was transferred to a different creditor with a \nbalance of $943 as of November 2007. In either event, it is not currently delinquent. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is well regarded by her \ncurrent employer and by the personnel in the Air National Guard. I also considered her \nhonorable service in the United States Navy. She raised two children without the benefit \nof support from their father. They are now adults, but she also helped support her four-\nyear-old granddaughter. She had periods of unemployment, but she has worked for her \ncurrent employer for more than three years. She has paid some of her debts. The \nAppeal Board has noted that an applicant is not required to establish that she has paid \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant must demonstrate \nthat she has \u201cestablished a plan to resolve [her] financial problems and taken significant \nactions to implement that plan.\u201d11 Applicant has made some payments on her debts and \nenrolled in a credit service. This meets the minimum requirements to be considered a \nplan to address her delinquent debts. However her sporadic payments and failed follow-\nups do not amount to \u201csignificant actions to implement that plan.\u201d  \n \n                                                          \n11 ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). \n\n \n9 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.
