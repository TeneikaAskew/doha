In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, alleging multiple arrests for various offenses between April 2008 and November 2018. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, alleging purchase and use of marijuana with varying frequency from 2001 to about 2013 or 2014. He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b, alleging that he falsified his SCA on in February 2007 and February 2017 by deliberately failure to disclose his drug involvement.

Applicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in 2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014.

The Guideline H \nconcerns are mitigated, but the concerns under Guidelines J and E are not mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 2007, and \nhe received a security clearance. He submitted another SCA in February 2017, seeking \nto continue his clearance. On July 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines J, H, and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 4, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On January 30, 2020, Department Counsel \nrequested a hearing. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 20, 2020, \nand the case was assigned to me on March 12, 2020. On the same day, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor March 31, 2020. The hearing was cancelled on March 17, 2020, because of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. \nOn April 7, 2021, I notified Applicant by email that his hearing was tentatively \nrescheduled for April 29, 2021, by video teleconference. He telephonically requested a \nlater date, and on April 12, 2021, the hearing was rescheduled for May 12, 2021, by video \nteleconference. On May 11, 2021, the testing of Applicant\u2019s computer for compatibility \nwith the DOHA video teleconference system was completed, and a hearing notice was \nemailed to Applicant with the contact information for the video teleconference. I convened \nthe hearing on May 12, 2021, as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 13 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not present the \ntestimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on May 26, 2021. \nAt the hearing, I kept the record open until May 21, 2021, to enable Applicant to \nsubmit documentary evidence. In my decision on June 10, 2021, I concluded that he had \nnot submitted any documentary evidence. Applicant appealed my adverse decision, \ncontending that he had submitted evidence on May 20, 2021. He attached two character \nreference letters and pictures of employment awards to his appeal brief, in support of his \nassertion that he had timely submitted matters that I had not received. The Appeal Board \nremanded the case and directed me to reopen the record and provide Applicant an \nopportunity to submit additional evidence. \nIn accordance with the Appeal Board mandate, I reopened the record. I reviewed \nall email sent to me on May 20, 2021, and a found an email transmitting the evidence that \nApplicant had sent. The email had been overlooked because the sender of the email was \nidentified by a series of letters and numbers bearing no resemblance to Applicant\u2019s name. \nApplicant\u2019s email was discovered by opening all emails with attachments that had been \nreceived on May 20, 2021. On September 25, 2021, I notified Applicant that I would \nconsider the additional evidence that he had submitted on May 20, 2021, and I gave him \nuntil October 1, 2021, to submit any additional materials that he wanted me to consider. \nHe did not submit anything further. \nApplicant\u2019s email of May 20, 2021 is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) \nI.

I have \nadmitted Applicant\u2019s additional evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, \nalleging multiple arrests for various offenses between April 2008 and November 2018. He \ndenied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, alleging purchase and use of marijuana with varying \nfrequency from 2001 to about 2013 or 2014. He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a \nand 3.b, alleging that he falsified his SCA on in February 2007 and February 2017 by \ndeliberately failure to disclose his drug involvement. His admissions in his answer and at \nthe hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old vehicle refueler employed by a defense contractor since \nOctober 2005. He received a security clearance in May 2007. He has never married, but \nhe has lived with a cohabitant since October 2016. He and his cohabitant have a 16-\nmonth-old daughter. (Tr. 19.) In his post-hearing submission, he included a photograph \nof a document reflecting the christening of his daughter. (AX F.) \nApplicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in \n2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014. He stopped \nusing it because his employer started random drug testing, and he realized that it could \njeopardize his job. (Tr. 23.) In his first SCA in February 2007, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion whether he had used a drug or controlled substance within the past seven years. \n(GX 1 at 23.) He testified that he could not remember why he did not disclose his \nmarijuana use. (Tr. 28.) He also testified that there was no reason why he continued to \nuse marijuana until 2014, except stupidity. (Tr. 30.) \nApplicant was arrested in April 2008 and charged with brandishing a firearm. His \narrest occurred after he was involved in a bar fight, and one of the participants told police \nthat he had brandished a firearm. The police stopped him as he drove away from the \nscene of the fight. He testified that he has never owned a firearm. The police searched \nthe vehicle and did not find a firearm. He appeared in court and was found not guilty \nbecause the police were unable to find a firearm. (GX 4 at 3; Tr. 34-35.) \nApplicant was arrested in February 2009 and charged with possession of \nmarijuana. After the police stopped him for speeding, they found marijuana in the center \nconsole of his car. He appeared in court and adjudication was deferred. He was placed \non probation for one year, required to attend drug-education classes, and was subjected \nto random urinalysis. He successfully completed his probation and the charges were \ndismissed. (GX 4 at 3; GX 5.) He did not disclose this arrest in his February 2017 SCA. \nHe testified that he did not disclose his February 2017 arrest because he was told that \nhis arrest record would be expunged.

After Applicant completed a period \nof probation and drug classes, the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 12.) Applicant \ndid not disclose this arrest to his employer. He testified that he was unaware of any \nrequirement to disclose arrests to his employer. He testified that did not disclose this \narrest or his continued use of marijuana in his February 2017 SCA, because he was afraid \nthat it would jeopardize his clearance and his job. (Tr. 32-33, 39.) \nIn January 2011, Applicant was charged with reckless driving, having an open \ncontainer of alcohol in his car, and possession of marijuana. Applicant was with his \ncousin, and he told the police that the marijuana was his, because he did not want his \ncousin to get in trouble. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant was convicted of the open-container offense \nand reckless driving, but the marijuana charge was dismissed. (GX 13.) \n \nIn November 2013, Applicant was arrested for maliciously causing bodily injury to \nhis cohabitant. He testified that his cohabitant was driving home after they had been \ndrinking at a bar, they began arguing, his cohabitant began swerving, and he grabbed the \nsteering wheel to keep the car from striking a guardrail. The police officer who noticed the \nswerving stopped them, noticed a cut on the cohabitant\u2019s forehead, and concluded that \nApplicant had hit her in the face. Applicant spent a week in jail after his arrest. (Tr. 53-\n55.) The charge was later reduced to assault and battery. In February 2014, the court \nfound \u201cfacts sufficient to find guilt,\u201d but deferred adjudication for one year. The charge \nwas dismissed in February 2015. (GX 7.) \nApplicant submitted his second SCA in February 2017. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to a \nquestion whether, during the last seven years, he had illegally used any drugs or \ncontrolled substances. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether he had ever used \nor otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. (GX 2 at 26.) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in September 2018, he \ntold the investigator that he had never been charged with an offense related to alcohol or \ndrugs. When the investigator confronted him with evidence of his arrest record, which \nincluded drug offenses, he disclosed his marijuana use, beginning in his teenage years \nand ending in 2014. He told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use \nwhile holding a security clearance because it did not matter, since he had stopped using \nmarijuana. He also told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use because \nhe misread the question. (GX 3 at 12-13.) \nIn July 2018, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on his cohabitant. \nApplicant testified that he was driving home after work after a long work day and spending \nsome time after work at a friend\u2019s house. He fell asleep and hit the rear of an 18-wheel \ntruck. His cohabitant came to the scene and was taking him home when they began \narguing, because his cohabitant refused to take him to a hospital. Applicant became angry \nand cracked the windshield of their car by punching it with his fist. His cohabitant called \nthe police, who concluded that they had been fighting. (Tr. 57-63.)

(Tr. 50-51.) In September 8, 2018, he appeared in court \nand pleaded no contest. The judge found \u201cfacts sufficient to find guilt\u201d and deferred \nadjudication until September 2020. (GX 8.) Applicant completed his probation and the \ncharge was dismissed. (Tr. 63.) Applicant and his cohabitant stayed apart for about seven \nor eight months after his arrest. (Tr. 64.) He testified that most of their arguments arose \nfrom his cohabitant\u2019s desire that he stay at home instead of socializing with friends away \nfrom home and her practice of saying things that she knew would provoke him. He \ntestified that the arguments and physical violence stopped after their daughter was born. \n(Tr. 51-52.) \nIn November 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the \ninfluence (DUI). His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was 0.17. In the jurisdiction where he \nwas arrested, jail time is mandatory for a BAC at or above 0.15. In March 2019, Applicant \nwas convicted and sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 175 days suspended, and a $250 \nfine. He was placed on unsupervised probation for one year. His driver\u2019s license was \nrestricted for one year, and he was required to install an ignition interlock on his vehicle. \n(GX 10.) He served his jail sentence on weekends. (Tr. 66.) \nApplicant admitted that many of his arrests were related to alcohol, but he does \nnot believe he has an alcohol problem. He has reduced his drinking since the birth of his \ndaughter. He testified that he drinks mainly on weekends and limits himself to about two \ndrinks or two beers. (Tr. 67.) He has never been diagnosed with an alcohol-abuse \ndisorder or received treatment for it. \nA friend of Applicant who has known him for 12 years submitted a statement \ndescribing Applicant as \u201ca very respectful and honest gentleman\u201d and \u201cthe type of person \nthat will give you the shirt off his back.\u201d The friend does not indicate whether he is a \nsupervisor, co-worker, or a friend. The friend does not indicate whether he is familiar with \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record. (AX A.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother submitted a statement acknowledging that Applicant has done \nthings \u201cthat have not been pleasing to the way of his teaching,\u201d but stating that he is now \na family-oriented person who is striving to be a better person. His mother states that \nApplicant speaks often of his job and his love for it, and that he is proud of his 15 years \nof service with his employer. (AX B.) Applicant submitted two photographs of a clock and \na montage of photographs containing the numeral 15, which he received in recognition of \n15 years of service.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence presented at the hearing establish \nthe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 31(b): \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible \nallegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n7 \n\n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are not established.

The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. Applicant has acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement. It is not clear whether he has disassociated from his drug-using associates, \nand he has not provided the signed statement of intent. However, he has abstained from \nmarijuana since 2014. \n \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) (happened so long ago) focuses on whether the drug \ninvolvement was recent. There are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is \nrecent. The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the \nevidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any \nevidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period \nof time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). Applicant\u2019s \nabstinence from marijuana has been for a \u201csignificant period of time,\u201d motivated by the \nrealization that marijuana use can jeopardize his security clearance and his job. I \nconclude that the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s drug involvement have been \nmitigated by the passage of time. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his 2007 and 2017 SCAs by his deliberate \nfailure to disclose his marijuana involvement. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b). The security concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish that \nhe did not fully disclose his marijuana use in either of his two SCAs, raising the following \ndisqualifying condition: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not disclose his marijuana involvement \nuntil a security investigator confronted him with evidence of marijuana involvement during \na security interview in September 2018. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant falsified two SCAs, including his most \nrecent, on which this adjudication is based. Falsification of an SCA is not \u201cminor\u201d because \nit \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. \nBd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. I have considered that Applicant has worked for a \ndefense contractor since October 2005 and held a security clearance since May 2007. \nThe birth of Applicant\u2019s daughter apparently was a significant event for him, and it has \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused him to reconsider his previous lifestyle, but I am not convinced that the volatile \nrelationship between him and his cohabitant will not resurface. Nor am I convinced that \nsufficient time has passed to ensure that he will not revert to his previous irresponsible \nbehavior once the excitement over the birth of his daughter wears off and the pressures \nof rearing a child set in. I noted his candor and sincerity at the hearing, but it is offset by \nhis years of deception during the security-clearance process. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J, H, and E, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his drug involvement, but he has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his criminal conduct and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1-b-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drugs): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 3, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign \ninfluence) and F (financial considerations). Applicant responded to the SOR on \nDecember 17, 2019, and April 30, 2020, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic and \nApplicant was working overseas. The case was assigned to another administrative \njudge on January 27, 2021, and reassigned to me on May 25, 2021. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on June 11, 2021. Applicant participated from Iraq. \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through S, which \n1 \n\nwere admitted without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He submitted documents that were marked AE S \nthrough U.

(Tr. at 18-20, 39; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE A, H-L) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ncase in 1997, and his debts were discharged the same year. He filed a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy case in 2002. The case was dismissed in 2003. Applicant lost his home to \nforeclosure in 2007. Applicant stated that the bankruptcies resulted from back injuries \nand extended time off from work. He asserted that his wife at the time did not make their \nmortgage payments while he was working overseas as a linguist. (Tr. at 36-38; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 8, 9; AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s family in Iraq and financial issues were the basis of a 2009 SOR and \nhearing. He received a favorable decision by the Administrative Judge in February \n2010, who concluded that foreign influence and financial considerations security \nconcerns were mitigated. \n2 \n\nApplicant had additional financial problems within a few years of the favorable \ndecision. The SOR alleges the two bankruptcy cases and seven delinquent debts \ntotaling about $17,080. The debts are established by credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. The credit reports indicate that the debts became delinquent between 2012 \nand March 2014. Applicant again attributed his financial problems to his second wife, \nwho did not pay their debts while he was working overseas. (Tr. at 22; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 4-7) \nApplicant has settled and paid all of the SOR debts. The $5,002 and $2,379 \ndebts to the same credit card company (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e) were settled through \npayments in 2018 for one account and payments from 2019 to 2020 for the other \naccount. The creditor issued an IRS Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) in August 2020 \ncancelling $3,752, which is the difference between the amount that was owed the \ncreditor and what the creditor received from Applicant in settlement of the debt.

(AE U) He \nsettled the $2,600 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d for an undisclosed amount in November \n2019 (AE E). He settled the $1,016 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $609, which he \ncompleted through payments in September and October 2019. (AE C, T) He paid $280 \nin October 2019 to resolve the $455 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. (AE V) \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are sound. He has not accrued any new delinquent \ndebts since 2014. He has not remarried. He handles his own finances now. He stated \nthat online access and payments to accounts are easier than they used to be, and he \ndoes not have to rely on a stateside spouse to pay his bills while he is working \noverseas. (Tr. at 46-47; GE 7; AE P) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n3 \n\nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n4 \n\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s sister is a citizen and resident of Iraq. The potential for terrorist \nviolence against U.S. interests and citizens remains high in Iraq, and it continues to \nhave human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s connection to his sister creates a potential \nconflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq \ncould not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. The \nAppeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of limited value, \nunless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar manner in the \npast in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous track record of \ncomplying with security regulations and procedures in the context of dangerous, high-\n5 \n\nrisk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the national security. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-\n03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \nI find that Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n6 \n\nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including bankruptcy cases and \ndelinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe most recent bankruptcy case was dismissed more than 18 years ago. The \nprevious Administrative Judge determined in 2010 that Applicant\u2019s financial problems, \nwhich included the bankruptcy cases, were mitigated. I also find them to be mitigated. \nThey are relevant primarily to show whether Applicant learned from the experiences. He \ndid not learn enough because he had additional financial problems within a few years of \nthe 2010 decision. \nApplicant started settling and paying the SOR debts in 2018, before the SOR \nwas issued. All of the SOR debts are resolved, and Applicant\u2019s current finances are \nsound. He has not accrued any new delinquent debts since 2014. He is divorced and \nhandling his own finances. \nI find that Applicant made a good-faith effort to pay his delinquent debts. His \nfinancial problems are resolved and are under control. They occurred under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s work overseas in support of the U.S. military. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence and financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Security concerns are mitigated. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 28, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudication Facility (CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. On May \n11, 2020, he answered the SOR and requested a hearing before a Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) judge. I was assigned the case on June 26, 2020. \nDelayed due to the global pandemic of 2020, a notice of hearing was ultimately \nscheduled on September 11, 2020, setting the hearing for October 8, 2020. The hearing \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas convened as scheduled. The Government offered five exhibits (Exs.), noted as \nExs. 1-4 and 6, and two hearing exhibits (HE), marked as HE 1-2. (Transcript (Tr.) at 7-\n8; 12-13) These documents were accepted into the record without objection. Applicant \nprovided testimony and offered seven documents, accepted as Exs. B-E and G-I. A \ndocument pre-marked as Ex. A was not submitted after the hearing. (Tr. 15) No Ex. F \nwas offered.  \nApplicant was granted through October 29, 2020, to submit any additional \nmaterials. On October 19, 2020, the previously identified transcript of the proceeding \n(Tr.) was received and five additional exhibits from Applicant were accepted into the \nrecord without objection (Exs. J-N). With no additional materials or commentary \nreceived, the record was closed on November 5, 2020. Based on the testimony, \nmaterials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant mitigated financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 49-year-old security officer. He has served in that capacity with the \nsame government contractor for 24 years. He has maintained a security clearance \nwithout adverse incident for over two decades. He also works a part-time position with \nanother entity. (Tr. 25) Combined, Applicant is employed for at least 70 hours a week. \n(Tr. 25) In addition, he has worked multiple hours as part of a five-year apprenticeship \nwithin the field of investigative services. (Tr. 26) Income from this apprenticeship, which \nappears to make him a self-employed independent contractor under the auspices of a \ntrainer or mentor, has been minimal. (Tr. 28, 49-51) He is personally unsure of how \nsuch work qualifies in terms of income and taxes. \nIn sum, Applicant has generated a gross annual income of approximately \n$140,000. (Tr. 33) His wife earns between about $80,000 and $90,000 a year. (Tr. 34) \nThis is a notable increase since 2015, when the couple had a joint income of about \n$152,000. (Tr. 48) They presently maintain their finances separately. (Tr. 34) \nIn terms of education, Applicant attended high school and has received financial \ncounseling from a recognized entity. (Tr. 21) Consequently, he maintains a household \nbudget. (Tr. 21) Applicant employs others to prepare his taxes. He is married and has \ntwo children, ages 23 and 13. The eldest child recently relocated to a distant state, \nwhere she plans to continue her education. Until the recent pandemic, Applicant\u2019s in-\nlaws lived with the family; they have since returned to their home country. Applicant is \npresently selling his house of 14 years with plans to move to another area. \nBy 2017, Applicant had acquired some commercial debt, represented in SOR \nallegations 1.a-1.d., amounting to almost $48,000. He appears to mainly attribute this to \npoor tax advice and tax return preparation, related tax issues, and house repairs. \nFeeling overwhelmed in about September 2017, Applicant sought the advice and \nguidance of a debt relief program. He then enrolled in that program, which negotiated \nsettlements and made payments toward those debts. (Tr. 77-79, 82) He eventually left \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat program in favor of a debt consolidation entity. (Tr. 97; see also Tr. 120-121) \nUltimately, those debts were satisfied. (See Exs. A-D; Tr. 15-16, 82-83, 88, 92-94) \nAt issue in the SOR at allegations 1.e-1.h are Federal tax delinquencies for tax \nyear (TY) 2015 ($16,505), TY 2016 ($16,105), TY 2017 ($16,151), and TY 2018 \n($2,831), respectively, cumulatively amounting to about $55,300. Applicant\u2019s tax records \nare incomplete. His knowledge of his tax situation is somewhat limited because he had \nothers prepare his tax returns. However, his documents showed that he has been \nmaking progress on his TY 2015 tax debt through an instalment agreement since 2018, \nand reflected that he has made initial payments toward the debts owed for TY 2016-\n2018. (Ex. E) He is unsure if he has yet completed all payments toward TY 2015, but \nnoted that he started regular instalment payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \ntoward TY 2016 in September 28, 2020. (Tr. 18) He concedes regular payments toward \nTY 2017-2018 have not yet commenced, but will move on to the next year at issue on \ncompletion of the payments for TY 2016. (Tr. 19) \nFinally, Applicant owed his home state of residence delinquent taxes amounting \nto about $2,831 for TYs 2015-2016. This came about due to adjustments to his Federal \ntax obligation for that time period. In 2019, he satisfied the combined state tax \nobligation. (Tr. 19, 74; Ex. G) At present, he is up-to-date with all state taxes, consumer \ncredit accounts, and personal loans. (Tr. 75, 114) His only outstanding delinquent debts \nare related to his Federal taxes, as noted above. (Tr. 103) \nAt present, Applicant\u2019s checking account has a balance of about $4,000. (Tr. 34) \nA joint 401(k) account has a balance of about $140,000. Applicant is timely on the \n$200,000 balance owed on his mortgage. His payments on the family automobiles are \ntimely. (Tr. 109) Those payments, amounting to about $12,000 a year, conclude in late \n2020 with the satisfaction of the underlying loans. (Tr. 36) Applicant was having a \nmonthly net remainder of about $1,000. (Tr. 36) Now that pre-sales home repairs are \ncomplete, he anticipates a monthly net remainder of at least $3,000. (Tr. 37) Additional \nmoney will be available when the car payments cease. Applicant now employs \nprofessionals to prepare his tax returns. He and his wife do not lead extravagant lives. \nApplicant\u2019s last vacation was in the Caribbean over three years ago. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person. This includes information that is both \nfavorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions include \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nsafeguard such information, shall be in terms of the national interest, and do not \nquestion the loyalty of an applicant. \nAnalysis \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhas acquired multiple delinquent debts, both consumer and tax-related. This is sufficient \nto raise financial considerations disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance-related security concerns posed here: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control, and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debt. \nThe obligations at issue are multiple in number. Some are still existent and none \nwere the result of unusual circumstances, thus obviating AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant \nattributed his accumulation of debt to tax issues and home repairs. He acknowledged \nthat he did not perform his own tax work, and he did not specify if these repairs were \nordinary, essential, cosmetic, or emergency. There is no indication that the obligations \ncame about due to conditions beyond his control. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant has received financial counseling from an established entity and now \nmaintains a budget. He satisfied both his commercial obligations and state tax debt, and \nstarted addressing his Federal tax balances. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(c) - AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. Consideration must be made of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). I am also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the determination \nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be a commonsense judgment \nbased on consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is a 49-year-old security officer with a high school education. He has \nserved in that capacity for 24 years and has successfully maintained a security \nclearance for over two decades. He supplements his income with a second job and is \ntraining for a new profession.

Their net monthly will increase significantly by the end of 2020. \nIn addition to receiving financial counseling, Applicant maintains a budget. He \nhas professionals prepare his taxes. He is married and has two children, ages 23 and \n13, and the oldest child recently moved out of the family residence. He no longer \nprovides a home for his in-laws. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was direct and credible. He takes full responsibility for his \nacquisition of delinquent debt. He is committed to honoring his obligations. He has \nmade progress in the past using a budget and his past level of income. Today, he \ncommands an increased net monthly income of at least $3,000 due to the departure of \nthree family members and the elimination of house repairs. This increase is expected to \nsoon grow further on cessation of his car payments. Combined, he should have more \nthan sufficient funds to responsibly eliminate his remaining delinquent debts in an \nexpedited manner. \nThe record shows that Applicant has started efforts to eliminate all of his \ndelinquent debt, and he has thus far successfully addressed both his state tax and all \ncommercial debts at issue. He presented evidence showing he has started addressing \nat least the first two of the four years of Federal tax debts at issue, starting with the \noldest and moving forward. With the financial resources to continue addressing these \nfinal accounts, and given his resolve to honor his delinquent debts, I do not foresee any \nfurther delay satisfying his remaining tax obligations. I find Applicant mitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nArthur E.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 61 years old. He married for the third time in 2001. He and his wife \nshare seven children ranging in ages from 39 to 18 years old. His wife is the president of \na company and vice president of another company. Applicant has worked for his current \nemployer, a federal contractor, since 2005. He is also self-employed part-time on the side \nas the owner of his own company. (Tr. 115-119; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant and his wife purchased a house in 2001. Between 2005 and 2011, they \nexperienced family emergencies that impacted their finances. This included caring for \nparents and children\u2019s health issues. In 2015, they experienced another health issue with \none of the children that affected their finances. (Tr. 119, 181-183, 200) \nApplicant and his wife acquired a $40,000 home equity loan in 2008 that was used \nfor home improvements and to pay credit card debts. Due to other unexpected family \nemergencies they began having difficulties making their mortgage payments in the later \npart of 2008. In 2013, they applied for mortgage relief to have the mortgage\u2019s interest rate \ndecreased. Although it was decreased, it was not as helpful as they had anticipated, and \nthey fell behind in their mortgage payments. They retained an attorney to help them \nnegotiate a better term and prevent foreclosure. The attorney was unsuccessful. (Tr. 121-\n137, 183-186; AE A, B, C, D, E, F) \nApplicant retained another attorney. The process of dealing with the mortgage \ncompany was long and cumbersome. Despite attempting to obtain a modification, the \nattorney eventually negotiated a \u201ccash for keys\u201d resolution. Applicant received $4,500 in \ncash, and the mortgage company received the property and agreed to waive the \ndeficiency balance, so there was no further financial obligation. The deficiency balance \nat the time was $272,794. In Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s affidavit, she stated that they lived in the \nhouse until 2019 when the transaction was finalized. Applicant admitted, to the best of his \nrecollection, that for approximately three years, while he was seeking a mortgage loan \nmodification, he did not pay the mortgage or the homeowner\u2019s fees, essentially living in \nthe home rent-free.

(Tr. 121-137, 186-190; GE 5, 6, 7; AE A, B, C, D, \nE, F, G, H, I, J) \nApplicant testified that beginning in 2001, after he and his wife married, she was \nresponsible for filing their federal income tax returns because she was a successful \nbusinessperson who analyzed contracts and was experienced in finances. He said she \nfiled their tax returns from 2001 through 2012, and there were no issues. He stated that \nhe never inquired about whether their tax returns were timely filed. (Tr. 138-140) \nApplicant\u2019s wife provided an affidavit. She stated that after they married she \nassumed the responsibility to file their federal income tax returns because of her business \nbackground. Applicant provided financial information to his wife. In her affidavit she said \nthat Applicant would inquire \u201chow it was going and if I needed anything.\u201d (Tr. 138-139; AE \nA) She further stated in her affidavit: \nFrom 2001 to 2012, I prepared written returns that [I] filed with the IRS in \npaper form. The IRS received these returns. I started using Turbo Tax to \nprepare and file our returns beginning in 2013. \nI recall preparing and timely filing our 2013-2018 tax returns using Turbo \nTax. The IRS received our 2014 return, but they apparently did not receive \nour 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 returns. I am not certain as to the \ncause of the problem. I assumed that they were filed and received by the \nIRS until the IRS advised us that information in their possession indicated \nwe owed taxes for 2013. I am not certain when we received this notice. \n[Applicant] hired an accountant who helped us get the 2013 return in the \nhands of the IRS. I am a bit fuzzy on the actual dates when this occurred. \nI also prepared and e-filed our return for 2014, which the IRS received. I did \nthe same for tax years 2015-2018, but as we found out sometime later, the \nIRS said it had not received them. \nEach year when [Applicant] would ask me if the returns had been filed, I told \n[him] they had as I was sure that I had filed them properly. I did mention to \n[Applicant] from time to time that my business partnerships had complicated \nour returns, but that I still felt comfortable preparing them. (AE A) \nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) in June 2017. In it \nhe disclosed that he failed to pay 2013 federal income taxes. He disclosed he was \ndisputing the amount that the IRS claimed he owed and that he had hired an accountant, \nMr. B, to determine the accurate amount before he began making payments. He noted \nthat his wife\u2019s partnerships made it complicated to calculate the amount actually owed. At \nthat time, he estimated they owed approximately $25,000. He disclosed that his 2016 \nfederal tax return had not yet been filed, and Mr. B had filed an extension. (Extensions \npast the April 15th  filing date are due on October 15th.) He estimated he owed $150,000 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin unpaid income taxes. Applicant also noted in his SCA that he was attempting to \nrefinance his home in lieu of foreclosure at that time. (Tr. 160-163; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s 2013 federal income tax transcript reflects there was an extension \ngranted for filing the return, but the IRS did not receive the return until December 2014, \nwhich was late. However, the return was received, apparently through Turbo Tax, as \nApplicant\u2019s wife stated. Because it was filed late, penalties and interest were imposed. \nOriginally Applicant received a refund for 2013. In May 2016, an additional amount of \n$29,983 tax was accessed due to unreported income, along with penalties and interest. \nA notice to Applicant was issued in April 2016 about the additional assessment. The 2013 \ntax transcript shows Applicant had appointed a representative, Mr. B, in May 2016. A \nsecond notice was sent in July 2017 and again in November 2018. (Tr. 36-40, 87-93, 102-\n104, 141, 146-149; AE K) \nIn March 2019, an installment agreement was established and Applicant made \nsequential monthly payments of $500 for seven months, one monthly payment of $750, \nand one monthly payment of $1,000 in February 2020. He failed to make another payment \nuntil July 2020, which was $1,500. Applicant was making these payments to a collection \nagency after the debt was transferred by the IRS. Applicant testified that he stopped \nmaking payments on the advice of Mr. B because Mr. B was getting ready to file \ndelinquent returns and it would automatically trigger the stop. He would then have a \nrepresentative negotiate a payment plan with the IRS based on the total amount owed. \nThe plan was terminated in December 2020. The tax transcript showed an account \nbalance of $28,608. It also showed that in March of 2016, the IRS noted there was \nunreported income for this tax year. (Tr. 36-40, 87-93, 102-104, 141, 146-149; AE K) \nApplicant hired a tax expert accountant, Mr. H, in January 2021. Mr. H testified on \nbehalf of Applicant. He explained that one of the reasons an IRS installment agreement \nmight be terminated is when there is a new tax liability for a subsequent year or if a \npayment is missed. He stated that tax notices are sent by mail and addressed to the last \nknown address of record. In Applicant\u2019s case, the notice would have been sent to where \nhe lived in 2014. The same address he was at until he moved sometime in 2019 after he \naccepted a settlement with the mortgage company. The last notice of November 2018 \nindicated the debt was transferred to a private debt collector. (Tr. 19-22, 40-43; AE K) \nMr. H also explained that tax transcripts show a received date and a processing \ndate. The received date is what determines whether the return was late. The processing \ndate is the date that the return is considered filed. A request for an extension to file a tax \nreturn must be submitted by a form and the IRS acknowledges it in the transcript. (Tr. 43-\n44 \nApplicant\u2019s 2014 tax transcript indicates that a federal income tax return was \nreceived in April 2015 and was timely. Tax year 2014 was the only year from 2013 through \n2018 that an extension to file was not requested. Applicant received a $6,737 refund. His \n2015 tax transcript indicates Applicant filed for an extension for tax year 2015. It further \nindicated that his 2015 federal income tax return was received in June 2020.

Applicant\u2019s tax liability for 2015 \nwas $31,183. As of June 2021, that liability has increased with penalties and interest to \n$55,130. Applicant stated in his June 2019 answers to government interrogatories that \nthe reason his 2015 tax returns were not filed was because his wife thought she mailed \nit. He testified that this is what his wife told him. This contradicts what she stated in her \naffidavit that the return was filed through Turbo Tax. (Tr. 31-33, 45-52, 96-98, 171-173; \nGE 3; AE K) \nApplicant\u2019s 2016 tax transcript indicates that in April 2017 he filed for an extension \nto file his tax return. The IRS received his 2016 tax return in June 2020. He failed to timely \nfile the return. He owed approximately $13,269 at the time, but with penalties and interest, \nas of June 2021, he owed $22,988 for tax year 2016. (Tr. 52-53, 98; AE K) \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 tax transcript indicates that in April 2018 he filed for an extension \nto file his tax return. The IRS received his 2017 tax return in June 2020. He failed to timely \nfile the return. He owed approximately $7,993 with penalties and interest. The tax \ntranscript notes that in July 2019, the IRS issued a notice that told Applicant to file his \npersonal tax return immediately. Further it noted that in August 2019, Applicant had given \na power of attorney to a representative to act on his behalf. This person was Mr. B. It is \nunknown why if Applicant had been working with Mr. B since completing his June 2017 \nSCA, his tax returns for 2017 and 2018 were not timely filed. Applicant said he was \nunaware until approximately late 2018 or 2019 that he had years of unfiled tax returns. \nApplicant testified that Mr. B asked Applicant\u2019s wife for proof that she had filed the \ndelinquent returns, and she could not find copies for any of the years in question. Mr. B \nfiled Applicant\u2019s 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax returns in June 2020. (Tr. 53-55, 86-87, \n165-169, 194; AE K \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 tax transcript indicates that in April 2019 he filed for an extension \nto file his tax return. The IRS received his 2018 tax return in June 2020. He failed to timely \nfile the return. The tax transcript shows that he owed $6,036 taxes and with penalties and \ninterest the balance was $8,378, which he paid in January 2021. (Tr. 55-56; AE K) \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 federal income tax return was received by the IRS in October \n2020. It was timely filed due to the government extending the due date because of the \npandemic. The tax owed was $7,555, and it was paid in January 2021. Mr. H prepared \nApplicant\u2019s 2020 federal income tax return and it was timely filed. Applicant owed $8,438, \nwhich included a small late penalty for not prepaying the taxes. It is paid. (Tr. 144-146; \nTr. 56-60; AE K) \nMr. H testified that the total tax debt Applicant owed was approximately $115,198 \nas of June 2021. In June 2021, Mr. H started the process of negotiating a payment plan \nwith the IRS. In anticipation of the payment plan, Applicant made payments of $1,600 in \nMay and June 2021 to be applied to the 2017 tax debt.

Applicant testified he can afford this amount of the payment. Mr. \nH testified that the IRS indicated that a tax lien would be filed once the payment plan \ncommenced because of the amount owed. The lien would cover all assets Applicant and \nhis wife own. Mr. H explained that basically the IRS owns the equity in anything Applicant \nand his wife own. Applicant also provided documents to show he paid his federal taxes \nowed for tax year 2020, and he made two estimated tax payments for tax year 2021. (Tr. \n60-72, 93-96, 107-109, 149-157; AE M, N, O, P, Q, S, T1, T2, U) \nMr. H testified that he uses a professional grade tax filing software. He stated that \nhe has not used Turbo Tax in the past ten years. He was previously aware that Turbo \nTax will acknowledge a return is submitted and by email will indicate the IRS received the \nreturn. He stated that he is aware that if tax is owed and not paid, the IRS will send notices \nusually within 30 days after the return is filed. In response to Department Counsel\u2019s \nquestion, Mr. H stated that he would not be surprised to learn that Turbo Tax keeps copies \nof tax filings made by taxpayers. Neither Applicant, his wife, Mr. B nor Mr. H requested \ncopies of Applicant\u2019s 2013 through 2018 Turbo Tax returns. After being hired, Mr. H used \nApplicant\u2019s official IRS tax transcripts and whatever information Applicant provided to \naddress Applicant\u2019s tax problems. Applicant did not provide copies of tax returns his wife \nsaid were filed for the years in question. The IRS recommends maintaining copies of \nfederal tax returns for three years. Mr. H recommends maintaining copies for seven years. \n(Tr. 25-31, 74-85, 99, 196-197) \nApplicant owes taxes for tax years 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Applicant testified \nthat his wife never told him they owed taxes for those years. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s affidavit \ndid not explain why, if she timely filed the federal tax returns as she stated, she and \nApplicant failed to pay the taxes when due as required. The tax transcripts do not support \nany payments were made. No documents were offered by Applicant to show he or his \nwife paid the taxes when they were due. Proof of payment would provide some \ncorroboration that the tax returns were filed. (Tr. 201) I did not find Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \naffidavit credible. \nApplicant provided a character letter from his supervisor. She described him as \ndependable, level-headed, and trustworthy. He complies with procedures and policies \nwith regard to ethical business practices, information technology, and program security. \nHe is respected by his peers, management and customers. (Tr. 157; AE R) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage was past due for failing to make his required payments. \nApplicant failed to file, as required, federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2015, \n2016, 2017, and 2018. He owes delinquent federal taxes of approximately $115,000. \nThere is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s tax liability for 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017, is more than $115,000. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s testimony and his wife\u2019s affidavit, she filed on time, but somehow \nthe returns were not received or accepted electronically. The only return that was \naccepted was in 2014 when they received a refund. She also indicated she kept her \nhusband apprised about her complying with filing their tax returns. Neither Applicant nor \nhis wife indicated that when she told him that she had filed timely, she also told him that \nthey owed $31,183 for tax year 2015, $13,269 for tax year 2016, and $7,993 for tax year \n2017. The evidence shows they were going through financial difficulties during these \nyears as they were attempting to prevent their house from foreclosure. Based on all of \nthe evidence, I did not find Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s vague and incomplete explanations credible. \nRegardless of whether Applicant was aware of the extent of their tax problems, he is \nequally responsible for ensuring his tax returns are filed on time and the taxes paid. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s large tax debt for multiple tax years \nhas only recently been enrolled in an installment plan with the IRS. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems were impacted by family emergencies and medical issues that were beyond his \ncontrol. These impacted his ability to pay his mortgage. They did not impact his ability to \ntimely file his federal income tax returns and make payment arrangements with the IRS \neach year if he was unable to pay the tax at the time. Applicant did not act responsibly at \nthe time. Although Applicant said his wife was completely responsible for their tax failures, \nhe had an obligation to ensure the tax returns were filed and taxes were paid. It is not \nbelievable that he never inquired whether they were to receive a refund or owe taxes \neach year considering they were going through serious financial issues regarding their \nability to pay their mortgage. The fact that he says he was unaware of what was \nhappening does not absolve him of his legal duties. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. \nApplicant sought help from two accountants to resolve his tax issues and there are \nindications the problem is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant has made \npayments toward his tax debt prior to having an installment agreement. He now has an \nagreement with the IRS to make monthly payments towards his tax debt. AG \u00b6 20(d) has \nsome application and AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is responsible for ensuring his federal income taxes are timely filed and \npaid. He was going through financial problems at the same time and attempting to save \nhis house from foreclosure. I considered the IRS transcripts to be most probative. His \nwife\u2019s affidavit was vague with details and failed to explain many important facts. I did not \nfind it credible. Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax returns are now filed and his installment \nagreement with the IRS has been approved. Applicant still owes a substantial debt and \nhe has not yet established a financial track record of compliance. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 1 \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to timely \nfile and pay his federal income taxes raises serious concerns. Although there is some \nevidence of mitigation, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n1 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd.

On October 2, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The \nDOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 21, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA).

SOR \u00b6 1.a reads, \u201cYou used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nMarch 2013 to about July 2017, while granted access to classified information.\u201d \nApplicant offered no clarification or additional explanation when he admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nIn denying SOR \u00b6 1.b, regarding his future intentions, he also made no further \ncomment. \nThe basis of both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b is set forth in Applicant\u2019s December 2017 \nSCA and in the summaries of his background interviews of December 2017 and \nJanuary 2018, both of which he authenticated, with some corrections, in an August \n2019 interrogatory response.

I put down the \ndope even though it was more than 7 years ago because I was asked this \nquestion before, when I was asked why I did not put that down I replied it \nwas more than 7 years ago. (GE 1 at 26) \nWhen asked to provide the type of drug or controlled substance used, Applicant \nlisted: \nTHC (Such as marijuana, weed, pot, hashish, etc.) Also codeine, \nMorphine and Vicodin when I was in a sickle cell crisis. For medical \nreasons. The pot was about a year ago and I had a SC [sickle cell] crisis \nlast year also. The experiment with dope was more than 7 years ago but [I \nam] being honest in case it comes up.\u201d (GE 1 at 26) \nApplicant listed a month of first use as \u201c03/2013 (Estimated)\u201d and most recent \nuse as \u201c11/2016 (Estimated).\u201d He then stated, \u201cI used the pot on my birthday and at a \ncookout, other drugs when I was sick.\u201d (GE 1 at 26) Applicant\u2019s birthday is in November. \n(GE 1 at 5)  \nApplicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question, \u201cWas your use while possessing a \nsecurity clearance?\u201d As to the question, \u201cDo you intend to use this drug or controlled \nsubstance in the future?,\u201d he answered \u201cYes,\u201d and explained: \nI answered yes because of my sickle cell but I am trying other drugs \nprescribed by my Dr. to try and not to. For now this seems like the only \nthing that helps SC. [I] don\u2019t have crises all the time, maybe once or twice \na year.\u201d (GE 1 at 26) \nApplicant discussed his history of illegal drug use during his first background \ninterview, in December 2017. He said he first used THC when he was 17. (GE 1 at 26; \nTr. 45) He said he believed he started using it again in March 2013. Then he said words \nto the effect of: \nWithin the last 7 years, [Applicant] has used 4-6 times. [Applicant] does \nnot purchase THC and only uses when it is available and offered to him. \n[Applicant] last used in 7/17 with his cousin, while possessing a security \nclearance. [Applicant] has used with ex-girlfriends, and friends at \ncookouts, fishing trips, and people\u2019s houses. . . . [Applicant] uses THC \nmedically for his sickle cell anemia.

(GE 2 at 10) \nApplicant also stated words to the effect of, \u201c[w]ith regard to future intentions, [he] \ndoes not intend to seek out THC but if he it [sic] is offered to him, he does not plan to \nturn it down.\u201d (GE 2 at 10) Applicant acknowledged that he had used THC with a \nclearance. Applicant also acknowledged in his interview that he used heroin about 20 \nyears ago. He relapsed about 15 years ago (in about 2005) and went to treatment. (GE \n2 at 11) \nIn his second interview, in January 2018, Applicant clarified the details of his prior \ndrug use. He said he never used THC medically, only socially. He also clarified that his \nuse of codeine, morphine, and Vicodin was not illegal, as he was given those drugs \nintravenously in hospitals. (GE 2 at 16; Tr. 41) \nWith respect to his use of THC, Applicant clarified that he put March 2013 as his \nstart date on his SCA because \u201cprior to 3/13, his use was much less frequent.\u201d GE 2 at \n16 (emphasis added) Since March 2013, Applicant \u201chas used THC approximately 4-6 \ntimes. [Applicant] most recently used THC in 7/17.\u201d (GE 2 at 16) Applicant stated in his \ninterview that he \u201cis aware that the use of THC is illegal and that usage could jeopardize \nhis clearance. [Applicant] does not use THC regularly and has no intentions [of] seeking \nout the drug to use it.\u201d (GE 2 at 16) Applicant also addressed his prior use of heroin, \nmost recently in 2005. (GE 2 at 16) \nApplicant was given the opportunity to review, edit, and correct the OPM agent\u2019s \nsummaries of his two interviews in an interrogatory response that he returned to DOHA \nin August 2019. (GE 2) In reviewing the interview summaries, Applicant corrected the \nstatus of certain financial matters, his father\u2019s citizenship, and the name or location of \nhis high school. Applicant did not make any corrections to the portions of the interview \nsummaries concerning his THC use. (GE 2 at 2-3; Tr. 55)  \nIn a separate section, the DOHA interrogatory also asked about Applicant\u2019s drug \nuse. To a question asking \u201cHave you engaged in any additional drug use since July \n2017?,\u201d he answered \u201cNo\u201d and wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201d To a question asking \u201cHave you \nEVER used ANY illegal drug in addition to marijuana?,\u201d (emphasis in original) he \nanswered, \u201cYes\u201d and reported his prior heroin use, noting that he had previously \nindicated the dates to the best of his knowledge. (GE 2 at 4) \nApplicant began his hearing testimony by acknowledging that he had made a \nmistake. He asserted that he is an honest person. He has worked for his employer for \n21 years and does not get into trouble. (Tr. 25-26, 31) \nApplicant denied using any marijuana between 2006 and 2013. (Tr. 46) He \nrepeatedly asserted during his testimony that during the timeframe in question (March \n2013 to July 2017, as alleged), he had used marijuana twice. Once was on a fishing trip, \nin 2013, and once was at a cousin\u2019s wedding in another state, in 2016 or 2017.

(Tr. 42, 43) \nWhen confronted at his hearing about what he reported on his SCA about his \nprior drug use (\u201cI used the pot on my birthday and at a cookout. . . \u201d), Applicant testified, \n\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d (Tr. 52) When pressed further about whether he might have used \nmarijuana at least four times (the birthday, the cookout, the fishing trip and the \nwedding), Applicant acknowledged, \u201cI think that that\u2019s accurate.\u201d (Tr. 53) \nApplicant testified that \u201cI can\u2019t hardly remember what happened, you know, last \nyear, last month.\u201d (Tr. 53) He asserted several times more that he had a poor memory \nfor dates and other specifics. (Tr. 55, 56, 57) \nWith respect to the timing of his most recent use, Applicant denied using \nmarijuana or THC since filling out his SCA in February 2017. (Tr. 57) He said his \ninterview statements that he used marijuana as recently as July 2017 were not \naccurate. (Tr. 57) He later said, \u201cAnd, like I said, it could have been before that . . . \n.\u201d)(Tr. 67) \n \nApplicant denied any prior use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.

Some of this is attributable to his \npersonal habits; he said he is a \u201cworkaholic\u201d and has no real hobbies. He acknowledged \nthat some of this is also due to the ongoing pandemic, which limits everyone\u2019s interest \nand ability to socialize with others. (Tr. 43-44, 47, 68) \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing materials included a letter in which he expressed \n\u201csincere remorse for my irresponsible actions.\u201d He offered \u201cno excuse\u201d and accepted \n\u201cfull responsibility.\u201d He further stated, \u201cI know for a fact I will never take illegal \nsubstances, for I don\u2019t associate with those people who provided it anymore.\u201d (AE A) \nApplicant also provided four recommendation letters from professional \nreferences.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant has held a security clearance for most of the last 20 years. He \nacknowledged using marijuana on at least two occasions since 2013, and most likely \nused a few times more than that, on social occasions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(f) both apply \nto Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana or THC, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s older drug \nuse, including heroin, is not alleged in the SOR. I therefore did not consider that drug \nuse as disqualifying conduct. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, which Applicant denied, alleges that he intends to continue using \nmarijuana in the future. If established by the record evidence, AG \u00b6 25(g) would apply. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is arguably based on Applicant\u2019s SCA, on which he answered, \u201cYes\u201d to the \nquestion, \u201cDo you intend to use this drug or controlled substance in the future?\u201d A \nreading of what he reported on his SCA suggests that he had used THC to treat his \nsickle cell anemia and would continue to do so in the future. However, Applicant \nclarified both in his second OPM interview and in his hearing testimony that he had \nnever used THC medicinally and would not do so in the future.  \nApplicant also stated in his background interview that \u201c[w]ith regard to future \nintentions, [he] does not intend to seek out THC but if he it [sic] is offered to him, he \ndoes not plan to turn it down.\u201d (GE 2 at 10) AG \u00b6 25(h) arguably applies to this \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstatement. However, Applicant did not renew this statement at hearing, or otherwise \nindicate an \u201cexpressed intent to continue\u201d using THC or marijuana. I therefore cannot \nfind that AG \u00b6 25(h) currently applies. SOR \u00b6 1.b is not established.  \nNevertheless, even though Applicant did not state an express intention to \ncontinue using marijuana in the future, that does not end the analysis. Since SOR \u00b6 1.a \nis established, the analysis turns to possible application of mitigating conditions. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nIn examining the frequency and recency of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, I must look \nto his pre-hearing statements (on his SCA, in his background interviews, and in his \nAnswer) and to his hearing testimony. At his hearing, Applicant steadfastly asserted that \nhe had used marijuana twice, not more than that, since 2013. Once was on a fishing trip \nin 2013, and a second time was at a wedding in another state, in either 2016 or 2017. In \nhis earlier statements, Applicant noted two other specific instances, on his birthday and \nat a cookout. He reported both those instances on his February 2017 SCA, with specific \ndetails. In his background interviews, Applicant said he used marijuana four to six times \nand gave a timeframe of between March 2013 and July 2017 (after his SCA). When he \nauthenticated the interview summaries in his August 2019 interrogatory response, \nApplicant made no changes to the portion of the interviews concerning his history of \nTHC use. Applicant also admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a, (which alleged marijuana use as recently \nas July 2017) without making a correction or comment. \nI find Applicant\u2019s pre-hearing statements on the subject of his prior drug use to be \nmore credible than his hearing testimony. I therefore find it more likely that he used \nmarijuana as recently as July 2017, likely in a social setting. The exact frequency (four \nor six uses instead of two) matters less than the fact that I conclude that Applicant \nminimized his involvement. The recency matters as well, particularly the fact that \nApplicant not only used marijuana with a clearance (which he acknowledged), but also \nused marijuana after submitting his most recent SCA (use he did not acknowledge). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that \u201cdrug involvement after having completed \nan SCA draws into serious question the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness \nto follow rules and regulations, insofar as it placed the applicant on notice of the \nconsequences of such misconduct.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 16-02877 at 3 (Oct. 2, 2017); \nISCR Case No. 15-01905 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2017)). Given my findings as to the \ntiming of Applicant\u2019s most recent use of marijuana, I cannot ignore this precedent. \nApplicant also has a history of more serious drug use. He acknowledged prior \nheroin use, as well as treatment for it, and a relapse at some point, evidently many \nyears ago. Applicant\u2019s prior use of heroin is dated and is not alleged as a security \nconcern, nor have I considered it as such. I can consider it, however, in weighing \nmitigation and changed circumstances. Applicant\u2019s prior heroin involvement, even \nthough it was many years ago, cuts against Applicant here, as it means his far more \nrecent use of marijuana is not isolated. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is relatively recent. It also occurred while he held a \nsecurity clearance, and, most recently, after he submitted his most recent SCA. These \nare circumstances that cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 25(a) therefore does not apply. \nApplicant provided a statement of intent not to use marijuana in the future. He \ntestified that he no longer regularly sees his cousin who gave him the marijuana. He \ndisclosed his marijuana use on his SCA, including use with a clearance. But, as noted \nabove, Applicant did not acknowledge using marijuana after submitting his SCA, despite \nrecord evidence that he used marijuana as recently as July 2017. AG \u00b6 25(b) has some \napplication, but does not fully apply to mitigate his drug involvement. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case, and the record evidence, including Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony and other statements, as well as the whole-person evidence from his work \nreferences.

(GE 1; Transcript (Tr.) 18-20, 55, 54) \nThe SOR alleges five debts totaling approximately $27,438. Applicant attributes \nhis financial problems that occurred in about 2010 or 2011 to when he helped some family \nmembers with medical expenses. He was unable to recall the amount. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($12,188) was for a loan to purchase a vehicle in 2007.

He attempted to refinance the loan, but due to the age of the vehicle \nat the time, he was unable. The vehicle was voluntarily repossessed in about 2012. He \nrecently attempted to negotiate a settlement, but the creditor wanted $5,000 immediately, \nand Applicant was unable to pay it. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 37-41) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($7,453) is for a credit card that was opened about 2007. \nDue to the medical issues in his family, he defaulted on the account in about 2010 or \n2011. Applicant testified he has not taken action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 41-43) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,270) is a collection account from 2018 owed for medical \nservices that Applicant believed were covered by his medical savings account. The \namount owed exceeded the balance in the medical savings account. Applicant was \ncontacted by a law firm representing the collector and an agreement was made in 2020 \nwhereby Applicant would make payments of $100 a month. He provided an account \nsummary of his payments. From March 2020, when the agreement began, to July 2021, \nhe failed to make seven monthly payments.

At the time of hearing, \npayments had not started. (Tr. 42-45 GE 2; AE C) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($6,133) is a judgment from 2013.

He stated in 2013, when the judgment was entered, \nhe began making monthly payments of $114 for ten months. He said that in 2013 he was \nunable to contact the creditor. He said he was unable to locate the original creditor. He \ndid not provide any documents to substantiate any payments or attempts to resolve the \njudgment. (Tr. 46-49) \nApplicant has other delinquent debts on accounts that were opened in 2019 and \nwent to collection in May 2020 that were not alleged in the SOR. He is attempting to \nresolve them. He admitted that it was after his receipt of the SOR that he began to address \nsome of his delinquent debts. He plans to tackle the smaller debts first. He said his current \nfinances are fine, and he and his wife live within their means. They own 2020 and 2021 \nvehicles. His wife has about $6,000 in her savings account. It is not a joint account. He \ndoes not have a savings account. He has about $6,000 in a pension plan. Applicant\u2019s wife \nhandles the finances. He stated his wife has a budget, but he has not taken the initiative \nto access it. He has not participated in financial counseling. (I have not considered any \nderogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR for disqualifying purposes. I may \nconsider such in my whole-person analysis, in mitigation, and when making a credibility \ndetermination.) (Tr. 31-35, 49-66) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has five delinquent debts that he began accumulating in about 2010 or \n2011 totaling approximately $27,438. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to helping some family members with \nmedical expenses in about 2010 or 2011. This was a condition beyond his control. For \nthe full application of AG \u00b6 20(b) Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He has a payment plan with one creditor that began in March 2020, but \nhe has made inconsistent payments. He has a payment plan with another creditor that \nwas to begin in August 2021. He has not taken action to resolve the two largest debts \nand the judgment. Applicant admitted that he failed to take any action to resolve his \ndelinquent debts until after he received the SOR in December 2019. The family medical \nissues that impacted his finances occurred more than ten years ago. His debts are \nongoing. I cannot find that future problems are unlikely to recur. His failure to do anything \nabout his delinquent debts for years casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and \ngood judgment. He has not acted responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.

He also has a payment plan to \nresolve another debt, but he had not yet started the payments. There is insufficient \nevidence that Applicant is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors, \ndespite his payment plans. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts began accumulating in 2010 or 2011. He failed to take \naction to resolve his debts until after he received the SOR. He has two payment plans. \nOne he has made inconsistent payments and the other he had not begun making \npayments at the time of his hearing. The timing of resolution of financial problems is an \nimportant factor in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \ntakes action to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice his or her \nclearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment, and self-discipline to follow rules and \nregulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant and his wife earn respectable incomes, yet little progress has been made \non resolving Applicant\u2019s financial problems. To the contrary, he has accumulated \nadditional delinquent debts. At this juncture, Applicant has an unreliable financial track \nrecord, and he has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in 2005 \nand 2007, respectively. He married in 2011 and adopted his wife\u2019s child, and they have \nthree children from the marriage. He has worked for his current employer, a federal \ncontractor, since July 2016. (Transcript (Tr.) 16-19, 43; GE 1) \nApplicant worked at Company W from April 2015 to April 2016. He explained \nCompany W grew while he was there from about 12 to 15 employees to about 20 to 30 \nemployees. He explained the work environment changed. He applied for another job in \nMarch 2016 and received an offer on March 31, 2016. He completed his security \nclearance application on April 10, 2016. He testified that he had been vocal about \nbusiness practices and was told that the company would not eliminate positions. He was \nterminated from his position on April 18, 2016. (Tr. 20-23) \nApplicant testified that on the day he was terminated from his job he went to the \noffice and observed that someone was at his workstation and on his computer. He was \nmet by his supervisor and the director of human resources. He was told his position was \nbeing eliminated. He believed it was because he had been outspoken in the past. He said \nthey had a civil and tense discussion. (Tr. 24-26) \nApplicant testified that he went back to his office, collected his belongings, and left \nthe building. He sat in his car and felt badly because he had unfinished work he intended \nto complete and work that he had not yet started that needed to be completed. This \ntroubled him greatly because he is a professional and conscientious. He wanted to make \nsure his clients were treated correctly. (Tr. 25-27, 46) \nApplicant then went home and accessed his home computer and through it he \naccessed a third-party software tracking program that had Company W\u2019s client\u2019s \ninformation. This is a project management program he used while working at Company \nW, which tracks the status of the work for each client. Applicant stated he did not access \nCompany W\u2019s internal data system. He could only see the status of work that was to be \ndone for the clients. He explained this was the only way he could attend to matters that \nhe had meant to complete. He arranged client cards and assignments that needed to be \nupdated or archived.

He was not granted approval by anyone at Company W to access the \nsoftware or make any changes. No one explicitly gave him permission to do this. He said \nhe left a voice mail for his supervisor, who had been present when he was terminated, \nand told her he was going to archive cards on the software that needed modification and \ntaken off the action list. He said he also told a co-worker what he had done. He admitted \nthat he was angry and upset after being terminated. He decided to access the software \nbecause it was the only way to make peace with what had happened and to make things \nright. He thought Company W was unfair and unjust and had done a disservice to the \nclient. He was going to take the high road and make things right for the client. Before he \nlogged in at home he did not contact anyone at Company W. (Tr. 27-35, 44-58; GE 2, 3, \n5) \nApplicant stated that when a card is archived it is no longer available at a specified \nlocation to determine its progress status. He archived 46 cards. By archiving a card, it is \nput in a different location. It is not deleted. Someone would not be able to find it where \nthey normally expected it to be. He admitted it would be challenging for the next person \nworking for a client to find their information if they did not know where the card was \nlocated. He admitted his actions made things more difficult for his successor. When asked \nwhy he archived a card when he could have notified someone that it was inaccurate. \nApplicant explained that he felt like it was up to him to do it. This was his work and \nresponsibility, and he was going to clean it up. He did not have time to modify each card, \nso he chose to archive some and inform the supervisors later. When asked why not ask \nthe supervisors first. He said because he did not think to do so. He said he thought \nprofessionally the client deserved to have the work performed properly, and he did not \nwant to leave a bad impression. He stated that he felt like this was the best he could do \nto clean up work. He described it as putting things back in the file cabinet and not leaving \nthings out on the table, figuratively speaking. (Tr. 35-40, 50-58, GE 2, 3, 5) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2017. Applicant \nwas confronted with information that in about April 2016 he was terminated from \nemployment at Company W and before the IT department deactivated access to one of \nthe systems, Applicant had remotely accessed the system and began deleting data until \nanother analysist discovered it, and Applicant\u2019s access was suspended. Applicant told \nthe investigator it never happened. He said that he never remotely accessed any of \nCompany W\u2019s systems. The only time his access was denied was the day he was \nterminated. He told the investigator that he was called and informed that he was going to \nbe terminated. He could not provide any other information to the investigator with regards \nto his employment termination from Company W. (Tr. 35-40; GE 2) \nApplicant explained at his hearing that he interpreted the investigator\u2019s questions \nas asking if he had accessed Company W\u2019s internal systems, which he said he had not. \nHe admitted that the only Internet system he could access at home through Company W \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nwas the third-party software.

He thought \nthe investigator had asked had he gone into Company W\u2019s system and deleted and \nmanipulated data. He admitted he never provided clarification or explained the nuance \nhe was relying upon to the investigator. He said he did not lie, but rather it was a \nmisunderstanding. I did not find Applicant credible and find he deliberately misled the \ninvestigator by concealing his actions upon termination from employment with Company \nW. (Tr. 35-41, 58-61) \nApplicant admitted he had pornography on his work computer. He admitted that it \nwas \u201cillicit material\u201d, and he believed it was against work policy to have it on his work \ncomputer. He downloaded photos from the Internet to his computer. He said the photos \nwere boudoir photos of his wife and others. He liked them, so he kept them on his \ncomputer for access. When asked why he had illicit photos on his computer, he explained \nhe thought they were nice, good photographic work, and he was able to view them as a \nbreak from work. He did not refer to the photos as pornography. (Tr. 61-65) \nApplicant stated that he was not making good decisions while working at Company \nW. It was very stressful. He should not have had illicit material on his work computer. He \nshould have gotten permission to access the software tied to Company W\u2019s clients. He is \nnot proud of his conduct. He believed there was a misunderstanding between the \ngovernment investigator and himself. (Tr. 66-68) \nTwo character witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. His manager of two years \nstated that he has worked closely with him on projects as a mentor and technical advisor. \nHe is dedicated to his work and his performance has been excellent. He is hard working, \nconscientious, and takes on many tasks and provides exemplary work. Applicant had \ndiscussed issues he had with his previous employer with the witness, but not the issues \nraised by the SOR. (Tr.71-75) \nAnother witness, who Applicant has worked for on military and sensitive projects, \ntestified that Applicant has met all of the objectives of his work, on time and within budget. \nThey deal with very complex tasks. Applicant is reliable and trustworthy. The witness was \nnot aware of the contents of the SOR. (Tr. 77-78) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for use of information technology is \nset out in AG & 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n(b) unauthorized modification, destruction, or manipulation of, or denial of \naccess to, an information technology system or any data in such system; \nand \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system \nAfter being terminated from employment and without authorization, Applicant \naccessed Company W\u2019s client information from a third-party software program utilized by \nCompany W from his home computer. He deleted and modified client information. \nApplicant also downloaded and stored illicit material on his work computer. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom use of information technology. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness;  \n(c) The conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear\ninstructions. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was deliberate and intentional. After being terminated he was \nangry. He repeatedly justified his conduct and indicated he was responsible for finishing \nwork for clients that belonged to Company W after he was fired because he is a \nprofessional. He changed and manipulated data. He downloaded illicit photos of his wife \nand others onto his work computer because he liked to view them at work during his \nbreak. Applicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. He was not authorized to make changes to client information after he was \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nterminated. His misuse was not minor. He did not make a good-faith effort to obtain \nauthorization prior to accessing data from his home computer. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to any employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \nand  \n(d) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacterizes indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified of sensitive information.  \nApplicant accessed Company W\u2019s client information from his home computer after \nbeing terminated from employment. He downloaded and stored illicit photos on his work \ncomputer while working for Company W. These matters were alleged under Guideline M \nand cross-alleged under Guideline E. They have been adequately addressed under the \nGuideline M. AG \u00b6 16(d) does not apply. \n7 \n \nApplicant deliberately provided misleading information to a government \ninvestigator during his background interview by failing to explain and concealing the fact \nthat he accessed Company W\u2019s client information from his home computer after being \nterminated, albeit from a third-party software program. He told the investigator that he \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \nnever remotely accessed any of Company W\u2019s systems. His explanation at his hearing \nthat he did not access Company W\u2019s internal Internet without further explanation to the \ninvestigator was intentionally deceptive. He obviously was aware of what the government \ninvestigator\u2019s inquiries were about, yet concealed his involvement. He told the investigator \nthat he could not provide any other information in regards to his termination. AG \u00b6 16(b) \napplies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not make a good-faith effort to explain or correct what he described \nas a misunderstanding. His concealment was intentional, and his conduct was deceptive. \nMisleading a government investigator during a background interview for a security \nclearance is serious and casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines M and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline M, Use of Information Technology, and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for at least the 2013 through 2017 tax years (SOR 1.a); that he failed to pay, as required, his federal income taxes for at least the 2013 through 2016 tax years (SOR 1.b); and that he owed the IRS $18,312.85 for unpaid income taxes from the 2014 through 2016 tax years (SOR 1.c). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations all of the SOR allegations. He also provided a recent copy of his pay stub and a record of tax payments made between August 2017 and July 2019. (Answer) On August 17, 2021, after receiving pre-hearing a copy of Applicant\u2019s proposed exhibits, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR. SOR 1.b, as amended, alleged that Applicant\u2019s failure to timely pay his federal income taxes occurred between 2013 and 2018. SOR 1.c, as amended, alleged that Applicant owes $28,451.50 for unpaid taxes from the 2014 through 2018 tax years. Applicant denied SOR 1.b and 1.c, as amended. After reviewing the proposed exhibits and allowing the parties to be heard, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion and amended the SOR to conform to the evidence as 2 provided by Directive, Section E3.1.17. (Tr. 11 \u2013 18) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admission to SOR 1.a, and by the remarks he made in his initial response to the SOR, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 55 years old. Since March 2003, he has worked for a d",

The guideline cited in the SOR was part of the current set \nof adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on \nDecember 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I first \nreceived the case on January 16, 2020, and scheduled a hearing for March 31, 2020. On \nMarch 20, 2020, I cancelled that hearing in response to pandemic-related restrictions \nimposed by the Secretary of Defense. On July 13, 2021, I rescheduled this case for \nhearing on August 19, 2021 via web-based video conferencing. The parties appeared as \nscheduled. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2. Applicant \ntestified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 I. Additionally, I held the record open \nafter the hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional information. The record closed on \nSeptember 1, 2021, when I received Applicant\u2019s timely post-hearing submissions and \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s waiver of objection thereto. DOHA received a transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on August 27, 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions consisted of AX J (a two-page statement \nfrom Applicant); AX K (three one-page letters of recommendation); AX L (Applicant\u2019s four-\npage IRS transcript for the 2013 tax year); and AX M (Applicant\u2019s three-page IRS \ntranscript for the 2014 tax year). All exhibits were admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for at least the 2013 through 2017 tax years (SOR 1.a); that \nhe failed to pay, as required, his federal income taxes for at least the 2013 through 2016 \ntax years (SOR 1.b); and that he owed the IRS $18,312.85 for unpaid income taxes from \nthe 2014 through 2016 tax years (SOR 1.c). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nwith explanations all of the SOR allegations. He also provided a recent copy of his pay \nstub and a record of tax payments made between August 2017 and July 2019. (Answer) \nOn August 17, 2021, after receiving pre-hearing a copy of Applicant\u2019s proposed \nexhibits, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR. SOR 1.b, as amended, alleged \nthat Applicant\u2019s failure to timely pay his federal income taxes occurred between 2013 and \n2018. SOR 1.c, as amended, alleged that Applicant owes $28,451.50 for unpaid taxes \nfrom the 2014 through 2018 tax years. Applicant denied SOR 1.b and 1.c, as amended. \nAfter reviewing the proposed exhibits and allowing the parties to be heard, I granted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion and amended the SOR to conform to the evidence as \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprovided by Directive, Section E3.1.17. (Tr. 11 \u2013 18) In addition to the facts established \nby Applicant\u2019s admission to SOR 1.a, and by the remarks he made in his initial response \nto the SOR, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. Since March 2003, he has worked for a defense \ncontractor as an information technology systems field engineer, a position that requires \neligibility for access to classified information for access to military facilities at home and \nabroad. Applicant has held a security clearance since at least March 2004. He also served \nin the Army on active duty between 1984 and 1993. Thereafter, he affiliated with the Army \nReserve until retiring in 2017. After leaving active duty, he earned an associate\u2019s degree \nin applied science and a bachelor\u2019s degree in technology management. Applicant has \nbeen married since 1987 and has three children, one of whom is still his dependent. (GX \n1; Tr. 46 \u2013 48) \nBetween 2003 and 2017, Applicant was sent at least five times by his employer to \nwork in direct support of U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Qatar. \nHe disclosed in his 2018 e-QIP that he filed his federal and state income tax returns late \nfor the 2012, 2013, and 2017 tax years, and that he owed a total of $4,100 in unpaid taxes \nfor those years. Information obtained by investigators and adjudicators during the ensuing \nbackground investigation showed that in March 2019, he resolved a $34,391 debt for \nunpaid state taxes for the 2013 through 2016 tax years. Available information also \nshowed that Applicant has been late in filing his federal returns on time for the 2013 \nthrough 2020 tax years. The record does not show that he has ever applied for an \nextension of the filing deadline. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; AX A \u2013 H; AX J; Tr. 48, 85 \u2013 86) \n \nInformation obtained during Applicant\u2019s background investigation shows that he \nowed $18,132.85 for unpaid taxes in the 2014 through 2016 tax years. At hearing, \nApplicant provided information showing that, as of December 9, 2020, he owed $28,451 \nfor unpaid taxes in the 2014 through 2018 tax years. The same information shows that, \nas of August 4, 2021, he owed $19,022 in unpaid taxes for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax \nyears, the 2014 and 2015 tax year debts having been satisfied. In July 2015, Applicant \nentered into a repayment agreement with the IRS to make $151 monthly payments to \nresolve his tax debt. That repayment agreement subsequently has been renewed at least \nannually as his failures to file and pay his taxes continued, and as his total tax debt \nincreased. His monthly payments were increased with each renewal, first to $191, then \nto $250. He now pays $350 each month. His tax debts also have been reduced through \ninvoluntary diversion of any tax refunds he was due after filing. (Answer; GX 2; AX A \u2013 J, \nAX L; Tr. 66 \u2013 78, 92) \nApplicant asserts that he did not file his 2013 federal and state returns because he \nfound himself owing additional taxes as a result of increased income from working \noverseas. He was not trying to avoid paying taxes but was somehow confused about how \nhe should file his returns given his unexpected payment obligation. He also claims he did \nnot know how to change his income tax withholdings to avoid having to pay after filing, \nand he has acknowledged that he did not properly manage his finances until recently. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFurther, Applicant did not establish that his 2013 filing requirements were any different \nthan his filing requirements when he worked overseas the previous ten years. It was not \nuntil 2016 that Applicant took action to file his past-due returns with the help of a \ncommercial tax preparation company. In 2017, he started using a private tax preparer \nwho has helped him file his returns for the 2018, 2019, and 2020 tax years. Applicant is \nnow current on all of his tax reporting obligations, and his tax preparer has helped him \nadjust his income tax withholdings to a level appropriate for his income. (Answer; GX 2; \nAX F; AX J; AX L; Tr. 43 \u2013 44, 49 \u2013 52, 60 \u2013 66, 81, 85 \u2013 87) \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are otherwise sound. He has no other outstanding \ndebts, and he brings home in excess of $10,000 each month after taxes and other \ndeductions. Applicant estimates that, after expenses, he has about $2,500 remaining \neach month, funds which he invests in a portfolio worth about $400,000. Applicant \nacknowledged at his hearing that he has the means with which to resolve his current tax \ndebt. He prefers not to do so, explaining that he is \u201ckind of okay with [paying the IRS] \n$370 a month.\u201d (Tr. 53 \u2013 59, 94 \u2013 96) \nApplicant has an excellent reputation in the workplace and his community. \nAssociates who have known and worked with Applicant for most of the past 25 years, and \nwho are aware of his tax problems, praise Applicant for his honesty, integrity, \ntrustworthiness, and professionalism. (AX K) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant did not timely file his federal and state income tax returns for at least five \nconsecutive tax years, and he failed to pay his federal taxes for six consecutive years, \namassing a debt for unpaid taxes in excess of $28,000. He is now current on his tax \nreporting obligations; however, he still owes about $19,000 in unpaid taxes and is \nunwilling to resolve his tax debts more expeditiously outside of his agreement with the \nIRS despite having the means to do so. This information reasonably raised a security \nconcern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAs amended, the allegation at SOR 1.b is resolved for Applicant because it is \nsubsumed by the more informative allegation at SOR 1.c. Nonetheless, the Government\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation sufficiently supported SOR 1.a and 1.c. Accordingly, available information \nrequires application of the following AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s information requires \nconsideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s tax debt remains largely \nunpaid and Applicant chooses not to use the resources he has at hand to more timely \nresolve his tax debts. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies because he reached a repayment agreement \nwith the IRS in 2015; however, the value of this mitigating condition is attenuated by his \ncontinued failure to file and pay his taxes even after he entered into the agreement. \nApplicant has the means to pay this debt now but has chosen not to. At the current $370 \nmonthly rate of repayment, his $19,000 remaining balance will take another 51 months to \nresolve. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply because Applicant did not show that his failure to file \nand pay his taxes as required arose from circumstances beyond his control. Making more \nmoney usually means having to pay more taxes. When Applicant was faced with that \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nprospect, he stopped filing his returns. Although he reached an IRS-approved agreement \nin 2015, he did not address the underlying problem until 2017, when he filed his past-due \nreturns and adjusted his tax withholdings. Still, he has not acted to resolve his tax debt \nmore expeditiously, despite having the means to do so. His choice to continue investing \nhis disposable income rather than prioritizing resolution of his tax debt weakens any claim \nthat he acted responsibly in the face of unforeseen circumstances. Applicant\u2019s stated \nreasons for not meeting his tax reporting and payment obligations were not plausible. \nEven if they were, they would not support a finding that his tax problems arose from \ncircumstances beyond his control. On balance, Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). The favorable recommendations from his long-time friends and associates \nare not sufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s knowing failure \nover several years to comply with his tax reporting and payment obligations or to promptly \nresolve those issues. Those security concerns remain unresolved and sustain doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s suitability for continued access to classified information. Because \nprotection of the interests of national security is the principal focus of these adjudications, \nthose doubts must be resolved against the Applicant\u2019s request for clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR (as amended) as required \nby section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

Edmunds, Esq. \n04/27/2021 \nDecision \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) \nand E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 14, 2017. The \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) determined that it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him access to classified information, and on November 15, 2019, it sent \nhim a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines J \n(Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct). The CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 4, 2020, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 10, 2020, \nand the case was assigned to me on February 16, 2021. On February 19, 2021, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for March 16, 2021. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through N, which were admitted without \nobjection. AX A through H duplicated exhibits that were attached to Applicant\u2019s answer to \nthe SOR. I kept the record open until March 22, 2021, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence, and he timely submitted AX O and P (mislabeled as \nAX I and J), which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nMarch 31, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old computer system analyst employed by a federal \ncontractor since February 2020. He has been employed by federal contractors for various \njobs since May 2007. He has held a security clearance since June 2012. \nApplicant married in February 2003, divorced in April 2004, and married in October \n2010. He and his wife have a three-year-old son. He has a 13-year-old daughter from an \nearlier relationship. He was unaware that he had a daughter until he was contacted by \nher mother when their daughter was five years old. (Tr. 21.) \nApplicant grew up in the foster-care system, living with multiple families and group \nhomes. As a person of color growing up in a predominantly white area, he encountered \nfrequent instances of racism and harassment. In high school he found tobacco spit on his \nlocker and letters in his locker calling him the \u201cN\u201d word. He received threatening telephone \ncalls and was ejected from restaurants. (Tr. 19-20.) \nApplicant served on active duty as a combat engineer in the U.S. Army from \nFebruary 2002 to August 2006. He served two tours of duty in a combat zone and was \nhonorably discharged as a sergeant. He received the Army Commendation Medal three \ntimes. Notwithstanding his receipt of nonjudicial punishment shortly before his discharge \n(discussed below), he received the Good Conduct Medal. (AX K.) \nApplicant received an associate\u2019s degree in May 2008 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nsports management in July 2012. He also has received numerous technical certifications \nin computer security and physical fitness. (AX L.) \nThe SOR alleges 12 instances of criminal conduct. The evidence concerning those \ninstances is summarized below in chronological order. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. In April 1997, Applicant was charged with criminal mischief. Although \nhe admitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR, he testified at the hearing that he \ncould not remember anything about it. (Tr. 27.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. In July 1997, Applicant was charged with 2d degree assault, a felony, \nand 3rd degree assault, a misdemeanor. Although he admitted this allegation in his answer \nto the SOR, he testified at the hearing that he could not remember anything about it. (Tr. \n27.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j. In July 1999, Applicant was at a park with a group of friends when they \nwere confronted by another group, and a brawl ensued. All the participants were charged \nwith felony criminal mischief and harassment. Applicant paid a $150 fine for harassment. \nHe disclosed this incident in a previous SCA submitted in September 2008. (GX 1 at 32; \nGX 4 at 10.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.f: In December 1999, Applicant was charged with underage \npossession of alcohol. He testified that he remembered that the police came to a party, \nand he paid a $25 fine. (GX 1 at 30; GX 4 at 12.) He was arrested again for underage \npossession of alcohol in May 2001. He testified that this arrest occurred when he was \nriding as a passenger in a car with an open container of alcohol. (Tr. 24.) He was \nsentenced to 30 hours of community service. (GX 1 at 28; GX 4 at 12.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i. In April 2001, Applicant was charged with trespassing in April \n2001 and May 2001. He paid a $50 fine for each offense. (GX 1 at 29-30.) At the hearing, \nhe testified that he could not remember the circumstances of these incidents, but he \nremembered that they occurred at a gas station. (Tr. 24-25, 50.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. In September 2004, while Applicant was on active duty, he was \ncharged with battery and disorderly conduct after being involved in a fight outside a bar. \nApplicant testified that he remembered the incident but did not remember the outcome. \n(Tr. 24.) He testified that he did not remember whether he had been drinking alcohol. (Tr. \n44.) The battery charge, for hitting a female bar employee in the face as she tried to break \nup the fight, was dismissed for lack of evidence. He was convicted of disorderly conduct \nand sentenced to 10 days in jail (suspended) and a $266 fine. (GX 5 at 6-8; GX 7.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. On June 25, 2006, Applicant was involved with an incident with the \nmilitary police. According to the police report, Applicant was ordered by military police to \nshow his identification and became disorderly and disrespectful. When the military police \nattempted to apprehend him, he resisted and began threatening them. He was taken to \nthe military police station, processed, and released to his first sergeant. The military police \nreport reflects that alcohol was involved. (GX 6 at 5.) On July 25, 2006, his company \ncommander imposed nonjudicial punishment for resisting apprehension, disorderly \nconduct, and disrespect toward a superior. His punishment was an oral reprimand and \n14 days of extra duty. His company commander noted on the record of punishment that \nhis last day of active duty was on July 28, 2006, three days after punishment was \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted an earlier SCA in September 2008, he answered \u201cno\u201d \nto the following question: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been subject to court martial or \nother disciplinary proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice? (Include non-\njudicial, Captain\u2019s mast, etc.).\u201d At the hearing, he testified that he did not remember \nresponding to the question. When confronted with a copy of the SCA, he said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t \nsay Article 15. It says court-martial.\u201d He also testified that he did not know that \n\u201cnonjudicial\u201d included Article 15. (Tr. 41-42.) He was not asked and did not address \nwhether he thought his punishment was \u201cother disciplinary proceedings.\u201d His failure to \ndisclose his nonjudicial punishment in his 2008 SCA was not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nimposed. (GX 6 at 2.) Although Applicant admitted this incident in his answer to the SOR, \nhe testified at the hearing that he did not remember anything about it. (Tr. 39.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. In November 2014, Applicant was visiting his daughter from a previous \nrelationship, who was then six years old. After a brief visit, he told his daughter\u2019s mother \nabout his plans for future visits. According to Applicant, his daughter\u2019s mother said, \u201cOver \nmy dead body,\u201d and started to walk away. Applicant then touched her shoulder and said, \n\u201cLet\u2019s not make this harder than it needs to be.\u201d His daughter\u2019s mother sprayed him with \npepper spray and called the police. He was arrested and charged with assault by contact \nand spent three or four hours in jail. He appeared before a judge in May 2015, pleaded \nno contest, and was granted deferred disposition. He completed a 45-day probation, and \nthe charges were dismissed in July 2015. (Tr. 39; GX 4 at 8; AX H.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. In July 2016, a police officer found Applicant slumped over in his car \nin a street intersection and noticed a strong smell of alcohol. The police report reflected \nthat Applicant was awakened by the police and attempted to start his car and drive away. \nAfter the police shut of his ignition and he exited the vehicle, he was agitated and began \ncursing at the police. (GX 3 at 18.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that he could not \nremember any interactions he had with the police. (Tr. 35.) Two breathalyzer tests \nregistered a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.173 and 0.160. He was charged with driving \nunder the influence (DUI) and impeding traffic. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to \nconfinement for 12 months and 40 hours of community service. The confinement was \nprobated and he was placed on unsupervised probation. He completed a court-ordered \nevaluation, community service, a risk-reduction course, and a DUI school. The evaluator, \na certified alcohol and drug counselor, concluded that he had \u201cno apparent alcohol \nproblem\u201d and that alcohol or drug treatment was not recommended. (GX 3 at 42-43.) \nApplicant completed his probation in December 2018. (GX 3 at 3, 18-28; AX F.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he could not remember if he disclosed any \nearlier criminal arrests to the evaluator. (Tr. 37-38.) The record of the court-ordered \nevaluation reflects that he disclosed his DUI and an arrest for disorderly conduct, but he \ndenied having any other charges or arrests in his lifetime. (GX 3 at 40.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. In June 2017, Applicant and his wife, who was six months pregnant, \nhad an argument while at a party. Applicant testified that he had been drinking at the party \nbut could not remember if he was drunk. (Tr. 33.) The argument continued when they \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwent home, and Applicant\u2019s wife hit him with a curling iron. According to Applicant, he \ngrabbed her to keep her from hitting him. When he let her go, she grabbed her cellphone \nand said that she was calling the police. At some point, he pushed his wife into an \nunlocked closet. She got out of the closet, and they both went outside into the yard. \nApplicant took her cellphone from her, threw it into a neighbor\u2019s yard, left the house, and \nreturned to the party. The next morning they apologized to each other. (Tr. 28-33.) \nApplicant and his wife participated in marital counseling from July to November \n2017. (AX G.) In November 2017, Applicant\u2019s security officer told him that there was an \noutstanding warrant for his arrest. He went to the police station to inquire about the \nwarrant and was arrested for battery, family violence, and impeding his wife from making \na 911 call. Initially, he had also been charged with an aggravated assault by strangulation, \na felony, but prosecution of that offense was declined because there was no evidence of \nstrangulation. (AX E.) \nAfter the felony charge was withdrawn, Applicant remained on pretrial probation. \nIn August 2018, he completed a court-ordered anger-management course. (AX A.) In \nOctober 2018, he was placed in a family violence intervention program, consisting of 24 \nmandatory classes. In March 2019, he completed the intervention program, and the \nprosecutor entered a nolle prosequi for the charges of battery, domestic violence, and \nimpeding a 911 call. (GX 3 at 9, 11, 13, 16; AX B; AX D.) \nThe commander of the military facility where Applicant was working as a contractor \nemployee terminated Applicant\u2019s access to the facility until the charges based on the July \n2017 incident were resolved. Because Applicant could no longer work at the facility, he \nwas terminated from his employment in December 2017. However, his employer \nsubmitted a letter recommending that his security clearance be reinstated, because \nduring his employment, he \u201cnever showed any behavior to question his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. (AX C at 1.) \nApplicant was unemployed until February 2020, when he was hired by another federal \ncontractor. (AX J.) \nIn addition to the charges alleged in the SOR, Applicant was charged with 3rd \ndegree criminal mischief in October 1999. This charge was not alleged in the SOR, but \nApplicant disclosed it in his September 2008 SCA. Applicant testified that he punched out \nthe windows in his girlfriend\u2019s car after a friend of his girlfriend spit in his face and called \nhim the \u201cN\u201d word. (Tr. 49). In his 2008 SCA, he stated that the incident occurred during \nan argument with his girlfriend. (GX 1 at 31. He was fined $1,200 and ordered to perform \n150 hours of community service. (GX 1 at 30-31.) At the hearing, he said that he could \nnot remember if he had been drinking before he punched out the windows. (Tr. 50.) I have \nconsidered this unalleged conduct for the limited purposes of evaluating Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility, to determine whether he has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and as \npart of my whole-person analysis.

Applicant testified that he now \nconsumes one or two beers once or twice a month. (Tr. 22.) \nOne of Applicant\u2019s former supervisors submitted a letter describing him as honest, \ntrustworthy, respectful, and a compassionate person with praiseworthy perseverance and \nambition. (AX C at 2.) Applicant\u2019s current program manager considers him a talented and \nconscientious employee, a dedicated husband and father, and \u201cthe type of individual I am \nglad to have hired.\u201d (AX N at 3.) Two long-time friends consider him \u201csmart and honest,\u201d \nand a person who \u201clives his life with integrity.\u201d (AX N at 1-2.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence presented at the hearing establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s arrest in November 2014, for assault \nby touching, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, was an anomaly, unrelated to alcohol and amounting \nto no more than an unwanted touching of his daughter\u2019s mother on the shoulder. I \nconclude that the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is mitigated because it happened under \nunusual circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nApplicant had a pattern of unlawful and disruptive conduct, usually alcohol-related, \nfrom his teenage years until the end of his military service in July 2006. After his discharge \nfrom the Army, ten years elapsed with no alcohol-related criminal conduct. I conclude that \nthe instances of misconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.l are mitigated by the passage of \ntime. \nApplicant\u2019s DUI in July 2016 was followed by the arrest for alcohol-related \ndomestic violence in June 2017. He did not complete the family violence intervention \nprogram until March 2019. I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(a) is not established for the conduct \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b because the incidents were recent and did not occur under \nunusual circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. Applicant has a good employment record and \nreceived a strong endorsement from his previous employer as well as his current \nemployer. However, he did not complete the intervention program until March 2019, and \nhe has been under pressure to regain his security clearance since November 2017. \nInsufficient time has passed to conclude that his criminal behavior will not recur once the \npressure of regaining his security clearance is lifted. \n. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges a consequence of the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a but does \nnot allege any independent conduct of security significance. I have resolved SOR \u00b6 2.a \nfor Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l. The Appeal Board has \nrecognized that specific behavior can have security significance under more than one \nguideline\u201d and the adjudicative guidelines contemplate that \u201cbehavior will have \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nindependent security significance under Guideline E in a broad range of cases.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 06-20964 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008). \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially relevant: \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior; [and] (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations . . . ; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or \ngroup. Such conduct includes : . . engaging in activities which, if known, \ncould affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing. \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is not applicable. The conduct alleged in the SOR does not involve \nadverse information \u201cin several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an \nadverse determination under any other single guideline.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) is not applicable. The conduct alleged in the SOR is \u201cexplicitly covered\u201d \nunder Guideline J. \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is established. Violence against a pregnant wife and a history of \nalcohol-related criminal conduct could affect Applicant\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing and make him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:  \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c-1.i, but not for the \nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, for the reasons set out in the above discussion \nof AG \u00b6 32(a). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) are not fully established. Applicant has not fully and candidly \nacknowledged his behavior. He did not fully disclose his criminal record when he \nunderwent a court-ordered alcohol evaluation, thereby making that evaluation of limited \nprobative value. Except for the court-ordered DUI class, he submitted no evidence of \ncounseling or treatment for his alcohol consumption. At the hearing, he quibbled about \nhis failure to disclose his nonjudicial punishment in his 2008 SCA. See ISCR Case No. \n01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002) (security clearance investigation not a forum to \nsplit hairs or parse the truth narrowly). He responded to numerous questions during the \nhearing by claiming that he could not remember. (Tr. 24, 26, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 44, \n49, 50.) It is plausible that he could not remember the details of some of his teenage \nantics, and it is plausible, given his level of intoxication, that he remembered little about \nhis DUI arrest alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. However, it is not plausible that he could not \nremember whether he was drinking before he smashed his girlfriend\u2019s car windows or \nbefore the bar fight alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Nor it is plausible that he could not remember \nanything about his confrontation with military police alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which led to his \napprehension, detention until he was released to his first sergeant, and subsequent \nnonjudicial punishment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. I have considered that Applicant served honorably \nunder combat conditions in the U.S. Army and that he is respected by former and current \nemployers. I have considered his efforts to overcome his combative tendencies, but I \nhave concerns about his less than full candor regarding the circumstances of his multiple \ncriminal offenses. \u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011), citing Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J and E, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct and personal behavior. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.l: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Her admissions are \nincorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer as an administrative professional since February or March 2019. \nHer job location is currently in Afghanistan. She has worked for a defense contractor in \neither Afghanistan or Iraq for approximately 14 years. She served in the U.S. Army on \nactive duty for six years and was honorably discharged. She deployed to Iraq in 2003. \nShe attained her general educational development (GED) and has taken some college \ncourses. She has never married and has no children. She provides financial support for \nher mother and sisters. (Tr. at 7, 26-30; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 20 delinquent collection and charged-off debts \ntotaling approximately $44,773. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.t) The debts are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and entries on several credit reports. (GE 4-6; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties were exacerbated by two significant events. In 2010 \nto 2011, she was between contractor deployments and decided to start her own business. \nShe accumulated some significant debts from this business start-up. Her business failed \nand she became personally responsible for the delinquent debts. Thereafter, she started \nworking for another contractor in a deployed setting. The second incident that impacted \nher finances was an injury she sustained while deployed in approximately 2015-2016. In \napproximately March 2015, she broke her foot and returned state side. She received \nworkers\u2019 compensation due to her injury until about July 2016 when it stopped. She then \nwent through periods on unemployment and temporary employment until she was hired \nby a defense contractor for a deployment position in September 2017.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAppellant had multiple delinquent debts that were unpaid or unresolved. Both of \nthe above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and    \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAppellant had two periods where she came under financial distress that led to \nsome of her delinquent debts. She started a business between her contractor \ndeployments that ultimately failed and she suffered a serious injury while deployed that \ncaused her to miss significant time from work. She received workers\u2019 compensation for \nsome time, but when it expired, she was unable to return to her previous position. These \nwere circumstances beyond her control. Appellant eventually acted responsibly by \nentering into debt payment plans, settling and paying other debts, and even contacting \ncreditors who disavowed the debts. She also paid a state tax debt outside of her payment \nplan. She has no current outstanding debts and her income is allowing her to accumulate \nsavings. While her financial state is not perfect, perfection is not required. She has \nestablished a track record of steady payments, which have gone to pay her delinquent \ndebts. There are clear indications that her debts are being resolved and that she is making \ngood-faith efforts to do so. Applicant credibly disputed a debt involving her mother\u2019s \nterminated lease. All the above listed mitigating conditions substantially apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s military service, her years of service, both military and civilian, in \na deployment combat area, and the strong recommendation of her current supervisor. \nWhile Applicant could have been timelier in her resolution of her debts, she eventually \npaid them, except for two that could not be located. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.t: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRobert E.

She is making payments under an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \ninstallment plan to address her federal income tax debt, and she plans to start an \ninstallment plan to resolve her state income tax debt soon. She has made progress getting \nher financial house in order; however, she did not prove she was unable to timely file her \nfederal and state tax returns. Financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 30, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn October 4, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), January 2, 1992; as amended, and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.

(HE 2) Applicant provided an undated response to the SOR and \nrequested a hearing. (HE 3)    \n \nOn September 1, 2020, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On September \n18, 2020, the case was assigned to me. On October 23, 2020, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for October \n30, 2020. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. Applicant waived her right to 15 \ndays\u2019 notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 10)   \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant offered 37 \nexhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. \n(Tr. 16-17; GE 1-5; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-AE KK) Applicant provided seven additional \ndocuments after her hearing, which were admitted into evidence without objection.

For \nexample, she admitted that she had the account, but said the debt was under a current \npayment plan. She also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Her admissions \nare accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old systems engineer. (Tr. 19; GE 1) Her current annual \nincome from her systems engineer employment is $119,000. (Tr. 36; AE QQ) She has \nworked as a systems engineer since 2014. (AE N) She also has part-time employment \nworking in a drug store as a cashier, where her annual income is about $5,000. (Tr. 19, \n36) She has held a security clearance since 1998. (Tr. 22) In 1997, she received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in emergency medical services.

(Tr. 20) Applicant served on active duty in the \nArmy for four years and for 12 years in the Army Reserve. (Tr. 20-21) She left the Army \nas a staff sergeant, and she received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 21; AE U) Her Army \nspecialty was medical laboratory specialist. (Tr. 21) \n \nApplicant was deployed to Iraq from March to July or August 2003. (Tr. 22, 74; AE \nLL, at \u00b6 1) She was exposed to hostile fire and danger in Iraq. (Tr. 42) Her deployment to \nIraq was difficult for her husband and children. (AE Y) She returned early from Iraq \nbecause her husband attempted suicide and was hospitalized or partially hospitalized \nfrom July to November 2003. (Tr. 22, 42-43; AE LL at \u00b6\u00b6 2-5) He was making $90,000 \nannually before he became unemployed because of his hospitalization. (Tr. 23) He was \nunemployed or underemployed from 2003 to August 2006. (Tr. 23-24, 40; AE LL at \u00b6\u00b6 5-\n9) In 2004, the mortgage company foreclosed on her home as a result of the reduction in \nfamily income from her husband\u2019s unemployment. (Tr. 23-24, 40; AE BB at 2) \n \nApplicant\u2019s son was hospitalized for substantial periods of time from September \n2009 to October 2011 because of a mental health condition and related behavioral issues. \n(Tr. 24, 45; AE LL at \u00b6\u00b6 10-14; AE OO) TRICARE paid the medical expenses, and she \npaid $2,500 monthly for his educational expenses. (Tr. 24, 45; AE BB at 2) In 2011, her \nson moved to a group home, and in 2015, he moved to foster care. She had to pay the \nstate for the foster and residential care. (AE LL at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 25, 26-27; SOR response) Her \nson was periodically moved to other care facilities, and in July 2018, he moved into the \nfamily home. (AE LL at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 37) In August 2019, her son had knee surgery and was \nunable to work. (AE LL at \u00b6 44)  \n \nFrom 2010 to 2016, Applicant was separated from her spouse because he wanted \nto live away from Applicant and their children. (Tr. 25; AE LL at \u00b6 16) Her husband did not \nprovide child or spousal support. (Tr. 25; AE MM) Her husband was periodically \nunemployed, or underemployed. (AE LL at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 9, 29, 30, 31, 41, 42, 43; AE MM)   \n \nIn 2014, Applicant became unemployed for two months because her employer lost \na government contract, and then when she was again employed, she received a \nsubstantial reduction in her pay. (Tr. 25, 46; AE BB at 2) She took funds out of her \nretirement plan to pay for her son\u2019s care and education. (Tr. 26; SOR response) She had \nsome tenants in her home, and they failed to pay the rent. (Tr. 47; AE BB at 3) Her home \nwent into foreclosure around 2016. (Tr. 47-48; GE 2; AE BB at 3) \n \nIn 2016, Applicant\u2019s husband began living with Applicant again. (AE BB at 3) In \n2017, Applicant allowed another family in desperate financial straits to move in with her, \nher husband, and children because she did not want them to live in a car. (AE BB at 4) \nApplicant did not indicate how long the family lived in her residence. \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband currently lives with Applicant in the same household. (Tr. 36) \nHe is a calibration engineer. (Tr. 36) His annual salary is $67,000; however, he does not \nprovide significant financial support for his family. (Tr. 36-37; AE QQ) He pays for car \ninsurance, the cable bill, and some household maintenance expenses. (Tr. 69; AE QQ) \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s husband died, she moved in with Applicant, and she pays the \nhome heating oil bill out of her Social Security. (Tr. 50, 69; AE QQ)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant provided a detailed listing of her bills on her SCA. (Tr. 72; GE 1) Applicant \nhad a myriad of unexpected financial and family problems: (1) her son and daughter were \nhospitalized several times for depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues; (2) her \nson was unable to work because he injured his knee; (3) her husband had mental-health \nproblems that required inpatient and outpatient treatments and affected his ability and \nwillingness to support his family; and (4) Applicant had disruptions in her income from \nchanges in employment and her tenant\u2019s  failures to pay rent. (Tr. 67; AE BB) Her finances \nhave some positive aspects. She has been continuously employed for the last three \nyears, and her oldest son has left home, is married, and is financially independent. (AE \nBB at 2-4)  \n \nThe SOR alleges 10 delinquent debts totaling $45,803 and failure to file or timely \nfile tax returns as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2011 through 2017. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that she owes federal income taxes \ntotaling $31,234 for tax years 2011 and 2015.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d allege Applicant failed to timely file her state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2011 through 2017.  \n \nApplicant filed as head of household for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and \n2015, and she filed as married filing joint return for tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018. (AE \nA; AE B) The amount owed as of July 2019 is based on IRS account transcripts for tax \nyears 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018. (AE A) Tax returns for tax years 2011, 2013, and 2015 \nwere provided; however, tax transcripts for those years were not provided.

(AE B, IRS \nForm 1040, line 16a) For tax year 2015, Applicant withdrew $42,100 from her pension \nplan. (AE B, IRS Form 1040, line 15b) When Applicant took one of the withdrawals from \nher retirement account, she thought she might be able to take a medical deduction for her \nson\u2019s mental health expenses; however, later she found out it did not qualify because it \nwas an education expense. (Tr. 53) These two withdrawals from her pension plan caused \nmost of her federal income tax debt. \n \nIn 2011, Applicant learned there was an issue with her state income taxes because \na state tax authority filed a lien against her pay for $12,600. (Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) at 7). She blamed the failure to file \nher tax returns on her husband, and said it was due to his mental health issues. (Id.) The \nlien started in April 2012, and it was resolved in 2017. (Id.)  \n \nOn August 30, 2017, Applicant completed her SCA, and she stated: \n \n[The IRS] provided me with what years I need to file and the information on \nmy income for those years as well as where to find the forms and \ninstructions. Once I have filled out the forms as married filing single, I will \nschedule another assistance appointment where I can turn them in and then \nset up a payment plan for any amounts that are owed that day. The [IRS] \nassistance office also provided information on [the] State office of taxation \nin order to ensure I am able to file my state income taxes for those years as \nwell. I will be following up with the [state tax returns] once I have completed \neach federal form. (emphasis added, GE 1 at 45)  \n \nApplicant did not specify in more detail the information she received from the IRS about \nher income and withholdings for tax years 2011, 2013, and 2015. \n \nOn September 20, 2017, Applicant responded to questions from an OPM \ninvestigator substantially as follows: \n \nSubject provided her husband the documents needed to fill out the taxes \nfor [tax years 2011, 2013, and 2015] but he failed to do so due to his \ndepression. \u2026 Subject started filling out the paperwork needed to file and \nwill set up a payment plan after she finishes the paperwork. Subject is \nprioritizing her taxes to the front of the list of things to pay and is willing and \ncapable of paying this debt. Subject had no further details. \n \nFor unfiled or unpaid state income taxes, in her response to DOHA interrogatories \nApplicant indicated in a table that the state owed Applicant a refund for tax year 2011 and \nprovided a refund. (GE 2) For her state tax returns for 2013 and 2015, she wrote that she \nwas in the process of filing those tax returns. (OPM interview at 6) The OPM interviews \nare summaries and are not verbatim. Applicant made the handwritten notes on the \nmargins on some pages such as \u201cpaid in full\u201d by some debts which she intended to be \n\u201ccorrections.\u201d (GE 2)   \n \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nOn July 17, 2019, Applicant agreed to an IRS installment payment plan, in which \nshe agreed to make $453 monthly payments to address her $31,500 federal income tax \ndebt for tax years 2011 and 2015. (AE C) On July 25, 2019, Applicant responded to DOHA \ninterrogatories. (GE 2) On September 22, 2019, she paid the IRS $450, and on October \n22, 2019, she paid the IRS $500. (AE D) Both payments went to address her tax debt for \ntax year 2011. (Id.) On November 21, 2019, she arranged to have an automatic direct \nwithdrawal from her bank account paid to the IRS. (AE E; AE Z) \n \nOn November 25, 2019, the IRS reduced her refund for tax year 2013 to $3,800. \n(AE F) She was unable to receive the federal income tax refund for tax year 2013 because \nher tax return was filed more than three years late. (Tr. 58)  \n \nSince September 2019, Applicant has made all payments under her IRS payment \nplan, and along with her refunds, she has reduced her federal income tax debt to about \n$14,000. (Tr. 28)  \n \nApplicant timely filed her state income tax return for tax year 2017. (AE G) In \nOctober 2020, Applicant filed her state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2015. \n(Tr. 31, 59; AE DD) She owes the state tax authority $500 for tax year 2013, and $2,000 \nfor tax year 2015, and she is waiting for the state to contact her about a payment plan. \n(Tr. 60; AE DD) \n \nApplicant said that she did not know her federal income tax returns were not filed \nbecause her husband had filed them in the previous years. (Tr. 53-56) He used Turbotax, \nwhich is a computer and Internet-based system that does not require a taxpayer\u2019s \nsignature to file tax returns. (Tr. 73-74) She said she discovered her tax returns were not \nfiled when a state tax entity contacted her about her tax return for tax year 2011, and she \nsuggested this discovery occurred in 2016 or 2017 possibly in July or August 2017. (Tr. \n54-56, 74) She did not explain why she believed from 2012 to 2016 or 2017 that her \nhusband, who was suffering from mental health issues and who failed to file a state tax \nreturn around 2012 or had filed an incorrect state tax return, could be entrusted with filing \nher tax returns. \n \nAfter Applicant received the letter from the state tax entity about not filing a state \ntax return, she went to an IRS office in August 2017, and asked which federal tax returns \nwere not filed. (Tr. 54-55; GE 1) The IRS informed her that her federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2011, 2013, and 2015 were not filed. (Tr. 56)  \n \nApplicant said she spent the next two years gathering information to file her tax \nreturns for tax years 2011, 2013, and 2015. (Tr. 57) She said, \u201cthe federal transfers given \nto me at the IRS office [did] not include the state numbers. And [she] had to track down \n[her] W-2 forms for 2015. The company had been sold. And due to COVID they couldn\u2019t \n[give her] the tax, the W-2 form until recently.\u201d (Tr. 59) When she delivered the tax returns \nto the IRS, the IRS stamped them indicating the IRS received them. (AE B)  \n \nThe lack of W-2s does not excuse a failure to timely file a tax return. When a \ntaxpayer lacks documentation, such as a W-2, the correct approach is to contact the IRS \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nseeking help to obtain a W-2, and in any event, a tax return should be timely filed with an \nestimate of income and taxes withheld. See IRS website, Form W-2 Missing? IRS Can \nHelp, available at https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/form-w-2-missing-irs-can-help.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant timely filed her federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, \n2016, 2017, and 2018. (Tr. 50; AE A; AE B) She filed federal income her tax returns late \nfor tax years 2011, 2013, and 2015. She paid her federal income tax debt down from \n$31,000 to about $14,000 through monthly tax payments in accordance with her IRS \nsettlement agreement and through IRS transfers of refunds for tax years 2016, 2017, and \n2018. (Tr. 57-58) In October 2020, she filed her state income tax returns for tax years \n2013 and 2015, and she owes the state about $2,500.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant has a past-due debt for $1,646, and the total debt is \n$7,742. She made consistent payments for several years; however, a credit card was \ncompromised, and this caused a break in payments for several months. (Tr. 62) On \nOctober 19, 2019, the creditor indicated the amount of her debt was $7,281, and the next \n$155 payment was due on November 15, 2019. (AE H) She made five $155 monthly \npayments from June to October 2019. (AE H) From October 2019 to October 2020, she \nmade eleven $155 payments. (Tr. 31, 62; AE EE; AE FF) The creditor indicated her \naccount is \u201ccurrently on-time.\u201d (AE I)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a medical account placed for collection for $1,556. In October \n2020, Applicant made her first payment on her $35 monthly payment plan. (Tr. 31, 62; \nAE GG)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a charged-off account for $792. In November 2020, Applicant \nestablished a $25 monthly payment plan for this account, and she made the first payment. \n(Tr. 32-33, 62; AE J; AE HH)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i allege accounts placed for collection for $449 and $386 owed \nto the same creditor. Applicant mistakenly thought these debts were paid. (Tr. 64) Once \nshe realized they were delinquent, she paid them in full in 2019. (Tr. 33, 64-65; AE L; AE \nJJ) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges a charged-off department store account for $303. Applicant \nattempted to pay the debt; however, the creditor would not accept payment because it \nwas beyond the statute of limitations. (Tr. 33-34, 65)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges an insurance account placed for collection for $300. On an \nunspecified date, Applicant established a $50 monthly payment plan with the creditor. (Tr. \n34, 65; AE II)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a medical account placed for collection for $2,482. Applicant has \na payment plan with the creditor, and she made the first two payments. (Tr. 34-35, 66)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges a utility account placed for collection for $559. Applicant has a \npayment plan with the creditor, and she made the first payment. (Tr. 35; AE JJ) \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nApplicant received financial counseling, and she provided a budget. (Tr. 71; AE \nAA; AE QQ) Her annual gross salary is $119,000, and she receives an additional $5,000 \nannually from her part-time employment. (AE QQ) Her monthly net remainder is $468. \n(Id.) Applicant does not use credit cards. (Tr. 68) She is unsure of the status of some of \nher family\u2019s recent medical bills. (Tr. 68) \n \nCharacter Evidence  \n \nCoworkers, supervisors, and friends described Applicant in positive terms. (AE Q; \nAE R; AE CC) The general sense of their statements is that she is intelligent, innovative, \nprofessional, detail oriented, helpful, honest, reliable, conscientious, and trustworthy. (AE \nQ; AE R; AE CC) She has an exceptionally strong reputation as a diligent and dedicated \nemployee. (AE Q; AE R; AE CC) Her positive work attributes contributed to the success \nof the enterprises where she is employed. (AE Q; AE R; AE CC) There is no evidence of \nsecurity violations or criminal conduct. \n \nIn 2009, Applicant received a Society of Logistics Award and a certificate of \nappreciation from the Department of Labor for her contributions to a data collection \nprogram. (AE O; AE S) Her performance review for 2019 showed good to excellent \nevaluations. (AE P) She received additional awards for her contributions to her employer, \nthe Boy Scouts, and the Army. (AE S) In 2019, she received an $800 performance award \nand a 1.8 percent pay increase. (AE S) She contributed to her community as a paramedic \nfrom 1995 to 2001, to the fire department, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Junior Miss, a \nrecreation center, her church, and various volunteer and youth activities. (AE BB at 4-5) \n \nRequest for Evidence \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I asked Applicant to provide additional \ndocumentation: \n \nAnd ma\u2019am if you can find those letters where you were first notified, I need \nto make a timeline in this case of when you discovered the tax returns were \nnot filed. And then what you did about those tax returns. Because the filing \nof the tax returns is the key determinant in this case, because of the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. So, I have to look very carefully at whether you acted \nresponsibly in connection with filing those tax returns. . . . [I have to \ndetermine] were you responsible when you filed those tax returns, after you \ndiscovered they were not filed? So, I have to nail that down. (Tr. 87-88) \n \nApplicant did not provide the letter or letters of notification she received about her not \nfiling tax returns. She did not provide the IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2011, 2013, and \n2015, which may have contained information about the IRS attempts to notify her about \nthe missing tax returns. She provided a statement from her husband; however, he did not \nadmit that he was responsible for filing Applicant\u2019s tax returns or that he misled her about \nfiling tax returns. (AE MM) She did not ask for additional time to seek additional \ndocumentation. \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nApplicant\u2019s son and daughter were hospitalized several times for depression, \nanxiety, and/or other mental health issues. More recently, her son was unable to work \nbecause he injured his knee. Her husband had mental-health problems over the last ten \nyears, which required inpatient and outpatient treatments and affected his ability and \nwillingness to support his family. Applicant had disruptions in her income from changes \nin her employment and her tenant\u2019s failures to pay rent. She is a generous person who \nvolunteered to help others including allowing another family facing financial hardship to \nmove in with her family. She allowed her mother to move in with her after her mother\u2019s \nhusband died. These medical problems and spousal issues are circumstances beyond \nher control that adversely affected her finances.   \n \nApplicant has taken important steps towards establishing her financial \nresponsibility. She filed all required tax returns and made substantial progress addressing \nher debts. The SOR alleges 10 delinquent debts totaling $45,803. She paid the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i. The creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.j waived collection of her debt because of \nthe statute of limitations. She has an established payment plan for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nShe reduced her federal tax debt from $31,324 to about $14,000. She has started \npayment plans on the other SOR debts. Her unpaid state tax debt of $2,500 is relatively \nmodest. She received financial counseling, and has a budget that she follows. She has \nsufficient financial resources to establish and maintain her financial responsibility. These \ncircumstances establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) for \nall of her debts, including her tax debts. These five mitigating conditions do not mitigate \nsecurity concerns caused by her failure to timely file her federal and state income tax \nreturns. \n \nThe critical financial considerations issue is Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her \nstate and federal income tax returns. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and \nfile with the IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal \noffense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, \nreads:  \n \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \n  \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th \nCir. 1931). Failure to file a state tax return may also be a crime under state law. For \npurposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her federal \nand state income tax returns against her as crimes. In regard to the failure to timely file \nfederal and state income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \n \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 14-\n05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. \n20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to \nan applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information must nevertheless be denied. In ISCR Case No. \n15-1031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return \nin December 2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal \ntax return in October 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each \nyear. Nevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to \ngrant access to classified information. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \n \nIn this case, Applicant provided evidence of mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(g) \nbecause she received financial counseling, generated a budget, filed her tax returns, \nestablished payment plans with the IRS, and plans a payment plan with the state tax \nauthority. Her history of compliance with her IRS payment plan shows she some reform \ngoing forward. However, there is insufficient evidence showing Applicant\u2019s multiple \nfailures to timely file her tax returns were prudent good-faith decisions. She did not \nestablish she was unable to make greater progress sooner filing her federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2011, 2013, and 2015, and her state income tax returns for tax years \n2013 and 2015. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old systems engineer. Her current annual income from her \nsystems engineer employment is $119,000. She has worked as a systems engineer since \n2014. She also has part-time employment working in a drug store as a cashier, where her \nannual income is about $5,000. She has held a security clearance since 1998. In 1997, \nshe earned an associate\u2019s degree in emergency medical services. In 2001, she received \na bachelor\u2019s degree. In 2012, she received a master\u2019s degree in technology management \nand homeland security. Applicant\u2019s coworkers, supervisors, and friends lauded \nApplicant\u2019s performance and trustworthiness. The general sense of their statements is \nthat she is intelligent, innovative, professional, detail oriented, helpful, honest, reliable, \nconscientious, and trustworthy. She has an exceptionally strong reputation as a diligent \n\n \n15 \n                                         \n \nand dedicated employee. She received awards for her work performance. She \ncontributed to the success of the enterprises where she is employed. Applicant\u2019s support \nto her family, employer, friends, and community are positive attributes that warrant \nconsiderable mitigating weight.  \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected \nof someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax \nreturns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed \na grant of a security clearance for a retired Navy E-9 and cited his failure to timely file \nstate tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal tax returns for tax years \n2010 through 2012. Before the retired E-9\u2019s hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his \ntax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal \nBoard highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax \nexpenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and \nexpenses, and spouse\u2019s serious medical and mental health problems. The Appeal Board \nemphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, \nit is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem \nwith complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d \nId. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation \nmarks and brackets omitted)). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. \n9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal \ngovernment, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal \nGovernment for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other \nobligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d).  \n \nThe Appeal Board reversed the favorable decision of the administrative judge in a \ncase where the applicant filed his 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax returns in February 2014 and \nhis 2012 tax return in August 2015 all before the SOR was issued. ISCR Case No. 15-\n03481 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). The applicant owed less than $1,800 in federal \nincome taxes for those four tax years at the time of the decision. Id. The Appeal Board \nfound the timing of the filing of his tax returns to be important stating: \n \n\n \n16 \n                                         \n \nApplicant did not resolve his tax filing delinquencies until after submission \nof his security clearance application and after undergoing his background \ninterview. Taking action to resolve the delinquent tax filings well after the \ninitiation of the security clearance process undercuts a determination that \nthose actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquencies. Id. \nat 5. \n \nApplicant filed all of her tax returns and made substantial progress paying her \ndebts. Her remaining tax debt is relatively low in comparison to her income. However, the \nprimary problem here relates to the timing of Applicant\u2019s filing of her federal and state \nincome tax returns. She may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance of \nthis requirement in the context of his eligibility for access to classified information. When \nthe OPM investigator questioned her in 2017, she said she was going to collect the \ndocumentation and file her tax returns. She did not file her federal income tax returns for \n2011, 2013, and 2015 until June 27, 2019, after she completed her SCA and had her \nOPM interview. She did not file her state tax returns for 2013 and 2015 until October 2020. \nShe did not establish she was unable to make greater progress sooner in the resolution \nof her tax issues. Her actions under the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too little, too late \nto fully mitigate security concerns. See ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, \n2016). Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her tax returns \u201cmay indicate poor self-control, lack \nof judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about [her] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 18. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Unmitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance \nto Applicant is not warranted at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a: \n \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \n                                         \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On \nMarch 18, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Department\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 13, was \nprovided to Applicant, who received the file on April 2, 2021. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.

Applicant stated \nthat most of his financial problems were connected to his divorce in 2013. (Answer; Item \n3; Applicant Exhibit A.) \nThe current status of the allegations in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed the Federal Government through the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) $20,405 for unpaid taxes. Applicant and his wife were divorced in \n2013. As part of the divorce agreement Applicant was required to liquidate an IRA and \npay his ex-wife half. He provided $18,000 to his ex-wife and used other monies for \npersonal expenses.

The last one, dated April 15, 2021, is for $200. \nApplicant had not received notification from the IRS that they have accepted his proposal \nas of the date of Applicant Exhibit A. Applicant is making a good-faith effort to resolve this \ndebt. (Item 3 at 2, 7-9, 22; Item 10 at 16-17; Applicant Exhibit A at 2-4, 23-27.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted that he had a mortgage foreclosed on in 2014 in the amount \nof $136,500. Applicant bought the subject house with his then-wife. After the divorce he \ncould not maintain the payments on one salary and attempted to refinance or sell the \nproperty. He was unsuccessful and lost the house in foreclosure. (Item 3 at 10-11, \nApplicant Exhibit A at 3-4.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he had a second mortgage charged off in \napproximately 2014 in the amount of $34,743. This was in relation to the first mortgage \ndiscussed in 1.b, above. Applicant stated that his ex-wife refused to help pay any debt. \nHe stated in his Answer, \u201cI was financially uncapable (sic) of paying on my own salary. I \ndid have lawyers fees and child support that were present at the time as well.\u201d (Item 3 at \n10-11; Applicant Exhibit A at 3-4.) \n1.d.

He stated in his Answer that he \nis amenable to paying this debt, but there is no evidence that he has entered into any \npayment arrangement with this creditor. This debt is not resolved. \n1.e. Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off commercial debt in the amount \nof $1,032. This credit card debt arose during his marriage. He stated in his Answer that \nhis ex-wife was responsible for the debt, but she refused to pay it. He is amenable to \npaying this debt, but there is no evidence that he has entered into any payment \narrangement with this creditor. This debt is not resolved. \n1.f. Applicant denied owing a charged-off credit card debt in the amount of $471. \nHe stated in his Answer that he paid this debt. This debt does not appear in the most \nrecent credit report in the record, dated March 16, 2021. (Item 9.) Based on the available \ninformation, I cannot find that Applicant currently owes this debt. This allegation is found \nfor Applicant. \n1.g. Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off wireless telephone debt in the \namount of $207. This debt arose during his marriage. He stated in his Answer that his ex-\nwife was responsible for the debt, but she refuses to pay it.

Applicant denied that he had a foreclosure in about July 2016. Applicant stated \nthat the person involved in this foreclosure is his father, who has the same name but a \ndifferent Social Security number. Documentation in the record confirms that the property \ninvolved in this foreclosure actually belonged to Applicant\u2019s father and his wife. (Item 11; \nItem 12; Applicant Exhibit A at 6-7.) This allegation is found for Applicant because the \ndebt is not his. \nThree credit reports were submitted by the Government (Items 7, 8, and 9). The \ncredit reports show that Applicant\u2019s financial condition is good other than the debts in the \nSOR. Applicant has stated that he is current with his payments to the IRS and his child \nsupport. (Applicant Exhibit A at 3-4.) His tax return documentation shows that his salary \nhas been steadily increasing over the years he has been employed with his current \nemployer. (Item 10.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in criminal conduct that creates doubt about a person\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted both allegations under this \nparagraph. \n \n2.a. Applicant was arrested in March 2014 and charged with seven offenses \nrelated to his driving under the influence of alcohol. He plead guilty to Driving Under the \nInfluence of Liquor/Drugs/Vapors and was sentenced to five days\u2019 confinement, \nunsupervised probation for one year, fined $2,300, and required to attend alcohol \nawareness classes. Applicant submitted evidence showing that he had completely paid \nhis fine and successfully completed the classes for this offense. Applicant was fired from \nhis job with his state\u2019s Department of Corrections due to this arrest and conviction. (Item \n3 at 13-14, 21; Item 5; Applicant Exhibit A at 4, 12, 13, 15, 18, 20, and 21.) \n \n2.b. Applicant was arrested in July 2016 and charged with four offenses related to \nhis driving under the influence of alcohol. He plead guilty to Driving Under the Influence \nof Liquor/Drugs/Vapors and was sentenced to confinement for one day, 90 days of home \nconfinement, unsupervised probation for two years, fined $3,475, 30 hours of community \nservice, and required to attend 24 sessions of substance abuse treatment. Applicant \nsubmitted evidence showing that he had completely paid his fine, and successfully \ncompleted the required treatment sessions for this offense as well as his community \nservice. (Item 3 at 19-20, 28; Item 6; Applicant Exhibit A at 5, 11, 14, 16, 17, and 19.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he consumes intoxicants to excess. Subparagraph 3.a stated that the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation set forth under subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b, above, are also cognizable under \nthis paragraph.

He has consistently stated that he has not drunk alcohol since his last arrest \nin July 2016, a period of more than five years. In addition to the court-ordered counseling \nin regard to his two DUI arrests, he has also obtained counseling through his employer\u2019s \nemployee assistance program. That counselor submitted a letter to Applicant\u2019s attorney \non September 9, 2016. He stated that Applicant \u201chas never denied his alcohol use and \ncomes with a positive attitude.\u201d The counselor also stated, \u201cHe [Applicant] has made \nexcellent progress in acquiring personal insights and better ways to cope with stress in \nhis life.\u201d (Item 3 at 4-6, 9, 14; Applicant Exhibit A at 9.) \n Paragraph 4 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. Applicant \ndenied both allegations under this paragraph. \nIn January 1991, when Applicant was 15 years old, he was charged with \nconspiracy to transport marijuana. He got involved in a conspiracy with two other juveniles \nand one adult. Applicant was charged because he did not inform police of the plot. He \nplead guilty as a juvenile and received one-year probation, which he successfully \ncompleted. The record is silent as to whether this conviction occurred in Federal or state \ncourt. The only evidence as to the existence of this conviction is that provided by Applicant \nin his interview and written statements. (Item 3 at 20-21.) \nApplicant did not admit this arrest and conviction on his September 2015 e-QIP \n(SOR 4.a) or when questioned by an authorized investigator of the Department of \nDefense in June 2017 (SOR 4.b). He only discussed the conspiracy charge with the \ninvestigator in 2017 after an initial denial. \n \n \nIn his Answer Applicant said with regard to allegation 4.a, \u201cI believe I\nmisunderstood if i had to mention anything about charges as a minor or under the age of\n18.

(Applicant Exhibit A at 5.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had two mortgages foreclosed upon in approximately 2014. He owed \napproximately $24,500 to the IRS for back taxes and penalties. In addition, he owed three \nother creditors approximately $10,891 for past-due debts as of the date the SOR was \nissued. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAll the debts alleged in the SOR, including the tax debt, were related to Applicant\u2019s \ndivorce from his wife in 2013. He could not afford to pay the mortgages on his salary, so \nthe house went into foreclosure. He had to liquidate a retirement account, with the \nsubsequent tax debt, and the consumer debts arose during the marriage. Considering \nthose basic facts, we turn to the question of whether Applicant has acted responsibly in \nresolving the debts, even though he has not paid any of the consumer debts as of yet. I \nfind that he has. Applicant has been paying the IRS $285 a month for well over a year, \nan amount of over $4,000. He also has consistently been making his child-support \npayments. The credit reports show no new past-due indebtedness. His tax returns show \na steadily increasing salary, which will allow him to continue to pay the IRS, his child \nsupport obligation, and resolve the consumer debts in a responsible fashion. All four of \nthe mitigating conditions have application in this case.   \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payments of such debts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted).  \n \nGiven his resources, Applicant has initiated a pragmatic approach to the \nrepayment of his IRS debt and has taken significant steps to resolve that debt. Applicant \nhas the knowledge and ability that will allow him to resolve his other debts and stay on a \nproper financial footing. He has fully mitigated all the allegations in the SOR. Paragraph \n1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for criminal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, which states: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant had two alcohol-related arrests in convictions in 2014 and 2016. Both of \nthe above disqualifying conditions have application in this case. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct. Two have possible application \nto the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last arrest occurred in 2016, five years ago. There is no evidence of \nany further criminal conduct. He submitted considerable documentary evidence showing \nthat he attended all required classes and treatment sessions.

In addition to court-ordered education and treatment, he used \nhis company\u2019s employee assistance program to obtain additional counseling about \nalcohol and how to avoid such incidents in the future. The conduct is unlikely to \nrecur given what he has learned and the resources he has available.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information, or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin or making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nApplicant was arrested and subsequently convicted of conspiracy to transport \nmarijuana when he was a juvenile. He did not report these facts on his e-QIP or when \noriginally interviewed by a government investigator. The above disqualifying condition has \napplication to this case. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant was told by his lawyers in 1991 that his drug case would be expunged \nwhen he turned 18. After being informed by the investigator of the need to discuss the \noffense Applicant cooperated. With regard to the e-QIP it is clear that Applicant looked \nfor an instruction saying he had to report juvenile offenses. He did not find it. Applicant\u2019s \nbelief that he did not have to report the arrest, while erroneous, was not an attempt to \nconceal the arrest. Given that Applicant was otherwise truthful regarding more current \ncriminal offenses I find that he did not have the requisite intent to deceive when he filled \nout the e-QIP or originally denied the offense to the investigator. Paragraph 4 is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerns regarding his financial situation, past alcohol use and related criminal conduct, \nand his alleged falsification. He has minimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or \nduress, as well as the likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record evidence does not \ncreate substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4: Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a and 4.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 9, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign \ninfluence) and F (financial considerations). Applicant responded to the SOR on August \n29, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to another administrative judge on March 10, 2020. The case was delayed \nbecause of COVID-19 and Applicant working overseas. The case was reassigned to me \non May 24, 2021. The hearing was convened as scheduled on June 17, 2021. \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 3 through 5 were admitted in evidence over \nApplicant\u2019s objection. Applicant\u2019s objection to GE 2 was partially sustained and partially \noverruled.

Post-hearing, Applicant submitted documents \nthat I have marked AE E through H, and admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Egypt. Over Applicant\u2019s objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not \nbe repeated verbatim. I have also taken administrative notice of facts about Egypt from \nthe U.S. Department of State website. Of note is that Egypt is a republic governed by an \nelected president and unicameral legislature. The United States and Egypt share a \nstrong partnership based on mutual interest in Middle East peace and stability, \neconomic opportunity, and regional security. Promoting a stable, prosperous Egypt, \nwhere the government protects the basic rights of its citizens and fulfills the aspirations \nof the Egyptian people, will continue to be a core objective of U.S. policy. I also note the \nsignificant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in Egypt. \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant was born in Egypt. He immigrated to the United States in 1992, and he \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2008. Most of his Egyptian family moved to the United States, \nincluding his brother who retired from the U.S. military and his widowed mother who \nlives with him. He has a half-brother who is a citizen and resident of Egypt. Applicant is \nnot close to his half-brother, and has not seen him in years. His mother used to own an \napartment in Egypt, valued at about $33,200, which she used when she visited Egypt, \nbut she sold the property. Applicant proclaimed his undivided allegiance to the United \nStates: \u201cAmerica is my country.\u201d (Tr. at 20-21; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant invested in a permit (medallion) for a taxicab in a major U.S. city in \nabout 2007. The cost of the medallion was paid through a down payment of about \n$32,000, and a secured loan, with monthly payments of more than $2,000.

The predatory lending \npractices associated with the loans for the medallions became the subject of a federal \ninvestigation. Applicant moved to another state in 2013 for a fresh start. (Tr. at 22, 35-\n36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A) \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He \nworked for the company overseas, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, he was \nunable to return after a visit home. He will be rehired if he receives a security clearance. \nHe is applying for a security clearance for the first time. He has a master\u2019s degree. He is \nmarried with two children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 34; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges 23 delinquent debts with balances totaling about $39,000, and \na $3,849 judgment that was awarded in 2011. Almost all of the debts became \ndelinquent before 2013. Applicant admitted that he owed all of the debts at one point. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nHe paid in full the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($1,136) and 1.b ($500), with a final payment of \n$232 in October 2020. He also settled and paid the $439 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, with a final \npayment in July 2019. He stated that he paid the $709 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l. He did not \nprovide documentation of the payment, but the March 2020 credit report lists an account \nwith the original creditor as paid and closed, with a $0 balance. (Tr. at 29, 32; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-5; AE B, D) \nApplicant attempted to contact a number of the creditors for the debts alleged in \nthe SOR, but they were nonresponsive. The debts were reported on a June 2017 credit \nreport, but none of the debts are listed on any credit report after that. Applicant\u2019s current \ncredit reports show no delinquent debts. Several of the creditors have issued him new \ncredit. Applicant\u2019s current finances are stable, with no new delinquent debts accrued in \nyears.

He was \nunable to return after a visit home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He submitted \ndocuments and letters attesting to his outstanding service and remarkable \nprofessionalism.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s half-brother is a citizen and resident of Egypt. The United States and \nEgypt share a strong partnership based on mutual interest in Middle East peace and \nstability, economic opportunity, and regional security. Egypt also has ongoing human \nrights problems, and there is a significant threat of terrorism. Applicant\u2019s connection to \nhis half-brother creates a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) \nhave been raised by the evidence. \nAny security concerns raised by the apartment in Egypt ended when Applicant\u2019s \nmother sold the apartment. SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. He has been in the United States for decades. \nHis mother lives with him; his brother served in the U.S. military; and Applicant served \noverseas in support of the U.S. military. He is not close to his half-brother, and he has \nnot seen him in years. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Egypt are outweighed by his deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. It is unlikely he will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests \nof Egypt. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable. AG \n\u00b6 8(c) is partially applicable. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had financial problems, including delinquent debts and an unpaid \njudgment. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; and \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant bought a taxicab medallion in about 2007, in what essentially became a \n\u201cbubble.\u201d The city changed the way it regulated taxicabs; Applicant\u2019s business was \nunsuccessful; and the \u201cbubble\u201d burst; leaving Applicant with a medallion at a fraction of \nwhat he paid for it and numerous debts that he incurred attempting to keep his taxi \nbusiness afloat. Almost all of the debts alleged in the SOR became delinquent before \nApplicant moved on from the taxi business in 2013. \nApplicant paid or settled at least three debts. He attempted to contact a number \nof the creditors for the debts, but they were nonresponsive. None of the debts are listed \non any credit report after 2017. Applicant\u2019s current finances are stable, with no new \ndelinquent debt accrued in years. \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation. Delinquent debts are a \ncontinuing concern until they are resolved. However, at some point, debts become old, \nunenforceable, charged off, fall off credit reports, and are no longer of interest even to \nthe creditors. I find that Applicant finances do not cast doubt about his current judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Security concerns \nabout his finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s work overseas in support of the U.S. military. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence and financial considerations security concerns.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.x: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

There is no documentary evidence of any action \ntaken on the SOR 1.a debt between January 2015 and September 2019, when \nApplicant began making payments under the Chapter 13 payment plan. While the \nbudgetary documents furnish income and expense information for September 2019, the \ninformation is over a year old with no indication of debt repayments. Eligibility for \nsecurity clearance access is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 30, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the \naffirmative findings required to continue a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 20, 2019, detailing security concerns raised \nby financial considerations (Guideline F).

The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 11, 2020, for a \nhearing on September 25, 2020. The hearing was held as scheduled. The \nGovernment\u2019s six exhibits (GE) 1-6 and Applicant\u2019s nine exhibits (AE) A-I were entered \ninto evidence without objection. On September 30, 2020, Applicant submitted four post-\nhearing exhibits (AE J-M). Without objection, the four post-hearing exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 7, 2020. The \nrecord closed on October 7, 2020. \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \nAt the hearing during an examination of AE D, it was discovered that Applicant \nowes taxes for 2017 to the state and federal tax agencies because of the loss of an \nincome deduction for his mortgage and his property taxes. (AE D (Chapter 13 Plan, \namended at 2) Applicant is paying the posted tax balances through the Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding two additional \nallegations: \n1.c \u2013 You are indebted to the State of Maryland in the  amount of $1,426 for back \ntaxes for tax year 2017. \n1.d \u2013 You are indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the amount of \n$7,667 for back taxes for tax year 2017.  \nApplicant\u2019s attorney did not oppose the amendment, noting that Applicant \nadmitted the tax debts and was paying them through the pending Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR (filed with the court on \nSeptember 25, 2020) was granted. (Tr. 72-73) The motion is admitted into evidence as \nGE 7. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR allegations identify two past due mortgage accounts under the financial \nconsiderations guideline.

(GE 1 at 20-21) He has held a security \nclearance since April 1985. (GE 1 at 38-39) \nApplicant purchased a home in 1999. The mortgage company identified in SOR \n1.a assumed the mortgage from another mortgage company in 2007. Applicant\u2019s last \npayment on the mortgage was in January 2015.  \n(GE 5 at 1) SOR 1.b is a home \nequity loan Applicant opened in September 2008. He used part of the second loan to \nfinance repairs he made on his home between 2009 and 2014. He used the other \nportion of the loan to pay for a student loan and income taxes for tax year 2007. The \nlast payment made on the home equity loan was in October 2017. (GE 5 at 1) \nApplicant claims that when he moved into the home in 1999, it was habitable. \nHowever, between 2009 and 2014, the house developed structural problems. There \nwere too many layers of roofing atop the home by 2014. The basement leaked, and the \nair conditioning went out at some time that cannot be determined from the record. The \ngutters needed to be repaired or replaced. (Tr. 13-17, 45) Applicant claimed there was \nalways some part of the house to repair. Notwithstanding the structural problems with \nthe house, he continued making the mortgage and loan payments, though they were not \nalways timely. There is no evidence that he continued to make mortgage payments after \nJanuary 2015 and until he negotiated a short-sale with the SOR mortgage company in \nNovember 2016. As noted earlier, there was no additional payment activity after \nJanuary 2015. (GE 2 at 4, 15) \nIn addition to the cost of fixing his house, Applicant indicated that his younger \nbrother and oldest son caused him financial problems. For about six to eight months in \n2015, Applicant\u2019s brother had no job or money and Applicant paid all living and \ntransportation expenses for his brother\u2019s family living in two locations. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant\u2019s oldest son had medical problems since his youth.

(AE B, D, F) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are flexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied together with common sense and the general factors of the whole-person \nconcept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires \nthat \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \n18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial \ndistress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \n19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nWhen the SOR was issued in September 2016, Applicant owed $81,737 in \ndelinquent debt to five creditors. About 94% of the debt are two federal tax liens. The \nliens, which are posted in the government\u2019s 2015 and 2016 credit reports, Indicate that \nthe federal liens were filed in  October 2008 and June 2010.1  The state liens were filed \nin December 2008 and May 2011. Except for documentation that indicates he made a \n$200 payment to the SOR 1.f credit card creditor on October 2, 2017, the other four \nliens are still unresolved, demonstrating a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), 19(f) apply. \n20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n1  Adverse information from credit reports can normally meet the substantial evidence standard \nand Government\u2019s obligations under E3.1.14. See, e.g. , ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015); 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThough Applicant\u2019s most recent debt became delinquent more than five years \nago in 2012, all the liens and almost the entire debt to the SOR 1.f creditor remain \nunpaid. Due to the large amount of federal tax debt, it is likely that the debts will \ncontinue into the future. Applicant\u2019s inaction after learning in 2015 about the liens and \ndelinquent debts raises ongoing questions about his trustworthiness and judgment. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s three-month period of unemployment in 2011 is a circumstance \nrecognized under AG \u00b6 20(b). However, he has been steadily employed for the last six \nyears without any work-related disruption or any other unanticipated event. When he \nlearned about his delinquent debts in 2015, he did not act responsibly to address his \ndelinquent debts. Applicant receives no mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant receives no mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) because his only financial \ncounseling occurred in 1996. While he claimed he was enrolled for future financial \ncounseling, he provided no documentation of participation and there are no clear \nindications his financial problems are resolved or under control.  I draw the same \nconclusion under AG \u00b6 20(d) as the evidence is devoid of any good-faith efforts by \nApplicant to repay his delinquent debts. The fact that Applicant no longer owes the SOR \n1.e creditor is not the result of a record of good-faith payments to resolve the debt, but \nthe creditor\u2019s decision to terminate additional collection efforts.  \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because there is no evidence corroborating Applicant\u2019s bald \nclaim that he does not owe the federal tax liens and the one state tax claim in SOR 1.d. \nThe mitigation due Applicant under AG \u00b6 20(g) for his documented action to address the \nstate tax lien in SOR 1.c must be weighed against the fact that the action was taken one \nday before the hearing, even though he was aware of the lien in 2015. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the nine \ngeneral factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nclassified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is married and has two stepchildren and a son from a previous marriage. His \nDD 214 shows that he received several awards and commendations for his honorable \nservice in the U.S. Marine Corps between 1996 and 2003. His current supervisor \npraised Applicant\u2019s job performance for the period between April and December 31, \n2016. \nWeighing against the favorable evidence is the disqualifying evidence of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts that he accrued between October 2008 and July 2012. He was placed \non notice during his PSI in 2015 that he had these federal and state tax liens, and credit \ncard debts. Though he claimed he made follow-up phone calls to the IRS and his CPA \nshortly after the interview in 2015, he also acknowledged that he did not believe he \nowed the debts and that he neglected the debts. He received additional notice upon \nissuance of the SOR in September 2016, and he responded in November 2016 that he \nwas researching the liens with his CPA. He conceded at the October 2017 hearing that \nhe had done very little to resolve his debts since he submitted his November 2016 \nanswer to the SOR. The documented $200 payment to the SOR 1.f creditor and the \npromise to pay the SOR 1.c creditor on the day before the hearing substantiates his \nobservation. Viewing the evidence from an overall standpoint, Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the guideline for financial considerations. \nHe has sufficiently mitigated the adverse evidence under the personal conduct \nguideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Berry, Esq. \n04/22/2021 \nDecision \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations and criminal conduct security concerns, but \nfailed to mitigate the personal conduct and drug involvement security concerns. Clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement, Guideline J, criminal conduct, Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The DOD CAF took, the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn November 17, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR allegations, admitting all of the allegations,except \nsubparagraphs 1(b) and 2(b), and requesting a hearing. On March 16, \n \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2020, Applicant filed a supplemental answer to the SOR. The case was assigned to me on January 22, 2021. On \nFebruary 5, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, scheduling the case for \nFebruary 23, 2021.  \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. I incorporated 11 government exhibits into the record, marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 11, and I incorporated 12 Applicant exhibits (AE), incorporated into the \nrecord as AE A through AE L. In addition, I received the testimony of Applicant and three character witnesses. The \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on March 8, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 50-year-old single man. He graduated from college in 1993, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nbusiness administration, and he earned a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 2003.  \nApplicant is the owner and chief executive officer of a company that provides contract services to federal \ngovernment clients. (Tr. 49; AE C) When he started the company in 2008, he was the only employee. By 2019, \nthe company employed 115 people. In 2020, the company\u2019s annual gross revenue totaled approximately $19.7 million \ndollars. (Tr. 49) According to the company\u2019s chief operating officer, who has worked for Applicant for the last three \nyears and known him for 16 years, Applicant is a well-respected individual who excels in his work. (Tr. 24) \nApplicant is a humanitarian who donates significant company resources to charities, targeting youth who are \neither underprivileged, or underrepresented in certain professional fields, and families with food insecurity. (Tr. 78) \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 2008. \nApplicant used marijuana from 2016 to approximately June 2019. (Answer at 5) He consumed it in cookie or \nbrownie form. He began using it to reassure a friend who had been prescribed it to control pain related to multiple \nsclerosis and was hesitant to use it. In an effort to reassure her, Applicant told her that \u201c[he would] try it with \n[her].\u201d (Tr. 53) Subsequently, Applicant \u201cused it to relax and get a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d approximately once per month \nin social settings and on vacations. (GE 1 at 41; GE 3 at 8; Supplemental Answer at 4)  \nWhen Applicant disclosed his marijuana use on his 2018 security clearance application, he noted that \nhe \u201cmight\u201d use it again in the future. (GE 1 at 41) As time elapsed, his intention to continue using marijuana \nbecame more definitive. Specifically, in his subject interview he stated that he was likely to use it again, and in \nresponse to interrogatories, completed in June 2019, he answered \u201cY\u201d in response to the question, \u201c[d]o you intend to \nuse this drug in the future?.\u201d (GE 2 at 3) \nApplicant no longer uses marijuana. It is unclear from the record when Applicant stopped using marijuana. In \nhis Supplemental Answer of March 2020, he stated that he had not consumed marijuana since January 2019. \n(Supplemental Answer at 15) Earlier, in his response to interrogatories completed in June 2019, he noted that he \nused marijuana on \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\u201cvarious dates throughout the year,\u201d and intended to smoke it in the future. (GE 2 at 3), Applicant testified that he \n\u201cwas not fully as present as [he] should have been\u201d when disclosing the dates of his marijuana usage. (Tr. 88)   \nApplicant executed an affidavit in November 2019 stating his intention never to use marijuana again. \n(Supplemental Answer at 39) In February 2021, he executed an affidavit stating that he had complied with the \nprevious affidavit and reiterated his intent not to use marijuana in the future. (AE A) \nApplicant used marijuana under \u201cthe wrongful impression that [he] could use [it while] holding a clearance so \nlong as the state laws provided for legal use, despite the fact that marijuana usage is still prohibited under federal \nlaw.\u201d (Supplemental Answer at 17) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that his marijuana use stemmed from \n\u201cignorance of not understanding the gravity of holding on to a clearance . . . .\u201d (Tr. 52) Currently, he is attending \neducation programs, and disassociating himself from social events where marijuana use occurs. (Supplemental \nAnswer at 15) \nIn January 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving/attempting to drive under the influence of \nalcohol (DUI), after pulling over to the side of the road to go to sleep upon leaving a night club. (Answer, Enclosure 3 \nat 6 - 7) He was sentenced to one year of probation, a monetary fine, and 30 days of jail time, suspended. \nApplicant now takes a cab or an Uber home if he drinks alcohol during social outings. (Tr. 68) He has had \nno alcohol-related incidents since the 2014 arrest.  \nApplicant failed to report his DUI arrest to his facility security office, as required by the National Industrial \nSecurity Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), Chapter 1, Section 3, paragraph 1-300. Also, he did not report his \nmarijuana use to his facility security office, as required. When Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, he was \nserving as the facility security officer (FSO) of his company. Unaware of the process of reporting oneself on the JPAS \nsystem, he decided to wait until the next Defense Security Services audit to disclose the adverse information. (Tr. \n62-64) There is no record evidence that he made such a disclosure. Moreover, contrary to Applicant\u2019s testimony that \nhe disclosed the 2014 DUI arrest on his 2018 security clearance application, he did not actually disclose it until his \ninvestigative interview in October 2018. (GE 1; GE 2 at 20) \nAs Applicant\u2019s company continued to grow, he began to recognize how untenable it was for him to balance his \nCEO managerial responsibilities with the security maintenance and oversight responsibilities of an FSO. \nConsequently, in 2020, he hired an FSO. (Tr. 61; AE B) The FSO developed a security compliance program and \ninstalled an intranet. Also, the FSO tracks the requisite trainings for employees to complete, and he publishes a \nmonthly security newsletter for the company. (Tr. 62-64) \nDuring the federal government sequestration of 2013, Applicant lost a government contract which represented \n90 percent of his business. (Tr. 70; Answer at 41) Absent this income, the business began to struggle, and \nApplicant could not afford to pay his \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \nexpenses. In 2014, he consulted an attorney who advised him to restructure his debt through filing for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection. (Tr. 69) Applicant took his attorney\u2019s advice and filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in \nFebruary 2014. (Tr. 69) \nAfter Applicant reviewed the proposed plan, he was not confident that he had the income to successfully execute \nit. Upon his attorney\u2019s advice, he withdrew the petition and refiled a few months later in July 2014 after he had been \nawarded more contracts and was in a stronger position to comply with a Chapter 13 debt resolution plan. (Tr. 70) \nUltimately, Applicant paid 100 percent of his debt through the second bankruptcy plan, three years ahead of schedule. \n(Tr. 72)  \nCurrently, the only debt Applicant has is his home mortgage. (Tr. 76) His business has grown continuously since \n2014, and grossed $19.7 million of revenue in 2020. (Tr. 74) Applicant earned a salary of $161,544 in 2020 through his \nbusiness, and a salary of approximately $114,000 through another business that he started in 2018. (HE I) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive Branch has in regulating access \nto information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department \nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each \nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a \nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts \nalleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance abuse are set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription and non-prescription \ndrugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in \na manner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to  \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.   \nApplicant began using marijuana in 2016 and continued through June 2019, nearly a year after he completed \na security clearance application, and approximately eight months after an investigative agent interviewed him. \nDuring the time he used marijuana, he held a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance abuse,\u201d and 25(f), \n\u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position,\u201d applies. \nApplicant repeatedly expressed an intent to continue smoking marijuana during the investigative process, most \nrecently in response to interrogatories executed in June 2019. AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse,\u201d \napplies. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstance \nthat it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\u201d\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides\nevidence of action to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence,\nincluding but not limited to:\n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all\ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that\nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\nApplicant stopped using marijuana in 2019, and has executed two successive affidavits expressing his intent \nnot to smoke marijuana in the future. Although this triggers \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nthe application of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), it has minimal probative value, given Applicant\u2019s repeated, expressed intention, \nduring the investigative process, to use marijuana in the future.  \nIn October 2014, the then-Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a memorandum addressing \nchanges in state laws relating to marijuana. Specifically, he wrote as follows; \nAn individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of \nmarijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. \n(James \nR. \nClapper, \nDirector \nof \nNational \nIntelligence, memorandum, Adherence to Federal Laws \nProhibiting Marijuana Use (Oct. 25, 2014) \nAppeal Board jurisprudence has consistently followed the DNI memorandum without deviation or exception, \nnoting specifically that although several states have decriminalized marijuana use, it remains illegal under federal \nlaw, and as such, \u201cis subject to the applicable disqualifying conditions under the Directive.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n16-00258 at fn. 1 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2018)  \nDuring the investigative process, Applicant readily disclosed his marijuana use, and he testified that he \nthought the use posed no problem because it occurred in states where marijuana use was legal. This contention has \nno bearing on his security-clearance eligibility because it is longstanding legal precedent that ignorance or mistake \nof law is generally not an excuse for failing to abide by legal obligations. (Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 45 U.S. \n591, 613 (1846). Moreover, per Appeal Board jurisprudence, the completion of a security clearance application \nconstructively places applicants on notice of the incompatibility of marijuana use with security clearance eligibility. \n(ISCR Case No. 19-00540 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2019)   \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was infrequent. However, in light of his conflicting disclosures about when he \nstopped using marijuana, together with his use of marijuana with impunity, I am not persuaded that he has \nmitigated the drug involvement security concern. None of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) Applicant\u2019s DUI arrest of January 2014 generates the application of AG \u00b6 31(b), \n\u201cevidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.\u201d Applicant\u2019s arrest occurred seven years ago. He has never been arrested either before the DUI arrest or \nsince the DUI arrest. Under these circumstances AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal \nbehavior happened . . . that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies. Applicant\u2019s growth of his business that has occurred since the DUI \narrest and his extensive humanitarian activities triggers the mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful \n6 \n\n  \n \n  \n \n \nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity . . . good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d In sum, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the criminal \nconduct security concern.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s failure to report his 2014 DUI and his marijuana use, \nas required by NISPOM, Chapter 1, Section 3, paragraph 1-300, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible \nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information.\u201d \nAlthough Applicant did not promptly report his marijuana use, as required under the NISPOM, he reported it \nwhen he completed his security clearance application, and repeatedly disclosed his marijuana use throughout the \ninvestigative process. Moreover, he hired am FSO to handle the company\u2019s security maintenance and oversight \nresponsibilities. Under these circumstances, the first prong of AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has . . . taken . . . positive \nsteps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior . . .\u201d applies. However, Applicant\u2019s contradictory disclosures about when he reported the 2014 DUI \nraises doubts about his credibility, such that I am unable to conclude that the second prong of AG \u00b6 17(d) (\u201c. . . such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur\u201d) applies. \nThe conflicting evidence that Applicant provided regarding the date of his last marijuana use and his express \nintent to continue using marijuana as recently as June 2019, in tandem with the contradictory record evidence of when \nhe reported the 2014 DUI, lead me to resolve the personal conduct security concerns against Applicant.  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information,\u201d (AG \n\u00b6 18) \nApplicant\u2019s two bankruptcy petitions, filed in February 2014 and July 2014, respectively, trigger the \napplication of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s business struggles were isolated to the period of the 2013 federal government sequestration when \nmandatory \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \ncutbacks resulted in the loss of a major contract, rendering him unable to meet his business expenses. Subsequently, \nApplicant consulted an attorney who helped him file for Chapter 13 reorganization in February 2014 as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.a. When Applicant realized that he might not be able to comply with the court-imposed debt reduction \nplan, he withdrew the petition, waited until his company was on more solid financial footing, and filed another Chapter \n13 petition in July 2014, as alleged in subparagraph 1.b.  \nApplicant satisfied the payment plan three years ahead of schedule. His business has continued to grow, he \nholds no other debt other than a home mortgage, and he recently started another business which is also profitable. \nUnder these circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a \ndeath, divorce, or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d apply. Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) \nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;(5) the extent to which participation is \nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) \nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant is an extraordinary entrepreneur who started a business and developed it into an entity that employs \nmore than 100 people and earns millions of dollars of revenue annually. He is a pillar of his community, making \nsignificant donations to charities, and helping people in need. Although all of these attributes are commendable, \nthey do not obviate the responsibility to carefully review the security application while completing it, and to provide \nresponsive answers to the questions asked. Inattentiveness or misinterpretation of the law is not mitigating. Ultimately, \nthe nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct \u2013 using marijuana with a clearance for multiple months after \ncompleting a security clearance application \u2013 outweighs the positive factors, such as his sterling work performance, his \nprofessional success, and his charitable activities. Upon considering Applicant\u2019s conduct in the conduct of the whole-\nperson concept, I conclude that he failed to mitigate the security concerns. \n\nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 \nof Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: Paragraph 2, \nAgainst Applicant AGAINST \nGuideline E: \nAPPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c: Paragraph 3, \nAgainst Applicant \nGuideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: Paragraph 4, Guideline \nF: \nFor Applicant \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a- 4.b \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \nsecurity interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2014 in April 2016, \nand this mistake is not recent. His failure to disclose the late filing of his tax returns on his \nAugust 2, 2017 Questionnaire for National Security Position (SF 86) or security clearance \napplication (SCA) was not made with intent to deceive. Applicant is close to about 14 \nindividuals living in Iraq, and they are subject to serious risk of death if terrorists discover \nhe is helping the United States against their interests. However, he went on over 280 \ncombat missions with special forces units as a linguist.

(HE 3) Department Counsel requested a \nhearing. On May 1, 2020, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On June 18, 2020, \nthe case was assigned to me. Processing of the case was delayed due to the Corona \nVirus. On February 24, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na notice scheduling the hearing for March 8, 2021. (HE 1) The hearing was held as \nscheduled in the vicinity of Arlington, Virginia, using the U.S. Cyber Command video \nteleconference system. (Id.) Applicant waived his right under the Directive to 15 days of \nnotice of the date, time, and location of the hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 15) \nDepartment Counsel provided two exhibits, which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. (Tr. 18-19; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-GE 2) Applicant did not provide \nany exhibits at his hearing. (Tr. 21) On March 17, 2021, DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing. After the hearing, Applicant provided three exhibits, which were admitted \nwithout objection.

(Tr. \n100; AE B; HE 6) \nLegal Issues \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 3.a to change the date of Applicant\u2019s \nSCA from January 25, 2018, to August 2, 2017. (Tr. 16) Applicant did not object, and I \ngranted the motion to amend. (Tr. 16) I changed SOR \u00b6 3.a as requested, and I initialed \nand dated the change on the SOR. \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice concerning Iraq. (Tr. 19-20) \nApplicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice. (Tr. \n21) Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. \nOct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod \nv. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known \nor from government reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice concerning Iraq. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request is substantially quoted in the Iraq section with minor \ngrammatical and punctuation changes and without footnotes. In addition, I advised the \nparties that I might supplement the record with information from the U.S. Department of \nState website. The last two paragraphs in the Iraq section are largely quoted from the \nU.S. Department of State website, U.S. Relations With Iraq (Dec. 14, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-iraq/. (HE 5) \nThe parties did not request administrative notice of facts concerning Jordan. Since \nneither party requested administrative notice of facts regarding Jordan, and based on the \ndecision in ISCR Case No. 17-03026 (App. Bd. Jan, 16, 2019), I decided that absent an \nobjection, I intended to take administrative notice of the below facts concerning Jordan. \nOn April 4, 2021, I asked for any objections or other facts for administrative notice to be \nprovided to me not later than April 11, 2021. (HE 6) I sua sponte took administrative notice \nof facts concerning Jordan from ISCR Case No. 17-03266 (A.J. Sept. 11, 2018). \nEssentially, the security concerns from the risk of terrorism and insurgents in Jordan are \nsimilar but less extreme in comparison to those in Iraq. There were no objections to the \nproposed administrative notice concerning Jordan. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. ISCR and ADP decisions and \nthe Directive are available at https://ogc.osd.mil/doha/isp.html. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied all of the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.d and \u00b6 2.e. (HE 3) He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.d, \u00b6 2.f, and \u00b6 3.a. (Id.) \nHe also provided mitigating information. (Id.) \nApplicant is a 44-year-old Iraqi and United States dual citizen who seeks a security \nclearance to enable him to regain employment as a linguist. (Tr. 7) In 1995, he graduated \nfrom high school in Iraq, and in 1998, he graduated from a technical institute in Iraq. (Tr. \n7) From 2005 to 2008, he served as a linguist with U.S. armed forces in Iraq. From 2009 \nto 2010, Applicant worked as a part-time role player for the U.S. Army in the United States. \n(November 7, 2017, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) report of investigation (ROI) \nat 6) In 2010, he married, and in 2013, he divorced. (Tr. 7-8) His son is a nine-year-old \ncitizen of Iraq who resides in Jordan. (Tr. 8) In 2013, Applicant became a U.S. citizen, \nand in 2014, he received a U.S. passport. (SCA)   \nFinancial Considerations \nFrom 2011 to 2014, Applicant repaired six used cars damaged in accidents and \nthen he sent them to Iraq where they were sold. (Tr. 85-87, 92) He received $11,500 for \none car and $18,000 for another of the cars. (OPM ROI at 11) After paying expenses, he \nsaid he did not make a profit on the sale of the vehicles. (AE B) Some of the cars were \nused for a time by his relatives living in Iraq. (Tr. 83-84) He may have given one of the \ncars to his father, and then his father received the proceeds from the sale of this car.

(Tr. 85-86) There was no evidence presented that contradicted his statement that \nhe received no income or profit after paying expenses from the sale of the six cars. \nIn 2012 or 2013, Applicant sold a house in the United States for about $260,000, \nand he made a profit of around $100,000. (Tr. 80-82; OPM ROI at 11) In July 2017, he \nloaned $90,000 to an uncle who lived in the United States to pay off his uncle\u2019s house. \n(Tr. 62; OPM ROI at 11) As of November 2017, his uncle had repaid $37,000; however, \nthe remainder was not repaid. (Id.; AE C at 1) \nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the gain on the sale of a \nresidence of up to $250,000 is excluded from income for federal income tax purposes if \n\u201cowned and used [by the taxpayer as his or her] main home for a period aggregating at \nleast two years out of the five years prior to its date of sale.\u201d Internal Revenue Service \nwebsite, Topic No. 701 Sale of Your Home, available at https://www.irs.gov/ \ntaxtopics/tc701. An information return is not required unless the seller receives an \n\u201cincome-reporting document such as Form 1099-S, Proceeds From Real Estate \nTransactions,\u201d or has a non-excludable gain. (Id.) Applicant used the profits from the sale \nof his residence for living expenses when he was unemployed or underemployed, and to \npurchase or repair the six cars that he hoped to sell for a profit in Iraq. (Tr. 83-87) The \nSOR did not allege that Applicant failed to disclose income on his tax returns. Applicant \ndid not disclose the profit on the sale of his residence on his tax returns, and he was not \nasked to indicate how he qualified for the IRS homeowner\u2019s exclusion. It was clear from \nhis overall testimony that he had very limited knowledge of IRS rules on exclusions from \nincome and inclusions to income. \nThe SOR alleges in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d that Applicant failed to timely file federal \nand state tax income returns for tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. On \nNovember 7, 2017, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he did not file federal and \nstate tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 because he did not make enough money to \nfile. (OPM ROI at 10) The OPM ROI does not indicate how much income Applicant made \nin 2015 and 2016. (Id.) \nWhen Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories, he left the lines blank in the \ntable for listing the filing dates for his state and federal income tax returns for tax years \n2010, 2011, and 2012. (GE 2 at 2) He indicated that he filed his federal and state tax \nreturns as follows: for tax year 2013 on April 14, 2014; for tax year 2014 on April 13, 2016 \n(one year late); for tax year 2015 and 2016, he said he did not make enough income to \nnecessitate filing a tax return; for tax year 2017, he filed on March 3, 2018; and for tax \nyear 2018 he filed on March 13, 2018.

But actually, they didn\u2019t give me or they \ndidn\u2019t put me in a situation to pay it. Like, I\u2019m willing to pay it if I can pay it \nright now if I owe any money. I\u2019m not trying to hide anything. I thought this \nis the honest answer. I spoke my heart at that second when I answered the \nquestion. [Tr. 88-89] \nApplicant indicated he did not think he had to file a tax return because of his lack of income \nin 2015 and 2016.

He has taken enemy fire with the team and has been part of \nan ODA convoy when it was struck by an IED. Besides the danger he faces \nin operations with the ODA, is the danger he faces when he returns home \nto [his] province. Many members of his community discourage cooperation \nwith Coalition Forces, and would likely punish [Applicant] and his family \nseverely if they found out about his work. . . . I would highly recommend \n[Applicant] receive an immigration Visa to protect his family from the harsh \nconsequences that are sure to follow his cooperation with the United States. \nIn my opinion he has earned his place among Americans, as he has risked \nhis life to serve and protect them.

(AE A at 15) Applicant received 12 certificates \nand letters of appreciation from various Army units. (AE A at 16-27) \nIraq \nThe Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. Iraq\u2019s \n2018 parliamentary elections generally met international standards of free and fair \nelections and led to the peaceful transition of power from Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi \nto Adil Abd al-Mahdi. On December 1, 2019, in response to protesters\u2019 demands for \nsignificant changes to the political system, Abd al-Mahdi submitted his resignation, which \nthe Iraqi Council of Representatives (COR) accepted. Prime Minister Abd al-Mahdi has \ncontinued to serve in a caretaker capacity while the COR works to identify a replacement \nin accordance with the Iraqi constitution. \nThe U.S. Department of State (DOS) travel advisory for Iraq is Level 4: Do not \ntravel to Iraq due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, the Global Health Advisory, and \nIraq\u2019s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high \nrisk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in \nIraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian \nmilitias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by IEDs \noccur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. \nOn May 15, 2019, the DOS ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. \nGovernment employees from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad because of heightened \ntension with Iran. On September 24, 2019, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad again reported \nheightened tensions, noting that attacks in major cities may occur without warning and \nreiterating the DOS guidance to not travel to Iraq. \nBeginning in early October 2019, the country experienced large-scale protests in \nBaghdad and several Shia-majority governorates. Demonstrators gathered in the streets \nto reinforce their demands for an end to corruption and a restructuring of the government. \nCivilian authorities quickly lost control of the situation. Security and armed groups, \nincluding Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), responded with live ammunition, tear gas \ncanisters shot as projectiles, and concussion grenades, in an attempt to suppress the \ndemonstrations. By official accounts, as of December 17, 2019, more than 479 civilians \nwere killed and at least 20,000 were injured. \nOn December 27, 2019, a rocket attack on a base near Kirkuk in northern Iraq \nkilled a U.S. contractor and wounded four U.S. and two Iraqi servicemembers.

On December 31, 2019, supporters \nof KH and other Iran-backed Iraqi militias surrounded the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, \nforcing their way into the compound and setting some outer buildings on fire. Iraqi officials \nand security forces reestablished order outside the embassy, but tensions remained high, \nwith KH supporters and other pro-Iran figures threatening further action and vowing to \nexpel the United States from Iraq by force if necessary. \nOn January 2, 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that the U.S. \nmilitary had killed the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) \nCommander, Major General Qasem Soleimani, in a defensive action. The statement cited \nSoleimani\u2019s responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of Americans and coalition \nservicemembers and his approval of the embassy blockade in Baghdad, and asserted \nthat he was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and servicemembers \nin Iraq and throughout the region. According to subsequent media reports and United \nStates statements, Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike while leaving Baghdad \nInternational Airport early on the morning of January 3, 2020. In response, Prime Minister \nAdel Abd al Mahdi and President Barham Salih condemned the strike as a violation of \nlraqi sovereignty. On January 3, 2020, the U.S. Embassy issued an alert that cited \nheightened tensions in Iraq and the region and urged American citizens to depart Iraq \nimmediately. On March 26, 2020, due to a combination of security conditions and \nrestricted travel options as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the DOS ordered \nthe departure of designated U.S. Government employees at the U.S. Embassy in \nBaghdad and associated offices elsewhere in Iraq. \nThe Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is a designated terrorist organization \nconducting an active insurgency in Syria, with direct links to terrorist groups in Iraq and \nother parts of the world. It commits terrorist attacks, violent atrocities, and targets U.S. \ncitizens. The Iraqi government declared all of its territory liberated from ISIS in December \n2017; however, despite improved government control, ISIS remains a threat to public \nsafety in Iraq through the indiscriminate use of terrorist and asymmetrical attacks. \nIn January 2019, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI), delivered the \nWorldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community. In his Statement for \nthe Record, the DNI provided the following assessment of the situation in Iraq: ISIS still \ncommands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria, and it maintains eight branches, more \nthan a dozen networks, and thousands of dispersed supporters around the world, despite \nsignificant leadership and territorial losses. ISIS very likely will continue to pursue external \nattacks from Iraq and Syria against regional and Western adversaries, including the \nUnited States. In Iraq, Iran-supported Popular Mobilization Committee (PMF)-affiliated \nShia militias remain the primary threat to U.S. personnel, and the DNI expected that threat \nto increase as the threat ISIS poses to the militias recedes, Iraqi Government formation \nconcludes, some Iran-backed groups call for the United States to withdraw, and tension \nbetween Iran and the United States grows. The DNI continued to watch for signs that the \nIranian regime might direct its proxies and partners in Iraq to attack US interests. Iraq is \nfacing an increasingly disenchanted public.

Iraqi Shia militants conducted \nseveral attacks against US diplomatic facilities in Iraq in September and December 2018. \nThere is a serious risk from terrorism in Baghdad and Basra. ISIS fighters have \ngone underground and formed cells that still pose a danger throughout Iraq. These cells \nwill continue with their attempts to carry out high-profile attacks on Iraqi Security Force \npersonnel, government installations, and other soft targets in major population centers. \nIranian-backed Shia militias have previously targeted U.S. interests in Iraq. There are \nreports of Shia militia groups kidnapping locals, foreign workers, and members of \ninternational organizations and demanding ransoms from either their families or their \nemployers. A number of militia groups remain hostile to U.S. interests and continue to \npose a considerable potential threat, as either organized groups or individually as rogue \nelements that may take independent action. \nAccording to the United Nations, ISIS has killed more than 3,000 civilians and \ninjured more than 4,600 people since 2017. In its 2019 Human Rights Report, the U.S. \nDOS noted that Iraq\u2019s most significant human rights issues included: reports of unlawful \nor arbitrary killings, including extra-judicial killings; forced disappearances; torture; \narbitrary detention; harsh and life-threatening prison and detention center conditions; \narbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; the worst forms of restrictions on free \nexpression, the press, and the internet, including violence against journalists, censorship, \nsite blocking, and criminal libel; significant interference with the rights of peaceful \nassembly; legal restrictions on freedom of movement of women; threats of violence \nagainst internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnee populations perceived to have \nbeen affiliated with ISIS; and widespread official corruption. \nIraq\u2019s government, including the Office of the Prime Minister, investigated \nallegations of abuses and atrocities perpetrated by the Iraqi Security Forces, including an \ninvestigation of the October protests, but the Iraqi government rarely punished those \nresponsible for perpetrating or authorizing human rights abuses. Moreover, despite a \nreduction in numbers, ISIS continued to commit serious abuses and atrocities, including \nkillings through suicide bombings and IEDs. Some allegations of ISIS abuses and \natrocities were prosecuted, including suspected ISIS members under the 2005 \ncounterterrorism law. \nThe 2015 Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Protection Act \nof 2015 makes citizens of lraq ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United States under \nthe Visa Waiver Program. This exclusion reflects the determination of the Secretary of \nHomeland Security that Iraqi citizens are more likely to be a credible threat to the national \nsecurity of the United States; and that a foreign terrorist organization has a significant \npresence in Iraq; or that Iraq is a safe haven for terrorists. \nThe U.S. Mission in Iraq is dedicated to our enduring strategic partnership with the \nGovernment of Iraq and the Iraqi people. In coordination with the Global Coalition to \nDefeat ISIS, the United States assisted Iraq\u2019s efforts to achieve the December 2017 \nmilestone of liberating the country from ISIS. Following the territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq, \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe United States increased efforts to stabilize liberated areas as Iraq continues to \ndevelop as a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the \nUnited States in the region as well as a voice of moderation and democracy in the Middle \nEast. Iraq benefits from functioning government institutions, including an active \nlegislature, and plays an increasingly constructive role in the region. The United States \nmaintains vigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, \nand security issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement \n(SFA). The SFA between Iraq and the United States provides the foundation for the U.S.-\nIraq bilateral relationship. Covering a wide range of bilateral issues, including political \nrelations and diplomacy, defense and security, trade and finance, energy, judicial and law \nenforcement issues, services, science, culture, education, and environment, it \nemphasizes the important relationship and common goals the two countries share. Efforts \nto implement the SFA are overseen by the Higher Coordinating Committee and several \nJoint Coordination Committees. \nU.S. bilateral assistance to Iraq focuses on economic reform, assistance to \nvulnerable groups, and democracy and governance. The U.S. continues to help \nstrengthen the capacity of Iraq\u2019s civil society organizations and elected representatives. \nU.S. bilateral assistance aims not only to bolster Iraq\u2019s democratic institutions, but also to \npreserve the strategic, political, and economic importance of the U.S.-Iraq partnership in \na changing Middle East region. Since 2014, the United States has contributed billions of \ndollars in humanitarian, demining, and stabilization aid to conflict-affected and displaced \nIraqis in the region, including support for communities recovering from genocide. \nJordan \nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) is a constitutional monarchy ruled by \nKing Abdullah II bin Hussein. In 2013 and 2014, the U.S. provided Jordan $2.25 billion in \nloan guarantees, allowing Jordan access to affordable financing from international capital \nmarkets. The U.S.-Jordan free trade agreement (FTA), the U.S.\u2019s first FTA with an Arab \ncountry, has expanded the trade relationship by reducing barriers for services, providing \ncutting-edge protection for intellectual property, ensuring regulatory transparency, and \nrequiring effective labor and environmental enforcement. The United States and Jordan \nhave an \u201copen skies\u201d civil aviation agreement; a bilateral investment treaty; a science and \ntechnology cooperation agreement; and a memorandum of understanding on nuclear \nenergy cooperation. Such agreements bolster efforts to help diversify Jordan\u2019s economy \nand promote growth. Jordan and the United States belong to a number of the same \ninternational organizations, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, \nWorld Bank, and World Trade Organization. Jordan also is a Partner for Cooperation with \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. \nThe U.S. DOS assesses the threat of terrorism in Jordan as high; with the capital \nof Amman currently assessed as a high-threat location for terrorist activity directed at or \naffecting official U.S. Government interests. Transnational and indigenous terrorist \ngroups in Jordan have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks. Violent \nextremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State of lraq and the Levant (ISIL) \n(also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS) and Jabhat al-Nusra, have \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconducted attacks in Jordan and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and \nWestern interests, and soft targets such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of \nworship, restaurants, schools, and malls. Jordan\u2019s prominent role in the effort to defeat \nISIS, and its shared borders with Iraq and Syria, increase the potential for future terrorist \nincidents. \nAlthough Jordan remained a committed partner on counterterrorism and \ncountering violent extremism in 2016, numerous terrorist incidents reflect the current \nsecurity situation in Jordan: throughout 2017, multiple vehicle-borne improvised explosive \ndevices detonated in and around a refugee camp in Syria near the Jordanian border; and \nin October 2017, two homemade explosive devices were found in another refugee camp \nin Jordan. Also in October 2017, the State Security Court (SSC) prosecuted six people \nfor sympathizing with ISIS, after they created social media accounts to recruit Jordanian \nsupporters for ISIS and promoted terrorist activity. In September 2017, the SSC charged \n16 people with a terrorist plot involving the use of automatic weapons to carry out terrorist \nattacks against public security services; and the Jordanian General Intelligence \nDirectorate arrested a 10-person ISIS cell that was planning to attack security forces and \ntourist locations using explosive suicide belts. Throughout 2017, there were numerous \ninstances of extremists posting pro-ISIS videos or statements on social media. \nU.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria and the U.S. Government\u2019s policies on Israel, \nhave fueled anti-American feelings in Jordan. Recent surveys reflect that over 80% of the \nJordanian population has an unfavorable view of the U.S. Government. The U.S. DOS \nhas assessed Amman as being a high-threat location for political violence directed at or \naffecting official U.S. Government interests. In December 2017, protests took place at the \nU.S. Embassy for 27 days after the announcement that the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv \nwould move to Jerusalem. \n \n \nAs a regional leader in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, Jordan played an \nimportant role in Coalition successes in degrading the terrorist group\u2019s territorial control \nand operational reach. During 2016, Jordanian authorities took legal action against \nnumerous individuals accused of terrorism under Jordanian law. On July 13, 2016, the \nJordanian State Security Court filed charges against 21 suspected ISIS affiliates in \nconnection with the pre-emptive March raid on an alleged ISIS safe house in lrbid. The \nDOS assesses that the potential for terrorist activity is heightened as Jordan participates \nin the coalition against ISIS. Extremist groups have carried out terrorist activities against \nU.S. and Jordanian government targets in Jordan. Terrorist groups often do not \ndistinguish between U.S. Government personnel and private U.S. citizens, and may target \nareas frequented by Westerners, such as tourist sites, hotels, restaurants, shopping \nmalls, and transportation hubs. \nAccording to the DOS 2017 Human Rights Report, Jordan\u2019s most significant \ncontinuing human rights problems include allegations of torture by security and \ngovernment officials; arbitrary arrest and detention, including of activists and journalists; \ninfringements on privacy rights; restrictions on freedom of expression; and restrictions on \nfreedom of association and assembly. Impunity remained widespread, and the \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngovernment did not take sufficiently strong steps to investigate, prosecute, or punish \nofficials who committed abuses. \nThe Jordanian SSC took legal action against numerous individuals deemed to be \nterrorists under local law, including the arrest and prosecution of men accused of seeking \nto join Al-Nusra Front (ANF) and ISIS. Other arrests and prosecutions involved \nsupporting/recruiting for ISIS and attempted travel to/from Syria in support of extremist \nactivities and also for \u201cpropagating ISIL ideology,\u201d a charge often used for online activity. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances.

See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant timely filed all tax returns except for tax year 2014. He said he filed his \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax year 2014 on April 13, 2016 (one year late). \nHe did not indicate his income on these tax returns for tax year 2014. On August 2, 2017, \nhe completed his SCA. On November 7, 2017, he completed his OPM PSI. On October \n29, 2019, the SOR was issued. All tax returns were filed before he submitted his SCA. \nApplicant was generally unfamiliar with tax issues, and may not have needed to file a \nfederal tax return in 2014 because he might not have met the IRS income threshold. \nMoreover, he did not repeat the late filing of his tax returns after 2016. See ISCR Case \nNo. 19-01643 at 4-7 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2021) (Duffy, A.J., dissenting) (explaining that \nfailure to timely file tax returns is not an automatic disqualifying circumstance, and it may \nbe mitigated depending on its recency and other reasons). There is no evidence that he \nviolated any tax-filing requirements since April 13, 2016. \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence shows that he has good judgment, is reliable, \nprofessional, and responsible. Tax filing timeliness errors for a single tax year, when his \noverdue tax returns were filed in 2016, are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not disclose on his August 2, 2017 SCA that he failed to timely file \nhis federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2014 until April 13, 2016. The Appeal \nBoard has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission. \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). Applicant has an unsophisticated level of understanding about \nfinances and taxes and the English language. He did not carefully consider the question \nabout timely filing tax returns on his August 2, 2017 SCA. He merely concluded that he \nwas filing his tax returns and paying his taxes without considering year-by-year for the \nprevious seven years when he filed his tax returns. When a DOHA interrogatory asked \nabout filing his tax returns year-by-year, he disclosed the late filing of his 2014 tax return. \nHis erroneous answer on his August 2, 2017 SCA was a mistake caused by his \nunfamiliarity with the careful consideration required when completing security documents \nrelating to taxes.

They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant has the following Middle East connections: (1) his son is a citizen of Iraq \nand a resident of Jordan; (2) his brother and five sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq; \n(3) he has close ongoing connections with about 14 persons who are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq, including four brothers-in-law; and (4) he provided financial support to \nhis relatives in Iraq.  \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd.

See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing \nproblematic visits of that applicant\u2019s father to Iran). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws.

Feb. 20, \n2002)). \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government are \namong the important considerations that provide context for the other record evidence \nand must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.

Mar. 13, 2017)). \nAnother important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with \nthe United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government coercion \nor inducement.  \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorism causes a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationships of Iraq and \nJordan with the United States and the situations involving terrorists and insurgents in \nthose two countries place a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate \nthat his relationships with any family member or friend living in or visiting them do not \npose a security risk because of the risks due to terrorists in those two countries. Applicant \nshould not be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty \nto the United States and concerns about assisting someone living in or visiting Iraq or \nJordan. \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 \nn. 18 (App. Bd. July 28, 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security \nsignificance: \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on \ntheir prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is whether an \napplicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members in a foreign \n19 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncountry raise security concerns because those ties and contacts create a \npotential vulnerability that a foreign power, [criminals, or terrorists] could \nseek to exploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified \ninformation that an applicant \n-- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers -- has by virtue of a security clearance. A person may be \nvulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, or through, the person\u2019s \nimmediate family members -- regardless of whether the person\u2019s family \nmembers are prominent or not. \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries hostile \nto the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at \n5 (App. Bd.

International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Iraq and Jordan have \na significant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family or contacts in those \ncountries \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those who \nseek U.S. information or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d \nADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at \n3 (App. Bd.

Those relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel \nproduced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with people living in those two \ncountries and financial connections to persons in Iraq and has raised the issue of potential \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation.

He has frequent contacts with about 14 of them. His son is a citizen of Iraq and a \nresident of Jordan. As recently as 2017, he provided financial support to his brother and \nsister who are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant\u2019s assistance to the United States \nas a linguist will place his family living in Iraq and Jordan in danger if terrorists learn of this \nassistance. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege: (1) Applicant\u2019s parents live with him, and they \nlikely have frequent contacts with and affection for their children and others living in Iraq; \n(2) Applicant traveled to Iraq to assist family as recently as 2017; and (3) Applicant sent \nsix cars to Iraq as recently as 2014, which were sold in Iraq. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd.

The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \nThe Appeal Board has concluded that contact every two months or three months\nconstitutes \u201cfrequent contact\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8. ISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3-4 (App.\nBd. Oct. 14, 2016). See also ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Applicant has frequent contact\nwith about 14 relatives and others who are citizens and residents of Iraq. He also has\naffection for his son, who is an Iraqi citizen living in Jordan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has significant connections to the United \nStates. Applicant is a citizen of the United States, and his parents live in the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Iraq, including the dangers that service entailed, \nweighs heavily towards mitigation of security concerns. Applicant seeks a security \nclearance to enable him to continue providing assistance to DOD as a linguist. He has \nshown his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his support to DOD \nwhile serving in Iraq. In ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal \nBoard explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to support \na favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR Case No. 05-\n03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in support of U.S. \nforces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of dangerous high-risk \ncircumstances in which [he] made a significant contribution to national \nsecurity.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd.

In addition, Iraq is a key U.S. ally \nin combatting terrorism, and Iraq has been a leading recipient of U.S. assistance, \nreceiving billions of dollars in aid and military reimbursements since 2014. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Iraq and Jordan. Applicant has close relationships with family and other \ncontacts in those countries, and they are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human \nrights violations of the Iraqi and Jordanian governments. Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation could add significant risk to his relatives and contacts living in those countries. \nMany linguists in Iraq also have family in Iraq, and their families in Iraq have the same \nrisk of injury or death as Applicant\u2019s siblings, in-laws, and other contacts. Being raised in \nIraq adds to their understanding of Iraqi culture and increases their ability to communicate \nwith Iraqis. An extensive background in Iraq can result in a more effective linguist and \nincrease the linguist\u2019s contributions to U.S. mission accomplishment and national \nsecurity. \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives and contacts residing in Iraq and \nJordan are significant; however, he supported the United States as a linguist in Iraq from \nabout January 2005 to August 2008. He went on more than 280 combat missions and \nwas repeatedly exposed to injury or death. In August 2008, he immigrated to the United \nStates. His connections to the United States, and support to the United States in a combat \nenvironment, taken together, are sufficient to overcome the foreign influence security \nconcerns under Guideline B. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept.

Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n23 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old Iraqi and United States dual citizen who seeks \nemployment as a linguist. In 1995, he graduated from high school, and in 1998, he \ngraduated from a technical institute in Iraq. From about January 2005 to August 2008, he \nserved as a linguist with U.S. Forces in Iraq. From 2009 to 2010, he worked as a part-\ntime role player and linguist for the U.S. Army in the United States. In 2010, he married, \nand in 2013, he divorced. His nine-year-old son is a citizen of Iraq who resides in Jordan.  \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is substantial. Applicant filed \nhis federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2014 one year late in 2016. He has \nabout 14 relatives and contacts in Iraq, and he has frequent contacts with them. He has \ngiven financial support to his siblings in Iraq as recently as 2017. He traveled to Iraq to \nhelp family members as recently as 2017. His parents live with him, and they are citizens \nof Iraq and likely have frequent contacts with family and others in Iraq. He shipped six \ncars to Iraq as recently as 2014 for sale in Iraq. \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iraq and Jordan must take into consideration \nthe geopolitical situation and dangers in these two countries. See ISCR Case No. 04-\n02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of \ngeopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). Those \ncountries are dangerous places because of violence from terrorists, and their \ngovernments do not respect the full spectrum of human rights. Terrorists continue to \nthreaten the Iraq and Jordan governments, the interests of the United States, U.S. Armed \nForces, and those who cooperate and assist the United States. The United States, Iraq, \nand Jordan are allies in the war on terrorism.  \nThe evidence mitigating security concerns is more persuasive than the evidence \nagainst mitigation. Applicant served as a linguist in Iraq and went on at least 280 combat \nmissions with special operations forces. He made contributions to U.S. national security \nat personal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Iraq. All these circumstances increase \nthe probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign \npower, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit him. See ISCR Case No. \n07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). His past honorable service in Iraq weighs heavily \ntowards mitigation of foreign influence security concerns.

(HE 2) He did not timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for TYs 2006 through 2011 because he did not believe he had \nsufficient funds to pay his taxes at the end of the year.

(Tr. 46) \nHe believed he timely filed his federal income tax return for TY 2018. (Tr. 46) I have \ncredited Applicant with timely filing his TY 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns, and \nwith mitigation of SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nApplicant has not filed his state and federal income tax returns for TYs 2019 and\n2020, and he intends for his tax attorney to file these overdue tax returns. (Tr. 40, 44, 51-\n52) He did not request any filing extensions for his federal income tax returns.

(Tr. 48-49) The payment plan \nwas interrupted by a vehicle accident; however, Applicant did not provide details about \nwhy the vehicle accident caused his IRS payment plan to end. (AE B) Funds were needed \nfor a down payment possibly for a new vehicle. (AE B) He is waiting for his tax attorney \nto arrange a payment plan for his IRS debt.

An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6 19(f). Discussion of this disqualifying \ncondition is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant described several circumstances partially or fully beyond his control that \nadversely affected his finances: (1) the decline in the economy in 2008; (2) Applicant\u2019s \nincome was reduced; (3) he was underemployed or unemployed; (4) his family expenses \nfor housing, vehicles, and his daughter\u2019s college education; (5) a vehicle accident; (6) his \nwife\u2019s illness and unemployment; (7) his mother moved into his home in lieu of a long-\nterm care facility; (8) his difficulties obtaining assistance from the IRS; and (9) the COVID-\n19 pandemic. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence of how these circumstances \ncaused him to be unable to timely file his state and federal income tax returns, and to \nresume his IRS payment plan. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for TYs 2006 through \n2011 (filed in 2013 or 2014). He has an outstanding federal income tax debt of about \n$15,000. He has not filed his federal income tax returns for 2019 and 2020. A willful failure \nto timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal income tax return is a \nmisdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file \nreturn, supply information, or pay tax, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as crimes. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with\ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary\ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified\ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we\nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting\ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By\nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax\nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s\njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her\nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment\nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See\nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173,\n183 (D.C.

June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information must nevertheless be denied. In ISCR Case No. \n15-1031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return \nin December 2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal \ntax return in October 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each \nyear. Nevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to \ngrant access to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn addition to his federal income tax issues, Applicant has not filed his state income \ntax returns for TYs 2017 through 2020. He may owe state income taxes. \nApplicant provided some important evidence of mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g) \nbecause he has hired a tax attorney to help him get his overdue tax returns filed, and to \nestablish a payment plan with the IRS. He filed all of his federal income tax returns up to \nTYs 2019 and 2020. However, under the DOHA Appeal Board jurisprudence, this is too \nlittle, too late to mitigate security concerns. He did not establish he was unable to make \ngreater progress sooner filing his federal and state income tax returns. He should have \nacted more aggressively to establish a payment plan to address his federal income tax \ndebt. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept.

The Appeal Board \nhighlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and expenses, and \nspouse\u2019s serious medical and mental-health problems. The Appeal Board emphasized \n\u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well \nsettled that failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks \nand brackets omitted)). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, \nand stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for \nthe protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d).  \nThe Appeal Board reversed the favorable decision of the administrative judge in a \ncase where the applicant filed his 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax returns in February 2014 and \nhis 2012 tax return in August 2015 all before the SOR was issued. ISCR Case No. 15-\n03481 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). The applicant owed less than $1,800 in federal \nincome taxes for those four TYs at the time of the decision. Id. The Appeal Board found \nthe timing of the filing of his tax returns to be an important factor stating: \nApplicant did not resolve his tax filing delinquencies until after submission\nof his security clearance application and after undergoing his background\ninterview. Taking action to resolve the delinquent tax filings well after the\ninitiation of the security clearance process undercuts a determination that\nthose actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquencies. Id.\nat 5. \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance of the \nrequirement to timely file his state and federal income tax returns, and the requirement to \npay his federal income taxes in the context of his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. He did not establish he was unable to make greater progress sooner in the \nresolution of his tax issues. His actions under the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too \nlittle, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. See ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sept. 27, 2016). Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his tax returns and pay his federal \nincome taxes \u201cmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide \nby rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the Dorfmont \npresumption. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

In January 2016, he was convicted of driving under the \ninfluence. In June 2018, he was convicted of reckless driving and driving under \nsuspension. As with his other charges and convictions, these were all misdemeanors. He \nadmits all related allegations and only disputes the reckless driving misdemeanor from \nApril 2014 (SOR allegation 2.n). \nApplicant attributes these violations to his youth, rushing to help with the care of \nhis first born child, and other family circumstances. (Tr. 16, 19) In particular, he cites to \nhis haste in making weekly three-and-a-half hour trips back-and-forth from his home to \nsee his ailing mother, who was suffering from advanced-stage cancer. (Tr. 17-19) She \nultimately passed away at the end of 2015. He has had no additional driving infractions \nsince June 2018.

(Tr. 55) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence, and transcends \nduty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in those \ngranted such access. Decisions necessarily include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions \nshall be in terms of the national interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \nAnalysis \nGUIDELINE F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this guideline \nis that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations. All of these factors can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Here, \nthe Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant has multiple \ndelinquent debts and that he failed to file his 2015 federal taxes. This is sufficient to invoke \nfinancial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nUnder these facts, four conditions could mitigate related security concerns:  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or under control, and  \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant concedes that his irresponsibility with money when he was younger led \nto much of his current delinquent debt and financial distress. Today, he stresses, he is \ntrying to be more responsible. His documentation appears to show that he is now set to \nbegin making payments on about $30,000 in student loans in the near future. He also \nshowed that he is having payments made toward his child support arrearage, paid one of \ntwo medical bills, and satisfied one adverse judgment for approximately $2,281. His \ndocuments reflect that he has prepared, and most likely filed, his 2015 tax return with the \nIRS. However, there is no evidence of payment dispute, or correspondence regarding, \nhis remaining delinquent debts. There is no evidence that he has received financial \ncounseling. While he is clearly sincere in wanting to resolve his financial situation, little \nprogress can realistically be done with a net monthly remainder of only $100 and scant \nfinancial savings.  At best, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in part. \nGUIDELINE E - Personal Conduct  \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . . \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \nThe following disqualifying condition is applicable to the concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \nfrequent misdemeanor driving, qualification, and conduct infractions: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant\u2019s infractions mostly occurred when he was in his 20s, rushing back and \nforth to help care for his ailing mother or help care for a young child. He acknowledges \nhis recklessness and negligence at the time. With his eldest child now 11, he has \ncomported his behavior appropriately in order to serve as a role model.  Moreover, all of \nthe infractions at issue were misdemeanors. Applicant has completed a safe driving \ncourse. He has paid all related fines and his driver\u2019s permit is valid. He has not had \nanother infraction in over three years. Under these facts, AG \u00b6 17(c)-(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I am also \nmindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old information technology (IT) operational analyst who has \nearned an associate\u2019s degree in computer science. He is single. Applicant is the father of \ntwo children, ages 11 and 3. The youngest child lives with him.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nApplicant has made some progress in addressing his delinquent debts, with much \nof the progress coming recently. He does not have a long track record of addressing his \ndelinquent debts and straightening out his financial situation. Undeniably, some progress \nhas been made. His ability to continue going forward, however, is dubious. In September \n2021, he is to start making payments on two student loan accounts with significant \nbalances; other delinquent debts remain outstanding. Applicant failed to describe a viable \nstrategy for addressing these delinquent debts with a net monthly remainder of only about \n$100 and highly limited savings. While he is sincere in his desire to address his financial \nsituation, he has not shown that he is presently able to do so. While time and maturity \nhave helped mitigate personal conduct security concerns related to his misdemeanor \ninfractions, financial considerations security concerns remain unmitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o-q: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r-s: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.v:  \nFor Applicant \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n  Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

The request and the attached source documents were \nnot admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Exhibit (Item 6) All of the \ndocuments referenced in the Request for Administrative Notice and the facts asserted \ntherein, are from open sources and are dated. Lebanon has been plagued by corruption \nand human rights abuses. The country is often lawless; and it has been described as a \nfailed-nation-state. The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to reconsider or avoid \ntravel to Lebanon in certain areas due to terrorism and outbreaks of violence, especially \nnear Lebanon\u2019s borders with Syria and Israel. \nApplicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the Item 6 source documents, and incorporated them by reference. The \nfacts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated in this decision. \nFindings of Fact1  \nApplicant is a 47-year-old male of Lebanese descent and citizenship. He entered \nthe United States on a business visa in February 1999. Applicant is divorced with no \nchildren.

(Item 3) From 2010 until 2015, he resided in the United \nStates, (Item 5) except for an unauthorized visit to see his mother in 2010. In 2016, he \nobtained a new Lebanese passport to visit his brother in Saudi Arabia. On his security \nclearance application of January 2018, he reported he lived in Lebanon from July 2016 \nuntil the present (2018). (Item 3). He attended multiple universities from 2009 until 2020, \nwhen he obtained his undergraduate degree. He received his undergraduate degree in \n2000 from a University in Lebanon.

(2.a) \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations under Guideline B, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.e, in his Answer to the SOR. \nAfter Applicant\u2019s submission of financial information in response to the FORM, \nthe Government withdrew the Guideline F allegation in paragraph three of the \nStatement of Reasons, in its entirety. (FORM) \nApplicant admits that he is a dual citizen of Lebanon and the United States. (1.a) \nHe used the Lebanese passport when he returned to Lebanon for university. He is \nwilling to renounce it. (Item 4) \nApplicant no longer has a bank account in Lebanon (1.b) According to him it has \nhis brother\u2019s name on it. He provided no support for his answer. It is in his brother\u2019s \nname according to response. He admitted this allegation in his answer. The value was \nlisted at $4,000. In his subject interview he admitted he opened a bank account in \nLebanon in 2018. (Item 4) \nApplicant has one brother who is a citizen of Lebanon and a resident of Saudi \nArabia. (1.c) He has never applied for U.S. citizenship. His brother helped Applicant \nfinancially when he was going to university. Applicant speaks electronically to his \nbrother on a weekly basis. (Item 4) \nApplicant has a cousin who is a police officer in Lebanon for the Ministry of \nJustice. (1.d) He reports casual contact with him. \nApplicant maintains close and continuing contact with at least three aunts and \none cousin who are citizens and residents of Lebanon. (1.e) When Applicant returned to \nLebanon in 2015, he maintained weekly contact with his aunt in person. (Item 3) His \nmother came to visit him when he was in Lebanon. He stated that he returned to \nLebanon in 2015 to continue university study because it was affordable. (Item A, Item 3, \nItem 5) He also had a neighbor and cousin in Lebanon during this time.

(Item 4) He appealed the decision, but he did not win. He \nregrets his actions and states that it has haunted him for too long. (Item 2) He \nunderstands that these actions will have an impact on the rest of his life. (Item 2). \nHowever, in his subject interview, he told the investigator about the incident, but stated \nthat nothing came of it. (Item 4) He also admitted that when he was first confronted by \nan investigator, he denied the cheating incident. He also initially denied cheating to the \nUniversity. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n(c) failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a \nforeign person, group, government, or country; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nThe Government has presented a prima facie case for foreign influence. \nApplicant has been in Lebanon from 2015 to 2018. He has a connection to Lebanon \nand his family who are citizens and residents of Lebanon. Close and continuing ties \nwith family members who are citizens of a foreign country with demonstrated terrorist \ngroups toward the United States create a heightened risk. Applicant\u2019s ties create a \npotential conflict of interest and make him vulnerable to foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. Applicant was terminated from his \nposition as a linguist working for the U.S. mission in Iraq, after he left without \nauthorization to visit his ill mother in Lebanon. This action reinforced the Government\u2019s \nconcern. Applicant admits his close contact with his family in Lebanon with whom he is \nbound by affection. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts may create a potential conflict of \ninterest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, and coercion, both directly and through his family members. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8.  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation;  \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n6 \n \nf) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States: \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.2 \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. Lebanon is such a country as outlined in the Administrative Notice for this \ncase. \nApplicant came to the United States in 1999. He became a U.S. citizen in 2008. \nHe surrendered his passport in 2006, but in 2016, he obtained a new one. He served as \na contractor linguist in Iraq with the military forces from 2007 until 2010, but was \nterminated from that position for leaving to go to Lebanon without authorization to see \nhis ill mother. There is no information about his assets in the United States. He returned \nto Lebanon in 2015 to 2018 to attend University after he was dismissed from an \nAmerican University for cheating. Some of his family members have affiliation with the \nLebanonese government. His family knows about his work and seeking a clearance..I \nfind that all foreign influence concerns are not mitigated. Applicant has not carried his \nburden of proof in this case. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n2 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nAreas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination \nunder any other single guideline, but which, when \nconsidered \nas \na \nwhole, \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment\u2026.. or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors in AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions none of them apply. Applicant cheated \non a University exam and initially denied the cheating during his background \ninvestigation interview. This occurred in 2015. In his subject interview he lied to the \ninvestigator and stated that nothing came of the situation. He has shown untrustworthy \nbehavior and a pattern of dishonesty. This is not minor, nor did he make good-faith \nefforts to correct an omission before being confronted with the facts. He has not \nreceived counseling or really acknowledged his behavior. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n  \n \n \n \n                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n                                               \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated foreign influence and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:              \nAGAINST Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nWITHDRAWN \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On February 25, 2021, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling the hearing for April \n20, 2021. (HE 1) \nDepartment Counsel provided eight exhibits, and Applicant objected to two \nexhibits. Six exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. (Transcript (Tr.) 10; \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1-GE 6) Applicant objected to the admissibility of Applicant\u2019s \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interviews (PSI) because of the \nlack of an authenticating witness. (Tr. 10) Applicant said he could not remember what he \ntold the OPM investigator, and he would not confirm the accuracy of the OPM PSI \nsummaries. (Tr. 91-94) I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection and concluded his OPM PSIs \nwere inadmissible; however, the two exhibits are included for the record.

(AE D) \nSudan \nOn April 11, 2019, following months of protests, civil unrest, and a national state \nof emergency, the Sudanese army announced the overthrow of the government of \nPresident Omar Hassan al Bashir and the establishment of a transitional military council. \nPrevious to this, Sudan was a republic with power concentrated in the hands of \nauthoritarian President al-Bashir and the National Congress Party, which had maintained \nnearly absolute political authority in Sudan for three decades. \nThe transition to a new government was not entirely peaceful. On June 3, 2019, \nsecurity forces violently dispersed protesters at a sit-in, killing and injuring hundreds. On \nJune 5, 2019, the U.S. Department of State released the following: \"The United States \ncondemns the recent attacks on protesters in Sudan . . . We call on Sudan's Transitional \nMilitary Council and the Rapid Support Forces to desist from violence and we call for \nresumed contact with the Forces for Freedom and Change with the aim of a civilian-led \ntransition that leads to timely elections and free expression of the will of the Sudanese \npeople.\u201d U.S. Dept. of State, Press Statement: Situation in Sudan (June 5, 2019). \nOn June 6, 2019, the U.S. Embassy cited violence and civil unrest continuing in \nKhartoum and in cities across Sudan, resulting in local travel by U.S. government \npersonnel being limited to minimal, officially approved movements only. \nIn September 2019, Sudan officially formed the civilian-led transitional government \n(CLTG). The CLTG is composed of a Sovereign Council, a Council of Ministers headed \nby the prime minister, and a Legislative Council.

On August 20, Dr. Abdalla Hamdok \nwas sworn in as prime minister. Under the constitutional declaration, general elections \nare to be held in 2022. The country last held national elections (presidential and National \nAssembly) in 2015. Since the formation of the CLTG, large-scale protests have died \ndown. Smaller, localized protests have continued with a focus on injustices committed by \nthe Bashir regime and violence that took place during the protest period leading to the \ncreation of the CLTG. Most of the protests have been nonviolent, but they often led to \nroad closures by security forces and the protesters. At times, the security forces have \nused tear gas to disperse protestors. \nSince 1993, the U.S. Secretary of State has designated Sudan as a State Sponsor \nof Terrorism for supporting international terrorist groups, including the Abu Nidal \nOrganization, Palestine Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hizballah. The CLTG asserted it does \nnot support terrorist organizations that were tolerated under the Bashir regime. The CLTG \nhas taken steps to limit the activities of these terrorism organizations and worked to \ndisrupt foreign fighters\u2019 use of the country as a logistics base and transit point. The \nDepartment of State assesses Khartoum as being a HIGH-threat location for terrorism \ndirected at or affecting official U.S. government interests. Elements of ISIS, al-Qa\u2019ida, and \nmany other terrorist organizations recruit in Sudan. As of August 2020, the Department \nof State's travel advisory for Sudan was Level 3: Reconsider travel to Sudan due to crime, \nterrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict. \nTerrorist groups are still active in Sudan and have stated their intent to harm \nWesterners and Western interests through suicide operations, bombings, shootings, and \nkidnappings. \nDespite the absence of high-profile terrorist attacks, ISIS facilitation networks \nappear to be active within Sudan. The newly appointed Minister of Religious Affairs and \nEndowments under the CLTG denied the existence of an official ISIS entity in Sudan but \nacknowledged that there were \u201cextremists\u201d linked to ISIS in the country. The Minister of \nReligious Affairs and Endowments also emphasized that his ministry would work on \ncombating extremism, fighting terrorism and renewing school curricula to promote \ntolerance. \nIn 2003, non-Arabs in the western region of Darfur, who since 1990 have accused \nthe government of systematic discrimination, marginalization, and oppression, rebelled \nagainst the government, protesting decades of political and economic neglect. The \ngovernment responded with brutal force, including the use of Arab militias known as \nJanjaweed. In the ensuing conflict, more than 300,000 people were killed. To date, the \nconflict in Darfur has affected 4.7 million people, including more than 1.76 million \ninternally displaced persons (IDPs) in need of humanitarian assistance. The United States \ncharacterized the government and affiliated militia attacks on civilians in 2004 as \ngenocide. \nIn mid-2011, following South Sudan's independence, conflict broke out between \nthe government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North in Southern \nKordofan and Blue Nile states. The conflict has severely affected or displaced more than \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n1.1 million people within the two areas and caused more than 300,000 people to flee to \nneighboring countries. The government of Sudan announced in January 2019 that it\nwould continue indefinitely its unilateral cease fire, in effect since 2016, with armed rebels\nthroughout the Blue Nile region and Southern Kordofan region. The Sudan People's\nLiberation Movement-North has also maintained its unilateral cessation of hostilities\nwithout a commensurate announcement. \n \n \n \n \n \nSignificant human rights issues under the Bashir government included: unlawful or \narbitrary killings; forced disappearances; torture; and arbitrary detentions, all by security \nforces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners; arrests and \nintimidation of journalists, censorships, newspaper seizures, and site blockings; \nsubstantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, \nsuch as overly restrictive nongovernmental organization (NGO) laws; restrictions on \nreligious liberty; restrictions on political participation; widespread corruption; lack of \naccountability in cases involving violence against women; trafficking in persons; outlawing \nof independent trade unions; and child labor. Respect for human rights, in particular \nfundamental freedoms of expression, assembly, and religion, greatly improved after the \nCLTG took power. \nBashir government authorities did not investigate human rights violations by its \nsecurity services or any other branch of the security services. However, the CLTG has \nlaunched a human rights investigation into the June 3, 2019 security force violations. In \naddition, the attorney general and security forces had agreed on a temporary process to \nremove immunity from security forces and government institutions involved in human \nrights violations. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility[.] \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to . . . award benefits or status . . . .\u201d \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant filed an application for food stamps containing a \nfalse statement that he had less than $100 in cash or his bank account. Applicant said he \ncould not remember how much money he had in his bank account. He said his trips to \nthe Middle East at the time he completed his food stamp application were funded with a \ncredit card. There is insufficient evidence of record that he had more than $100 in cash \nor in his bank account when he completed the food stamp application to establish SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. Applicant has a college degree, and he is a professional linguist. Applicant\u2019s \nstatements at his hearing that he was confused or misinterpreted the question are not \ncredible. Nevertheless, the admissible evidence does not prove that his statement in his \nfood stamp application about the amount of money he had at that time was false. The \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a is refuted. \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 includes one disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(d) states: \u201c(d) deceptive or illegal financial \npractices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, \nmortgage fraud, filing deceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust.\u201d \nSOR \u00b6 2.a reiterates SOR \u00b6 1.a in the context of finances. SOR \u00b6 2.a is not \nestablished for the same reason that SOR \u00b6 1.a is not established. The specific allegation \nof making a false statement about the amount of money he had when he filed his food \nstamp application is refuted. \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d stating: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nApplicant has the following Sudan family connections alleged in the SOR: (1) his \nson, four brothers, and two sisters are citizens and residents of Sudan; and (2) he \nprovided financial support to his brother, sister, and son who are citizens of Sudan. \nApplicant did not have sufficient connections with his sisters residing in Sudan to \ncause a security concern. In Applicant\u2019s April 9, 2017 SCA, Applicant said he \ncommunicated with his two sisters quarterly with his most recent communications in \nDecember 2014. At his hearing, he said he has not talked to his sisters for about six years. \nHe said he most recently provided financial support to them in 2009. He is not close \nenough to his sisters in Sudan to cause a security concern. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.e are \nmitigated. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with people living in a foreign country is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his or \nher spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship with \neven one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing \nproblematic visits of that applicant\u2019s father to Iran). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws.

June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-00939 \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002)). \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government are \namong the important considerations that provide context for the other record evidence \nand must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The \ncountry\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-\n02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). \nAnother important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with \nthe United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government coercion \nor inducement.  \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorism causes a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of Sudan \nwith the United States and the situations involving terrorists and insurgents in that country \nplace a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith any family member living in or visiting them do not pose a security risk because of \nthe risks due to terrorists in that country. Applicant should not be placed into a position \nwhere he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and concerns \nabout assisting someone living in or visiting Sudan. \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 \nn. 18 (App. Bd. July 28, 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security \nsignificance: \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on \ntheir prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is whether an \napplicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members in a foreign \ncountry raise security concerns because those ties and contacts create a \npotential vulnerability that a foreign power, [criminals, or terrorists] could \nseek to exploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified \ninformation that an applicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers -- has by virtue of a security clearance. A person may be \nvulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, or through, the person\u2019s \nimmediate family members -- regardless of whether the person\u2019s family \nmembers are prominent or not. \nGuideline B security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, \n2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-\n26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nor in Sudan seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant, his family, or contacts, nevertheless, this future possibility continues to warrant \nconcern. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Sudan has a significant problem \nwith terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in that country \u201ccould be a means through \nwhich Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology \nand who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)). \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with people who are living in Sudan or visiting Sudan \ncreate a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on his family \nliving in that country in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. \nThose relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence \nof Applicant\u2019s relationships with people living in Sudan and has raised the issue of \npotential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply, and \nfurther inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAs indicated in the disqualifying conditions Foreign Influence section, supra, \nApplicant has several relatives who are citizens and residents of Sudan. In 2017, he had \nfrequent contacts with two brothers and his son. His contacts with them increase the risk \nthat they could be targeted to put pressure on Applicant to provide classified information. \nThe Appeal Board has concluded that contact every two months or three months \nconstitutes \u201cfrequent contact\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8. ISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 14, 2016). See also ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) \n(finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not casual and \ninfrequent and stating \u201cThe frequency with which Applicant speaks to his family members \nin Iran does not diminish the strength of his family ties.\u201d). Frequency of contact is not the \nsole determinant of foreign interest security concerns. \u201c[I]nfrequency of contact is not \nnecessarily enough to rebut the presumption an applicant has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her own immediate family as well as his or her spouse\u2019s immediate \nfamily.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-01979 at 4 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). \nAfter he completed his SCA and counterintelligence interview in 2017, Applicant \ngreatly reduced or stopped his communications with his brothers and son. He said he has \nnot provided any financial support to family members, except possibly his son, for more \nthan 10 years, and not to his son for several years. His previous financial support to his \nbrother, and to his son support the concern that he had a relationship with them, and \nthere is insufficient evidence that he no longer cares about them. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that Applicant frequently traveled to Sudan and \nthat he is married to a woman who is a citizen and resident of Sudan. She has never been \nto the United States. He provided $15,000 in financial support to his spouse. She lives \nwith his uncle.

See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. \n \nBd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR information discussed \nin this paragraph will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above.  \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d His relationship with the United States must be \nweighed against the potential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives \nwho are citizens and residents of Sudan. Applicant has lived in the United States since \n1999, except when he was serving the United States in Iraq from 2007 to 2010 and in \nanother Middle Eastern country since 2016. In 2004, he became a U.S. citizen. He uses \na U.S. passport. He owns a residence in the United States and makes his mortgage \npayments. He votes in U.S. elections, and he pays U.S. and local taxes. He has about \n$80,000 in his U.S. retirement and bank accounts. He has had DOD-related employment \nsince 2016. \nApplicant served with U.S. armed forces in Iraq from 2007 to 2010. In 2010 he left \nemployment as a linguist because a rocket hit the building where he lived. It landed next \nto his room, but due to sandbags it did not explode. He has excellent employment, and \nhe contributes to the success of his employer. He has a substantial U.S. income and \ninvestments in the United States. These factors are balanced against his relationships \nwith family in Sudan, and his relatives in Sudan are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and \nhuman rights violations of the Sudan government. Since 1993, the U.S. Secretary of State \nhas designated Sudan as a State Sponsor of Terrorism for supporting international \nterrorist groups. Applicant\u2019s access to classified information could add risk to his relatives \nliving in Sudan. Applicant\u2019s Sudan citizenship was evidently involuntarily renounced when \nhe became a U.S. citizen. There is no allegation that he would choose to help the Sudan \nGovernment against the interests of the United States. The concern here pertains to the \nrisk to his relatives living in Sudan and does not relate to his loyalty or patriotism to the \nUnited States. \nApplicant has not rebutted the concern arising from his relationships with his son, \nhis two brothers who are all residents of Sudan. While he reduced or ended his \ncommunications with his brothers and son, his reduction in communications and contacts \nwith them does not prove he no longer cares about their welfare or has ended his affection \nfor them. His connections to the United States, taken together, are insufficient to \novercome the foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n16 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline B are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 60-year-old U.S. citizen employed as a linguist in the Middle East \nsince 2016, who seeks a security clearance. In 1995, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nbusiness studies in Sudan. He immigrated to the United States in 1999, and he became \na U.S. citizen in 2004. He served in Iraq supporting DOD from 2007 to 2010, and he was \nat risk from death or serious injury while serving there. In 2010, he was almost killed in \nIraq when a rocket landed near his residence, but did not explode. \nTwo Army captains described Applicant as an asset to mission accomplishment \nwho is diligent, positive, innovative, and responsible. His program manager said Applicant \nis mature, intelligent, and self-motivated. Their statements support approval of his access \nto classified information. He received a unit coin and certificate of appreciation for his \ncontributions to the success of those units that received his support. \nA Guideline B decision concerning Sudan must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers in that country. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical \nsituation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). Sudan is a dangerous \nplace because of violence from terrorists, and the Sudan government does not respect \nthe full spectrum of human rights. Since 1993, the U.S. Secretary of State has designated \nSudan as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. Sudan continues to be a very dangerous and \nunstable country. While Sudan has shown some improvements in the last three years, \nterrorists continue to threaten the interests of the United States, and those who cooperate \nand assist the United States. \nFrom 2009 to 2021, Applicant traveled to Sudan six times. Four of his stays were \nover 30 days. His most recent visit was in 2019, when he married his spouse. He is \nsufficiently close to two brothers and his son to cause a security concern. These three \nrelatives are citizens and residents of Sudan. None of them are citizens of the United \nStates. Applicant did not meet his burden of showing that these three relatives are unlikely \n17 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nto come to the attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. classified information. \n\u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an \nacknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that \ncould be important to a loved one, such as a family member.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-01979 \nat 5 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant refuted the personal \nconduct and financial considerations allegations; however, he failed to mitigate foreign \ninfluence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline B:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.c and 3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n18 \n",

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 12, 2020, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on February 4, 2021. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nFebruary 4, 2021, scheduling the hearing for February 26, 2021. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3, which \nwere admitted without objection, and Hearing Exhibits (HXs) I and II for Administrative \nNotice.

Department Counsel provided an \neight-page summary of the facts, supported by 19 Government documents pertaining to \nIran, identified as HE I. The documents provide elaboration and context for the \nsummary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government \nreports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable \ndispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied all four SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 5.) \nHe has been employed with the defense contractor since 2019. He does not hold a \nsecurity clearance. (TR at page 26 lines 7~21.) He is married to a U.S. citizen, and has \none child, age nine. (TR at page 24 line 22 to page 25 line 12, and at page 29 line 23 to \npage 30 line 4.) \n \n \nApplicant left Iran in 1994. (TR at page 13 lines 11~14.) He first went to Turkey, \nthen to Germany, and finally to the United States in 2003. (TR at page 16 line 19 to \npage 17 line 18.) He later received a bachelor\u2019s degree from an American university. \n(TR at page 17 lines 14~21.) He is a Christian; and as such, was treated like a \u201cthird \nclass citizen\u201d in Iran. (TR at page 14 line 6 to page 15 line 4.) \n \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n1.a. Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Iran.

(TR at page 21 line 23 to page 22 line 13.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Iran.

Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Iran. \nShe \u201cused to work\u201d in the field of agriculture, and he is retired from a company that \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmade cement. Applicant has not contacted his in-laws in four or five years. (TR at page \n23 line 6 to page 24 line 21.) \nNotice \nI take administrative notice of the following: Iran is an authoritarian theocratic \nrepublic with a Shia Islamic political system. Iran has been designated as a State \nSponsor of Terrorism since 1984. In the past, the Iranian government has spent as \nmuch as $700 million per year to support terrorist groups. Subject to certain limited \nexceptions, citizens of Iran are currently barred from entry into the United States. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s parents, sibling and in-laws are citizens and residents of Iran. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant has very little contact with his Iranian, Christian family, none of whom \nhave any connection with the Iranian government. At most, he contacts his mother a \ncouple of times a year. Applicant has lived in the United States for the last 18 years, \nwhere both his American wife and nine-year-old son reside. Foreign Influence is found \nfor Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a distinguished history of working in the defense industry and is \nrespected by those who know him in the workplace. (AppX A at pages 1~5.) He \nperforms well at his job. (AppX A at pages 6 and 7.) Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence \nsecurity concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified an August 2017 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (security clearance application or SCA) by denying an inquiry into whether she failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required within the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a).

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/13/2021 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant and her estranged spouse owe approximately $70,875 in delinquent \nFederal income taxes for tax years 2013 and 2014 and some $25,000 in past-due state \nincome taxes. Her spouse handled their income tax returns and filed them jointly. Applicant \nwas unaware of any income tax delinquency when she completed her security clearance \napplication (SCA) in August 2017, so the personal conduct security concern was not \nestablished. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated because neither \nApplicant nor her spouse have taken any steps to address their Federal income tax \ndelinquency. Clearance eligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 28, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The SOR \nexplained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for her. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive);  \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant submitted an undated response to the SOR and requested a decision \nbased on the written record. On September 23, 2020, she requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nOctober 8, 2020, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On October 23, 2020, Applicant waived the 15-day advance notice of the hearing \nrequired under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive. On October 26, 2020, I scheduled a hearing for \nNovember 5, 2020. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel appeared by video \nteleconference, and Applicant appeared in person. At the hearing, six Government exhibits \n(GEs 1-4, GE 6-7) were admitted in the record without any objections. I withheld ruling on \nthe admissibility of a February 2020 credit report (GE 5), pending submission by the \nGovernment of a complete copy. Applicant offered one exhibit, which was accepted into the \nrecord as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. She testified at the hearing, as reflected in a transcript \n(Tr.) received on November 16, 2020. At the request of the Government and without any \nobjection from Applicant, the SOR was amended under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17 based on \nApplicant\u2019s testimony to add an allegation under Guideline F, as follows: \nb. You are indebted to the state of [name omitted] in the approximate amount \nof $25,000 for delinquent income taxes. \nOn November 5, 2020, Department Counsel submitted a complete copy of GE 5, \nwhich was accepted into the record without any objection. I held the record open to \nNovember 27, 2020, for Applicant to submit additional exhibits. On November 9, 2020, \nApplicant submitted a letter from her state\u2019s division of taxation, which was accepted into \nthe record as AE B without objection on November 12, 2020. No additional documents \nwere received by the November 27, 2020 deadline for further evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nThe amended SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owes $70,875 in \ndelinquent Federal income taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and approximately $25,000 in delinquent \nstate income taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have \ndeliberately falsified an August 2017 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(security clearance application or SCA) by denying an inquiry into whether she failed to file \nor pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required within the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nApplicant admits the tax delinquencies but asserts that her husband handled their returns, \nand she had \u201cno idea, until this process, that [they] had a problem.\u201d She stated in response \nto the SOR that her husband told her \u201cthe tax debt is due [to] his business.\u201d Applicant \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ndenies that she intentionally falsified her SCA, as she \u201canswered what [she] knew to be \ntrue\u201d at that time. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 71-year-old secretary with a high school education. (GE 1; Tr. 30.) She \nhas worked for a succession of defense contractors in support of the U.S. Navy since 1983, \nstaying on in her job as the contract changed hands every five years.  She seeks to retain a \nsecret clearance, which she has held since 1983. (Tr. 58.) Her clearance was last renewed \nin July 2007. When the contract changed in October 2007, the Navy attested to Applicant \nbeing \u201cboth an exemplary employee and a wonderful person.\u201d Her contributions reportedly \nwent beyond those required in the current or previous contract. The letter was signed by \nthe department\u2019s director of contracts and by 47 of her co-workers. (AE A.) Applicant has \nworked for her current employer since October 2016, when the company acquired the \ncontract on the Navy base. (GE 1; Tr. 49-51.) She testified that all of her work, which \ninvolves data entry, is unclassified. (Tr. 50-51.) \nApplicant and her spouse have been married since July 1968. They purchased a \nhome together in October 1992, and have a son age 49 and a daughter age 47. (GE 1.) \nApplicant and her spouse have never legally separated, despite a \u201crocky\u201d relationship over \nthe last 20 years. \u201cA good couple [of] times a year,\u201d she would move in with her daughter \nfor weeks or even a couple of months and then return to her husband. She and her spouse \nkept separate bedrooms when they were in the same household. (Tr. 25, 30-32.) Applicant \nhas not lived with her spouse since June 2019. (Tr. 32.) \n \nApplicant and her spouse have always maintained separate finances, and they paid \ntheir own bills. (GE 4; Tr. 31.) He took care of the house. (Tr. 31.) They have never had a \njoint bank account. (Tr. 26.) Her spouse retired from a job on the base at age 55. (Tr. 49.) \nHe is now age 71. (GE 1.) He has a dog-breeding business in which Applicant is not \ninvolved, and she is not aware of the details of his finances, including his debts or his \nexpenses. (GE 4; Tr. 63-64.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse filed their income tax returns as married filing jointly. He filed \nthem electronically in recent years and did not inform Applicant that they had any issues \nwith their taxes. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 33.) For the earlier years when they filed paper returns, her \nspouse told her to \u201csign here,\u201d and she did not review the returns before they were \nsubmitted. Applicant assumed her spouse was doing the right thing and that they were \u201call \nset\u201d with respect to the taxes. She never asked to see any documents regarding the taxes. \nHe kept any refunds they received. (Tr. 39-40.) \n \n \nApplicant and her spouse were issued refunds of $9,344 in Federal income taxes for \ntax year 2013 and $10,919 for tax year 2014. In April 2016, the IRS examined their returns \nfor both years. The IRS assessed additional taxes of $29,308 for 2013 and $26,919 for \n2014; tax penalties of $5,861 for 2013 and $5,383 for 2014; and interest of $2,175 for 2013 \nand $980 for 2014. Their refund for tax year 2015 was applied to reduce their tax debt for \n2013 by $7,615 in April 2016. In September 2016, the IRS issued a notice of intent to levy \nfor tax year 2013, which was refused or unclaimed. In November 2016, the IRS issued a \n3 \n\n \n \n \nnotice of intent to levy for tax year 2014, which was signed for by someone other than \nApplicant, likely Applicant\u2019s spouse. On April 15, 2017, the IRS intercepted their income tax \nrefund of $7,335 for tax year 2016 and applied it to their tax liability for 2013. On May 1, \n2017, the IRS issued a first levy for tax year 2013. The levy was likely on social security \nbenefits of Applicant\u2019s spouse, given the IRS records show a final notice on November 28, \n2016, \u201cbefore levy on social security benefits.\u201d (GE 3.) \n \nOn August 17, 2017, Applicant completed an SCA to update her security clearance \neligibility. She responded negatively to all of the financial record inquiries on the SCA, \nincluding the following: \u201cIn the past seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, \nstate, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?\u201d (GE 1.) \n \n \nAs of November 2017, Applicant and her spouse\u2019s joint mortgage on their marital \nhome was $21,232 past due on a balance of $281,759. Applicant had no other adverse \ncredit accounts on her credit report. (GE 7.) On August 7, 2018, Applicant was interviewed \nby an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant \nreported that she and her spouse separated in June 2018, and she moved in temporarily \nwith their daughter. When questioned about her finances, she did not dispute the \ndelinquent mortgage, but she was unaware of it because her spouse handled the \nmortgage. Applicant described her finances as good. (GE 2.) \n \n \nThe mortgage on the marital home was listed as $26,313 past due as of March \n2019. (GE 6.) On April 23, 2019, their lender foreclosed on the mortgage. (GE 4.) On May \n22, 2019, Applicant responded to financial interrogatories from the DOD CAF. She provided \ndocumentation showing that she and her spouse had a zero principal balance on the \nmortgage loan because of the foreclosure. In response to an inquiry into whether there \nwere any additional delinquent accounts, Applicant answered affirmatively and listed an \nunpaid Federal tax delinquency of $68,785. She disclosed that no payment arrangements \nhad been made, and she stated in part: \n \n \nMy husband always took care of filing our taxes. I knew there was a problem \na few years back, but it was about his business . . . . My name is not on the \nbusiness at all. Through this process, I found out how much we owe. It is a \nsmall business that he runs at home. He says he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, \nbut I guess interest is being added. I have been told that there are tax relief \nprograms, and I am going to look into them. (GE 4.) \n \nApplicant clarified at her hearing that the \u201cproblem\u201d had to do with her spouse\u2019s \nbusiness. Applicant testified that she overheard him discussing an issue about his \nbusiness. She denied knowing about any tax problem. (Tr. 34.) Applicant learned about the \ntax debt in approximately May 2019, when she contacted the IRS so that she could \nrespond to DOD CAF interrogatories. (Tr. 34-35, 61.) She was told by the IRS that she \ncould file as an innocent spouse. She had not done so because she \u201cjust didn\u2019t want \ntrouble.\u201d (Tr. 61.) \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn January 21, 2020, in response to interrogatories, Applicant provided DOHA with \nIRS account transcripts for tax years 2013 through 2018. The IRS had taken her and her \nspouse\u2019s income tax refunds of $5,030 for 2017 and $1,130 for 2018 and applied them to \ntheir outstanding tax liability for 2013. Their Federal income tax delinquency totaled \n$70,875 ($24,534 for 2013 and $46,341 for 2014), and they were not in a payment plan to \naddress the debt. They had no outstanding Federal tax liability for tax years 2015 through \n2018. In response to an inquiry into whether she owed any outstanding state taxes, \nApplicant responded that, to her knowledge, she did not owe state taxes. She requested \ntax transcripts from the state but had not received a response. Applicant provided the \nfollowing additional information for consideration in determining her security clearance \neligibility: \nI have been working here, at the same place for 36 years. I have never been \nin trouble, or have done anything wrong. I am 70 years old and have never \ndone the taxes. They were always done by my husband. I need this job to \npay my bills. (GE 3.) \n \nIn early to mid February 2020, Applicant received a notice at her current address \nthat the state intended to garnish her wages to collect her and her spouse\u2019s joint tax \ndelinquency of $25,000. She does not know for which year or years the taxes are owed. \n(Tr. 40-41.) Information from the state concerning the levy (AE B) does not reflect the tax \nyear(s) in question. Applicant asserts that she was \u201cin shock\u201d when she learned about the \ntax debt because she had asked her spouse if they owed state income taxes, and he told \nher no. She denies ever seeing any notices, as her husband got the mail and \u201cleft [her] in \nthe dark.\u201d (Answer; Tr. 38.) He apparently has had a girlfriend since 2000 and made sure \nthat Applicant \u201cdid not see a lot of things,\u201d including the telephone bills. (Tr. 38.) The same \nday Applicant received the notice that the state intended to attach her wages, she \ncontacted the state\u2019s tax division, which agreed to lower the garnishment amount to $150 \nper pay period. That amount is less than the maximum allowable levy. (Answer; AE B; Tr. \n41-43.) She has been repaying the state income taxes from her pay since then. (Tr. 25-26.) \nHer spouse is not paying anything towards their state or Federal tax delinquencies. (Tr. 25, \n41.) Applicant testified that she \u201ckeep[s] begging him to just try and do something with the \nfederal [taxes], and he hasn\u2019t.\u201d (Tr. 25.) They are not currently living together, and she has \nnot talked to him recently, but when she brought it to his attention in the past, he told her he \nwould take care of it. (Tr. 26-27.) \n \n \nApplicant filed her own income tax returns for 2019. She owed $577 in Federal \nincome taxes, which she paid when she submitted her return. Her state income tax refund \nof approximately $477 was taken by the state. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant has not contacted the \nIRS about establishing an installment agreement to repay the Federal income tax \ndelinquency of approximately $70,875. She asked the IRS to remove her name from the \ndebt but was denied. She wanted her spouse to take care of the debt because it was not \nher fault, and she does not have much money. (Tr. 45-46, 54.) At her hearing, she \nindicated that she would contact the IRS. (Tr. 54.) Despite the record being held open after \nher hearing, she presented no evidence of having done so. \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \nApplicant earns about $50,000 a year. (Tr. 48.) She testified that she has about \n$300 in discretionary income every month after she pays her recurring expenses. (Tr. 53.) \nShe has about $2,000 in her checking account as of November 2020 because she was \npaid for her unused leave time. (Tr. 63.) As of January 2020, Applicant owed $28,914 in \nrevolving credit on six credit-card accounts. She was making payments on terms \nacceptable to the creditors. The only negative credit entry on her credit report was the \nmortgage loan, which had a zero balance after foreclosure. (GE 5.)  \n \n                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nApplicant and her estranged spouse owed $70,875 in delinquent Federal income \ntaxes for tax years 2013 and 2014 as of January 2020. The current balance is likely higher, \ngiven the continuing accrual of penalties and interest on the unpaid balance. They also \nowed around $25,000 in past-due state income taxes. The record does not show the tax \nyears owed or the current tax balance. Applicant testified credibly that her wages have \nbeen garnished at $150 every two weeks since April 2020 in repayment, so she had paid \naround $2,250 toward the state tax debt as of her hearing. Her state income tax refund of \n$477 for tax year 2019 was taken by the state and applied to the state income tax \ndelinquency. Applicant did not intend to evade paying taxes, as the evidence shows that \nshe relied on her spouse to file their returns, and he did not inform her about any \noutstanding tax liabilities. Nevertheless, she is legally liable for the taxes owed on the joint \nreturns her spouse filed for them. Guideline F security concerns are established because of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe sizeable Federal and state income tax delinquencies. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19 (f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax as required,\u201d clearly apply. \nAG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d has \nsome applicability as well, even though the tax delinquencies were incurred without her \nknowledge. Applicant has known since about the Federal tax debt since May 2019 and \ndone little to resolve it apart from an initial contact with the IRS, who refused to remove her \nname from the debt. She did not follow up on a suggestion from the IRS that she file an \ninnocent spouse form, explaining that she did not want \u201ctrouble.\u201d She stated at her \nNovember 2020 hearing that she would contact the IRS, but she presented no evidence of \nhaving done so. Even so, this case is primarily one of an inability to repay the debt rather \nan unwillingness to do so. Her annual income from her employment of $50,000, from which \nshe is repaying the state income tax delinquency at $150 each pay period. \nApplicant has the burden of establishing sufficient mitigation to overcome the \nfinancial concerns raised by such sizeable income tax delinquencies. Regarding possible \nmitigation under the AGs, one or more of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply \nin whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply, even though the tax debts were incurred some \ntime ago. The Federal tax underpayments (and likely the state as well) are for tax years \n2013 and 2014. IRS account transcripts show that the Federal tax underpayments were \nassessed on examination of the returns in April 2016. In all fairness to Applicant, she was \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nunaware of any outstanding tax liabilities before she contacted the IRS in May 2019 so that \nshe could respond to DOD CAF interrogatories. However, the tax debts are considered \nrecent because they remain unpaid. Applicant\u2019s ongoing failure to address her and her \nspouse\u2019s Federal income tax delinquency continues to cast doubt on her judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. While Applicant could reasonably rely on her \nspouse to handle the preparation of their joint income tax returns, this did not relieve her of \nthe responsibility to review the returns before she signed them. It was her choice not to \nreview them. There is no showing that she questioned her spouse about items on their \nreturns prior to their filing, so she accepted the risk of any errors on the returns. After she \nlearned of the Federal income tax delinquency, it was irresponsible of her to continue to \nrely on her spouse to address their tax debt, given his demonstrated unreliability in that \nregard. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and to a lesser extent AG \u00b6 20(d) have some applicability to the state \nincome tax delinquency. While payments in response to a state levy or garnishment are not \npayments initiated by Applicant and do not trigger AG \u00b6 20(d), she is credited with \ncontacting the state tax division as soon as she learned about the state\u2019s intent to garnish \nher wages for the state tax debt. Approximately $2,250 has been paid from her wages for \nthe delinquent state income tax debt since April 2020. The state taxes are being repaid \nunder terms acceptable to the state tax division, and a favorable finding is warranted on \nthat basis as to the state income tax debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b). However, neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \n\u00b6 20(d) applies to the larger Federal income tax delinquency. \nOn learning about the Federal tax delinquency, Applicant asked the IRS to hold her \nspouse solely liable. She was advised that she was jointly liable for the tax debts, but she \nwas also told that she could file a form for spousal relief, which she has not done. \nIRS publication 971 regarding relief for innocent spouses makes it clear that married \ncouples filing jointly are jointly and severally liable for the entire tax liability under Federal \nlaw. Joint and several liability applies not only to the tax liability shown on the tax return, but \nalso to any additional tax liability the IRS determines to be due, even if the additional tax is \nbecause of income, deductions, or credits of the spouse. The IRS can collect the tax debt \neven in the case of divorce. In some cases, a spouse will be relieved of the tax, interest, \nand penalties on a joint tax return. Three types of relief are available to married persons \nwho filed joint returns: innocent spouse relief; separation of liability relief; and equitable \nrelief. To seek relief on the basis of innocent spouse, the required Form 8857 must be filed \nno later than two years after the date on which the IRS first attempted to collect the tax. A \ncollection activity, such as an IRS issuance of a notice of intent to levy, can start the two-\nyear period within which the 8857 must be filed. By law, the IRS has to contact the spouse \nof a person claiming innocent spouse relief. Innocent spouse relief relieves one from paying \nthe tax, interest, and penalties if his or her spouse improperly reported items or omitted \nitems from the tax return. \nTo qualify as an innocent spouse, an individual must have filed a joint return; there is \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nan understated tax on the return due to erroneous items of one\u2019s spouse; the individual \nclaiming relief can show that when he or she signed the joint return, he or she did not know \nand had no reason to know that the understated tax existed or the extent to which the \nunderstated tax existed; and it would be unfair to hold the individual liable for the \nunderstated tax. An understated tax exists if the IRS determined that the total tax should be \nmore than the amount shown on the joint return. In determining whether an individual had \nreason to know of the understated tax (i.e., unreported spousal income or incorrect \ndeduction, credit, or property basis), the IRS will consider all of the facts and \ncircumstances, including the nature of the erroneous item claimed; the financial situations \nof the respective spouses; the educational background and business experience of the \nspouse claiming innocent spouse relief; the extent to which the spouse claiming relief \nparticipated in the activity that resulted in the erroneous item; whether the spouse claiming \nrelief failed to ask, at or before the return was signed, about items on the return or omitted \nfrom the return that a reasonable person would question; and whether the erroneous item \nrepresented a significant departure from a recurring pattern reflected on prior years\u2019 \nreturns. See www.irs.gov. Applicant did not follow up and file for such relief because she \ndid not want to cause trouble, although she was not specific about the consequences she \nfeared if she filed. \nApplicant has taken no steps that would alleviate security concerns raised by the \nburden of the $70,875 Federal income tax delinquency. She indicated in May 2019 that she \nwould look into tax relief programs. There is no evidence that she did so, apparently \nbecause she was afraid to start it. At her hearing, she testified that she would contact the \nIRS about the Federal income tax delinquency. I held the record open for three weeks after \nthe hearing, and she presented no evidence of any recent contacts with the IRS, either to \nfile as an innocent spouse or to inquire about an installment plan to make payments. It is \nnot enough in mitigation for Applicant to simply assert that the tax debt was not her fault. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are not fully mitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified her August 2017 SCA when \nshe responded negatively to an inquiry concerning whether she owed any Federal or state \ntaxes in the last seven years. The evidence shows that the IRS reviewed her and her \nspouse\u2019s joint tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014 on April 11, 2016, and assessed \nadditional taxes, penalties, and interest totaling $37,344 for 2013 and $33,282 for 2014. A \nnotice of intent to levy was issued and signed for in November 2016. The objective \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence of delinquency shows that the debt should have been listed on her August 2017 \nSCA. However, Applicant has consistently denied any intentional falsification, claiming that \nshe did not know about the tax debts because her spouse handled their returns, and he \nkept the information from her. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, \nstating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence \nto explain the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, \n2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \nApplicant was unaware of the Federal tax delinquency before she contacted the IRS \nto respond to DOD CAF interrogatories in May 2019. She did not learn of the state income \ntax delinquency until the state notified her of its intention to garnish her wages in early \n2020. Whereas Applicant was unaware of the tax debts when she completed her SCA in \nAugust 2017, the personal conduct security concern was not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analyses under Guidelines F and E are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant\u2019s dedication to her work \nwith a defense contractor is unassailable, and there is no indication that she has exercised \npoor judgment on the job. She failed to review her and her spouse\u2019s joint income tax filings, \nalthough even if she had done so, it is not clear that she would have recognized an error on \nhe returns or received the truth from her spouse if she expressed any concerns. It is not \nsurprising that she was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn in 2019 about the Federal income tax \ndelinquency and in 2020 about the state income tax delinquency. She demonstrated some \nunderstanding that she made a serious error in judgment by continuing to rely on her \nspouse to take care of their Federal tax debt. She filed her tax returns for 2019 on her own \nand paid the taxes owed. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, Applicant has also exhibited an unacceptable tendency to ignore \nsignificant issues once they became known to her, such as the Federal tax delinquency for \n2013 and 2014. While she may not have known what to do or she feared the consequences \nof taking action, the Government must be assured that persons granted security clearance \neligibility can be relied on to comply with such an important obligation as filing income tax \nreturns and paying taxes owed. Applicant\u2019s ongoing inattention to such a large Federal \nincome tax delinquency is without adequate justification. The Appeal Board has repeatedly \nheld that the government need not wait until an applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard \nclassified information before denying or revoking security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, \n238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). Based on the evidence, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility at this time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

(Answer Encl. 3) Her admissions and other \ncomments are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. She was born and raised in Thailand. She earned her \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2000 from a Thai university. She then came to the United States to \nfurther her education. She studied for two years at a state university in the United \nStates, earning a master\u2019s degree in May 2003. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 22, 70, 74-75). \nFrom November 2003 to January 2009, Applicant worked at a Thai diplomatic \nfacility (Thai DF 1) in the United States. She worked in consular affairs and then as an \nassistant to a senior Thai diplomat. (GE 1; Tr. 22, 32, 83-84)(SOR \u00b6 1.e) She is no \nlonger in touch with anyone she worked with there. (Tr. 84, 96-97) \nApplicant then returned to Thailand. After a brief period of unemployment, she \nbegan working in August 2009 as a local employee at a U.S. diplomatic post in Thailand \nas an immigrant visa assistant. (GE 1; Tr. 22-23, 33, 71) She testified that the work \ninvolved \u201cvery sensitive\u201d personal information and she knew not to discuss it. (Tr. 72) \nApplicant remained in that job until February 2012, when she moved to the \nUnited States to marry her husband. They met in 2010 when he was a U.S. Foreign \nService officer serving in Thailand. They married in February 2012. They have lived in \nthe United States ever since, with her husband\u2019s three children from a prior marriage. \n(GE 1; Tr. 74; AE E-F) \nAfter immigrating to the United States, Applicant was unemployed while awaiting \na green card (November 2012) and work visa (November 2013, est.). She then worked \nas an assistant at another Thai diplomatic facility in the United States. (Thai DF 2). \nApplicant testified that she was considered a \u201clocal employee,\u201d and was not an \nemployee of the Thai Foreign Service. (Tr. 34-36) She was involved in visa applications \nand protocol. (GE 1; Tr. 83-85, 102-103) She said she applied for the job because she \nthought she might get hired due to her prior work at Thai DF 1. (Tr. 100-101) She \nworked there from November 2013 to January 2018. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in July 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 73) She holds a valid \nU.S. passport, issued a month later. Since then, she has only used a U.S. passport to \ntravel. (Tr. 76) Her Thai passport expired in 2019. (GE 1) She accepts no benefits from \nbeing a Thai citizen and has no plans to return to Thailand permanently. (Tr. 76) \nApplicant submitted her SCA in November 2017, in connection with a job offer for \na cleared position with a State Department contractor. She worked in a passport \nissuance office at the State Department for about 18 months until her interim clearance \nwas withdrawn (likely due to the SOR). Applicant described herself as a hard worker. \nShe never discusses the sensitive or classified information she handled. She remains \nsponsored for the position.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) Her father \nis 89 and has been retired for many years. Applicant\u2019s mother is 75. She worked for \nmany years as a secretary for a car dealer. Her longtime boss is elderly and retired, and \nApplicant\u2019s mother is his caregiver and financial manager. (Tr. 77-78) Applicant has \nregular phone calls with her parents and frequent text messages with her mother. (Tr. \n23-24, 78) Her conversations with her father are brief because he is in mental decline. \nHer parents do not really know or understand what Applicant does for a living. (Tr. 78-\n80) Applicant and her husband do not provide her parents financial support.

She was also briefed on what \nto do if she was approached by someone outside the facility, and she was to report any \nsuch contacts to the diplomatic security office. (Tr. 118-121) \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers also remain in Thailand. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) One brother is a \nformer professor. He owns a small resort. They are in contact several times a year. The \nother brother is unemployed. Applicant has little contact with him. They are not aware of \nwhat she does for a living. (Tr. 80-82, 101) Applicant has returned to Thailand for family \nvisits five times since 2012, most recently in 2019. (Tr. 76, 92-96) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant maintains contact with \u201cfriends and former \ncoworkers who are citizens and residents of Thailand.\u201d This includes former co-workers \nat the U.S. diplomatic facility in Thailand, whom she sees on return visits there. (Tr. 27, \n38-42) She is friends with one local person in the United States. that she worked with at \nThai DF 2. They share an interest in food and do not discuss work or politics. (Tr. 38, \n82-83, 85, 98, 105-106) She remains friends with one Thai diplomat she knew from that \njob, a person who is now posted overseas. They are in regular, frequent contact. (Tr. \n104-105) Applicant maintains no other regular, ongoing contact with any Thai diplomats \nshe has worked with in the past. (Tr. 96-100, 105-106) \nApplicant testified, \u201cThe U.S. is my home. I love this country. And my family is \nhere. In total, I have lived here for 17 years of my life. And the day I became a U.S. \ncitizen was one of the proudest days of my life.\u201d (Tr. 85, 91) Her dream job is to work for \nthe U.S. Government. (Tr. 85-86) She has not voted in Thailand since becoming a U.S. \ncitizen. (Tr. 86) Applicant testified that she would report to authorities if she were ever \napproached for information. (Tr. 87) \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified as a character witness. They met in early 2010 \nwhen he was posted to Thailand as a cleared U.S. Foreign Service officer, while on \nsabbatical from law practice. They did not work together but he was aware of her duties. \n(Tr. 17-18) He returned to the United States later that year. They kept in touch and their \nromance blossomed. Applicant came to the United States on a fianc\u00e9e visa (K-1) in \nFebruary 2012, and they married soon after. (Tr. 19-21, 31; AE D) \nApplicant\u2019s husband is now counsel at a large law firm. (Tr. 27-28) Applicant is a \nloving and caring stepmother to his three teenage children.

(Tr. 24-25, 86-88, 108; AE F) Applicant has many \nfriends in the United States and in her local community. (Tr. 24, 88) \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified that the day Applicant became a U.S. citizen was \none of the proudest days of her life, as well as his own. He also noted her pride and joy \nin voting in the United States for the first time. He said she is a proud and loyal U.S. \ncitizen. (Tr. 25-26) \n \nThree other character witnesses (W1, W2, W3) testified by phone. W1 is a reti\n \nred \nU.S. Foreign Service officer who retired to Thailand. He met and hired Applicant at the \nU.S. diplomatic post there and was one of her supervisors. He noted that consular and \nvisa work involves sensitive and personal information, including medical information. \nApplicant was very reliable in handling that information. He trusted her judgment and \ndiscretion, and said she was very dedicated to her job. He is aware of her prior and \nsubsequent work at the Thai DFs in the U.S. He also noted that many Thai citizens \nhave married U.S. diplomats and become U.S. citizens as well as cleared State \nDepartment employees to do consular and visa work. (Tr. 45-51; AE D)  \nAn example of such a person is W2. She was born in Thailand. She came to the \nUnited States in 2000 and has been a U.S. citizen since 2003. She has been a State \nDepartment employee since 2004. She works in human resources and has a clearance. \nShe met Applicant\u2019s husband when they were both posted to Thailand, and met \nApplicant in 2018. She and Applicant are close friends and socialized often (before the \npandemic). W2 described Applicant as a \u201crule follower,\u201d (Tr. 55-56) and a loyal U.S. \ncitizen who is worthy of holding a clearance. (Tr. 53-60; AE D) \nW3 is a cleared State Department contractor. He met Applicant when they \nworked in the same office, in about 2018. They bonded because W3 had travelled to \nThailand. They would socialize in the same group of friends at work. He described \nApplicant as dedicated, honest, hardworking, punctual, and \u201cabove average\u201d in terms of \nclearance suitability. (Tr. 62-68) \nI also considered the reference letters of the character witnesses who testified at \nthe hearing, as well as the letters from those who did not. They all offered similar, and \nstrong, endorsements of Applicant\u2019s character, value to the United States, judgment, \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and overall suitability to hold a clearance. (AE D) \nKingdom of Thailand (Thailand)(AN I) \nThailand is a constitutional monarchy, with the king as head of state. King Rama \nX was crowned in 2019, three years after the death of his father, who ruled for 70 years, \nfrom 1946 until 2016. Thailand is also a parliamentary democracy, with a prime minister \nas head of government. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFrom May 2014 to July 2019, Thailand was governed by a military junta, the \nNational Council for Peace and Order. Following the coup, the United States suspended \nmilitary aid to Thailand. This period saw increased cooperation between Thailand and \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and complicated U.S.-Thai relations. \nThailand has extensive trade and investment relations across the pacific region. \nHistorically, Thailand has close ties with the PRC, and trade has burgeoned under the \n2010 China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. Unlike several of its neighbors, Thailand \nhas no territorial disputes with the PRC in the South China Sea and has been loath to \ntake an assertive stance against China's actions there. As a member of the China-led \nBelt and Road Initiative (BRI), Thailand is involved in a high-speed railway project that \nwould connect southern China with several Southeast Asian nations. \nFollowing democratic elections in Thailand in 2019, U.S. military assistance has \nresumed, and military cooperation has increased. The 2020 Cobra Gold military \nexercise was the largest ever of that annual event. \nThailand has indicated it wants to reset its relationship with the United States.  As \none of Southeast Asia's most developed nations and a long-time U.S. partner on a \nrange of issues, Thailand has the potential to support U.S. initiatives such as \nbroadening regional defense cooperation. However, U.S. policymakers face challenges \nin rekindling the relationship while encouraging Thailand to fully return to democratic \nnorms. Among U.S. concerns are the Thai government's continued efforts to suppress \ncriticism, including muzzling journalists and banning one of the largest opposition \nparties, as well as other human rights issues. \nWhile AN I details instances of domestic terrorism, Thailand experienced no \nattacks attributed to transnational terrorist groups in 2019, and violence was restricted \nto attacks attributed to ethno-nationalist insurgents in the country's restive southern \nregion. \nAccording to a March 1, 2021 travel advisory, the State Department urges U.S. \ncitizens to reconsider travel to Thailand (Level 3) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The \nsame advisory notes that Thai borders currently remain closed for all foreign nationals, \nwith few exceptions. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. It denotes a risk \ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \ngovernment or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s family \nties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nApplicant\u2019s parents and two brothers are citizens and residents of Thailand. The \npolitical and governmental turmoil in Thailand in recent years, as well as Thailand\u2019s \nregional proximity to the PRC are sufficient to establish a \u201cheightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d In addition, Applicant\u2019s \npast employment at Thai diplomatic facilities establishes a prima facie case for \nheightened risk as well. Applicant\u2019s family and professional connections to Thailand also \ncreate a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the \nevidence. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant maintains contact with \u201cfriends and former \ncoworkers who are citizens are residents of Thailand.\u201d No specific person is identified, \nand without more detail, such friendships and contacts are not disqualifying. The only \npeople in Thailand outside of Applicant\u2019s family with whom she maintains even casual \ncontact are former local employees she worked with at the U.S. diplomatic post. Their \nemployment status precludes a finding that Applicant\u2019s contact with them would be \ndisqualifying. She also maintains contact with one current Thai diplomat she used to \nwork with in the United States (now stationed elsewhere), and one other employee of \nThai DF 2, in the United States. They might be covered in SOR \u00b6 1.e, but are not \ncovered in SOR \u00b6 1.d. SOR \u00b6 1.d is found for Applicant, as no disqualifying conditions \napply.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have analyzed the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 8 and conclude the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nUnderstandably, Applicant has frequent contact with her parents, and fairly \nregular, though less frequent, contact with one brother. She has limited contact with her \nsecond brother. It cannot be said that her relationships with her immediate family \nmembers are casual. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply to them. AG \u00b6 8(c) has some \napplicability to the two people Applicant used to work with at Thai DF 2, in the United \nStates. One remains in the area, and they have remained personal friends. Another, a \nThai diplomat, has left the area and now serves overseas, though they remain in \nfrequent, though casual, contact. Particularly given Applicant\u2019s own prior experience as \na local employee at a U.S. diplomatic facility, however, I do not regard either contact as \nbeing of a particularly significant, ongoing security concern. \nApplicant has immediate family members who are citizens and residents of \nThailand. She first came to the United States to further her education, and has lived \nhere for 17 out of the next 20 years. After earning her master\u2019s degree, she worked for \nseveral years at Thai DF 1, in the U.S., before returning to Thailand. She is no longer in \ntouch with anyone she worked with in that job. \nAs a \u201clocal employee\u201d at a U.S. \ndiplomatic post in Thailand, she underwent a background check, and was trained to \nreport suspicious contacts. Even before becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant had \nestablished a familiarity with the concept of acting in the best interests of the United \nStates. \nWhile there, Applicant met her future husband, and they have been married since \nshe came to the United States in 2012. Their life is here, with his three children, for \nwhom Applicant is a loving and supportive stepmother. Once she got a work visa, \nApplicant\u2019s professional experience led to her work as a local employee at Thai DF 2. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant worked as a State Department contractor until \nher interim clearance was withdrawn. She would like to continue this work, which is \nreally a natural progression of both her personal life in the United States and her \nextensive professional and diplomatic life experience. \nApplicant also presented strong whole-person character evidence through her \nwitnesses, all of whom have significant experience in the State Department culture and \nenvironment in which Applicant clearly thrives. Those witnesses conveyed and \ncommunicated their strong trust in Applicant to act in the best interest of the United \nStates. Their testimony and evidence serves to bolster Applicant\u2019s track record of acting \nin that fashion. AG \u00b6 8(a) and AG \u00b6 8(b) apply, as Applicant\u2019s ties to the United States \nare significant to overcome any conflict of interest with Thailand and any heightened risk \nestablished by her contacts there. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor while \nshe testified. Applicant was an impressive and candid witness. Applicant presented a \nstrong case in mitigation and in support of her request for access to classified \ninformation. I also found her witnesses highly credible, and give significant weight to \ntheir testimony and their State Department backgrounds. After carefully weighing the \nevidence, both favorable and unfavorable, and considering the whole-person factors set \nforth in AG \u00b6 2(d), the foreign influence security concerns about Applicant\u2019s family \nconnections to Thailand are mitigated through the strong evidence of Applicant\u2019s prior \nservice to the U.S. Government, her long and well-established family ties to the United \nStates, and her strong whole-person character witness evidence. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThe record evidence therefore leaves me with no questions or doubts as to her \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

He is married and has two children. He has two years \nof community college and four years of trade school. He is employed by a defense \ncontractor as a Quality Assurance Technician for Aircraft Production. He is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.   \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct, drug abuse, and dishonesty, \nevidenced by numerous arrests and Felony convictions spanning most of his adult life. \n(Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.) He began working for his current employer in \nOctober 2017. (Government Exhibit 1). He has never applied for a security clearance \nbefore, and has no military service. Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth \nin the SOR. \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2002. He went on to school for auto \nmechanics and briefly worked in the field. He then went to work for a beer distribution \nwarehouse. While employed there, in late August 2006, Applicant was involved in an \nelaborate robbery scheme where he and his friends stole 1.25 million dollars. \nApplicant testified that he and four friends robbed an armored truck. Two of \nApplicant\u2019s friends worked for the armored truck company. Applicant explained that he \nand his friends got uniforms from the friend who worked for the company. Applicant\u2019s \nrole in the heist was that of the get-a-way driver, so that he did not wear a uniform. His \ntwo friends went up to the armored truck, knocked on the door, and the doors opened. \nThey went into the vehicle, took a couple of bags of money, and came back to the car.  \nApplicant then drove away. Applicant and his friends were said to have stolen 1.25 \nmillion dollars from the heist. After dividing the money between them, Applicant\u2019s share \nof the proceeds was about a quarter of a million dollars. He bought clothes and a cell \nphone. Applicant was arrested when a private investigator who had been following two \nof his friends around, who worked for the company, traced the robbery back to the \nApplicant. \nApplicant was charged and convicted of Grand Theft: Money, Labor, \nProperty over $400, a Felony. He was sentenced to two years in state prison. He \nactually served 13 months before being released in October 2007, as he was credited \nfor pretrial time served. (Tr. pp.19 - 25.) \nFrom October 2007 to June 2009, Applicant worked as a Lube Technician, \nworking on cars, doing oil changes and the like. He was involved in a motorcycle \naccident and was unemployed until November 2011. During this idle time, Applicant \nand his friends started using methamphetamines. On at least two separate occasions, \nApplicant was arrested for Possessions of a Controlled Substance, and Possession of \nDrug Paraphernalia. \nOn both occasions, Applicant was arrested with friends and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmethamphetamine was confiscated. \nApplicant was actually in the middle of the court \nordered drug program for his first offense, when he was arrested for possession of \nmethamphetamines a second time. (Tr. pp. 30-31.) As a result of these convictions, in \nSeptember 2010, Applicant was placed on an 18-month Deferred Entry of Judgment for \nPossession of a Controlled Substance and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. On \nabout September 24, 2010, Applicant failed to appear for a Deferred Entry of Judgment, \nand a Bench Warrant was issued. On about December 1, 2010, he was sentenced to \none year of active formal probation, fined, and ordered to work with a probation officer in \na plan for substance abuse counseling and service. Applicant claims that he has been \nclean and sober since December 2010. (Tr. pp. 25 - 32.) \nIn \nNovember \n2010, \nApplicant \nwas \ncharged \nand \nconvicted \nof \nPossession/Manufacture/Sell of Dangerous Weapon, a Felony. Applicant explained that \nhe was with some friends when they were pulled over, and brass knuckles were found \nin the Applicant\u2019s backpack. He was sentenced to three years formal probation, and \none day in county jail. (Tr. pp. 31 - 32.) \n \nA few months later, in January 2011, Applicant was charged and convicted of \nForgery, a Felony.  Applicant explained that he was cashing checks that he knew to be \nfraudulent.  He got the checks from a friend of a friend.  Applicant testified that he would \ngo to the banks and cash them like they were payments to him for providing a service of \nsome kind.  Applicant did this at least three times, involving three fraudulent checks.  \nApplicant pled nolo contendere to Second Degree Commercial Burglary and Grand \nTheft of Personal Property.  On or about February 9, 2011, Applicant was sentenced to \ntwo years confinement in state prison and was ordered to pay restitution of $400.  \nApplicant was released early for good behavior, and was given six weeks credit for \ncompleting school and receiving certificates in various computer programs.  (Tr. pp. 33- \n35.) \nApplicant was hired by his current employer in 2017. On November 1, 2017, he \ncompleted a security clearance application. Section 23 of the application asked him, if \nin the last seven years, had he used any illegal drugs or controlled substances? The \nApplicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d Applicant failed to disclose his use of methamphetamines \nfrom January 2010 to December 2010. (Government Exhibit 1.) \nSection 23 of that same application asked the Applicant if in the last seven years, \nhad he been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, cultivation, trafficking, \nproduction, transfer, shipping, handling or sale of any drug or controlled substance? \nApplicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d Applicant failed to disclose that he was arrested on at least \ntwo separate occasions for Possession of Methamphetamines in 2010. (Government \nExhibit 1.) \nApplicant was not truthful when he answered the questions in Section 23, and he \nshould have answered, \u201cYes,\u201d to both questions on the application. Although Applicant \nacknowledged his drug use in the police record section of the application, he explained \nthat the reason he did not disclose it in this section is because he did not want the \nGovernment to think that he was still using drugs when he was not. (Tr. pp. 40 and 42).  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was not truthful here. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate attempt to deceive the \nGovernment is unacceptable and shows immaturity and poor judgment. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matter of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless \nof whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Neither of the conditions are applicable. \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, compliance \nwith the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement \nApplicant\u2019s extensive criminal record demonstrates poor judgment, immaturity \nand a total disregard for the law. Applicant has a number of Felony convictions and has \nspent time in state prison on more than one occasion. His misconduct was extreme, \noutrageous, and inexcusable. Although his last conviction and imprisonment was over \nten years ago, he has not established that he is sufficiently reliable and trustworthy to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccess classified information. \nHis many violations of the law give rise to serious \nconcerns about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, both because of the nature \nof the offenses, and the circumstances surrounding the offenses. \nThe before-\nmentioned disqualifying conditions have been established and are not mitigated. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains two conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nAlthough his drug-related \narrests occurred over ten years ago, and Applicant\u2019s states that his drug abuse has \nstopped, he recently lied about his drug use on his security clearance application. This \nshows immaturity, and an attempt to hide information from the government. It not clear \nfrom the evidence whether he has actually stopped his drug abuse. He has not shown \nthe requisite good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness necessary to be eligible for \naccess to classified information. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a)deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThere are conditions mitigating security concerns under AG \u00b6 17. However, \nnone of them are applicable here. \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant claims that his use and possession of methamphetamines stopped in \nDecember of 2010. However, in answering the questions on his security clearance \napplication regarding this drug use, he lied and denied it. He deliberately failed to \ndisclose his drug use on his security clearance application. \nThis raises serious \nquestions about his credibility. Applicant has not demonstrated that he can be trusted. \nThus, it is not clear whether he has really stopped illegal drug use. In totality, his \nconduct still shows a high degree of immaturity and poor judgment. None of the \nmitigating conditions are applicable here. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, H, and E, in my whole-person analysis. \nBased upon the facts and \nanalysis set forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that he meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Criminal Conduct, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse, and Personal Conduct security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a. and 3.b. \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Taiwan with U.S. permanent residency currently residing in the United States (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that his mother-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.b), brother-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.c), sister-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and three friends (SOR \u00b6 1.e) are resident citizens of Taiwan; and that Applicant maintains 3 contact with two Taiwanese citizens currently serving in Taiwan\u2019s Air Force (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant admitted the allegations, but he also stated that he reported his initial relationship with his spouse as well as their engagement, and marriage to his employer\u2019s security office; that he has limited casual contact and correspondence with his brother-in- law in Taiwan and has no ability to communicate with his mother-in-law and sister-in-law in Taiwan because they do not speak English, and he does not speak Chinese. He explained that the three friends referenced in the SOR are his spouse\u2019s friends, whom he casually met in Taiwan. He denied any current contact with them. As for the two Taiwanese citizens currently serving in Taiwan\u2019s military, Applicant indicated that he communicates with them only on business for his defense-contractor employer.

Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 12, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn August 26, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). Referral of the case to the Hearing Office was delayed because of the \nCOVID pandemic. On February 17, 2021, Department Counsel indicated that the \nGovernment was ready to proceed to a hearing. On February 26, 2021, the case was \nassigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the \ncase assignment and file on March 4, 2021. On March 9, 2021, I informed Applicant of \nthe possibility of an online hearing at his option. Applicant expressed his willingness to \nhave an online video hearing. Following a successful test of the Defense Collaboration \nServices (DCS), on March 12, 2021, DOHA scheduled a DCS video teleconference \nhearing for March 24, 2021. \nAt the hearing, two Government exhibits (GEs 1-2) were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant objected to a third proposed exhibit, a summary of a personal subject \ninterview, for lack of authentication, and it was not accepted into the record on that basis. \nThree hearing exhibits (HEs) were marked for the record but not admitted as evidentiary \nexhibits: a Government request for administrative notice with extracts of the source \ndocuments concerning Taiwan as HE I; a Government request for administrative notice \nwith extracts of the source documents concerning the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) \nas HE II; and an October 15, 2019 letter forwarding copies of the proposed GEs to \nApplicant and the Government\u2019s administrative notice requests as HE III. Two Applicant \nexhibits (AEs A-B) were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant and one \nwitness testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on April 5, 2021. \nAdministrative Notice \nAt the hearing, the Government submitted for administrative notice several facts \npertinent to Taiwan and China, as set forth in respective requests for administrative notice \ndated October 15, 2019. The administrative notice request for Taiwan was based on \nexcerpts of U.S. government publications, including the U.S. State Department\u2019s Fact \nSheet, U.S. Relations with Taiwan, dated August 21, 2018; a November 2018 report to \nCongress by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission; a report of the \nOffice of National Counterintelligence Executive, Report to Congress on Foreign \nEconomic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2009-2011; a publication of the Defense \nPersonnel and Security Research Center; and three summaries and one press release \nof the U.S. Department of Justice about economic espionage benefitting Taiwan. The \nadministrative notice request for China was based on excerpts of U.S. government \npublications, including the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2018 Human Rights Report and its \nInternational Travel Information for China dated January 3, 2019; a Worldwide Threat \nAssessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community dated January 29, 2019; remarks by the \nthen Director of National Intelligence on January 29, 2019; a report of the National \nCounterintelligence and Security Center, Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace \n2018; a report of the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive, Report to Congress \non Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2009-2011; DOD\u2019s annual \nreport to Congress on military and security developments involving China for 2019; two \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsummaries and eight press releases from the U.S. Department of Justice reporting recent \neconomic espionage activity targeting the United States and U.S commercial entities; and \n2016 and 2018 reports to Congress by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \nCommission. \nApplicant submitted for administrative notice Senate Bill 4813 of the 116th  \nCongress 2nd  Session proposing congressional enactment of the Taiwan Relations \nEnforcement Act of 2020. He posited that the Bill seeks to update U.S. policy toward \nTaiwan and strengthen the relationship between the two countries. \nApplicant confirmed that he received the Government\u2019s requests for administrative \nnotice with extracts of the source documents. Applicant objected to the Government\u2019s \nadministrative notice request regarding China on the basis that the foreign influence \nconcerns in his case all relate to Taiwan. The Government objected to taking \nadministrative notice of Senate Bill 4813 in that it represents the opinion of the sponsoring \nsenators and has not been enacted so it is not the official position of the U.S. government. \nPursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political \nconditions in evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007)), I informed the parties of my intention to take administrative notice of the \nfacts requested by the Government with respect to Taiwan and China, subject to the \nreliability of the source documentation and the relevance and materiality of the facts \nproposed. I sustained the Government\u2019s objection to accepting for administrative notice \nSenate Bill 4813 as it has only been proposed and not been enacted as an official position \nof the U.S. government. Both the Government and the Applicant declined the opportunity \nto propose additional facts for administrative notice, including updated facts to show the \ncurrent U.S. administration\u2019s stance toward Taiwan. Accordingly, sua sponte, I note that \nthe U.S. State Department issued a new China travel advisory on December 17, 2020, \nand a recent press release on January 23, 2021. \nConcerning the reports and press releases of criminal activity and export violations \non behalf of China or Taiwan, they were presented by the Government apparently to \nsubstantiate that China and Taiwan engage in espionage against the United States and \nactively pursue collection of U.S. economic and proprietary information. Neither Applicant \nnor his spouse\u2019s family members in Taiwan were implicated in that criminal activity, \nalthough the Government does not have to prove that they were so implicated. With those \ncaveats, and considering the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice and the \nupdated information from the U.S. State Department, the facts administratively noticed \nare set forth below. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Taiwan \nwith U.S. permanent residency currently residing in the United States (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that \nhis mother-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.b), brother-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.c), sister-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and \nthree friends (SOR \u00b6 1.e) are resident citizens of Taiwan; and that Applicant maintains \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ncontact with two Taiwanese citizens currently serving in Taiwan\u2019s Air Force (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \nApplicant admitted the allegations, but he also stated that he reported his initial \nrelationship with his spouse as well as their engagement, and marriage to his employer\u2019s \nsecurity office; that he has limited casual contact and correspondence with his brother-in-\nlaw in Taiwan and has no ability to communicate with his mother-in-law and sister-in-law \nin Taiwan because they do not speak English, and he does not speak Chinese. He \nexplained that the three friends referenced in the SOR are his spouse\u2019s friends, whom he \ncasually met in Taiwan. He denied any current contact with them. As for the two \nTaiwanese citizens currently serving in Taiwan\u2019s military, Applicant indicated that he \ncommunicates with them only on business for his defense-contractor employer. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 60-year-old electrical engineer. A lifelong resident citizen of the \nUnited States, he has worked for the same defense contractor since October 1984 and \nseeks to retain security clearance eligibility, which he has held throughout his \nemployment. In approximately June 1995, he was granted a Top Secret clearance. He \nhas held a Secret clearance since approximately March 2011. His uncontroverted \ntestimony is that he has never committed a security violation. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree earned in about July 1993 and a master\u2019s degree in business administration, \nwhich he earned in April 2004. He has two sons, ages 30 and 25, from his first marriage. \nHis sons are serving in the National Guard and the U.S. Reserve forces, respectively. \n(GE 1; Tr. 43, 47-48.) Applicant\u2019s parents, who are deceased, were native-born citizens \nof the United States. Applicant\u2019s four siblings are U.S. resident citizens. (GE 1.) \nApplicant has traveled frequently to Taiwan on business for his defense-contractor \nemployer since at least April 2014. Some of those business trips between 2015 and 2017 \nrequired extended stays of over 30 days in Taiwan. (GE 1; Tr. 71.) More recent trips to \nTaiwan in April 2018, June 2018, January 2019, late February 2019, April 2019, and \nOctober 2019, were for less than 30 days each. (GE 2; Tr. 45, 73.) Applicant went to \nTaiwan for his work in September 2020 for what he thought would be a brief stay. He \nremained in Taiwan for his employer until December 2020. (Tr. 45, 72.) \nApplicant met his current spouse through an online dating site. He joined the site \nin the United States but viewed her profile for the first time while he was in Taiwan on \nbusiness in July 2015. They began dating shortly thereafter, and he eventually shared \nwith her that he was in Taiwan for his employer. He testified that he held off telling his \nspouse what he does for a living for as long as he possibly could. (Tr. 75.) A native of \nTaiwan, his spouse was educated through college in Taiwan and worked as an \naccountant for a car manufacturer in Taiwan. Applicant and his spouse became engaged \nin March 2016 and cohabited from January 2017 to April 2017, when he was on business \nin Taiwan. (Tr. 49-51, 72-75.) After they were engaged, he informed his spouse that he \nholds a security clearance. (Tr. 77.) In February 2017, Applicant and his spouse had a \ndinner reception in Taiwan to celebrate their upcoming nuptials with her family and \nfriends. (Tr. 36, 51, 80.)

Applicant\u2019s \nspouse acquired U.S. permanent-residency status on October 27, 2017. (GE 2; AE A.) \nRequired to leave the United States to renew her U.S. permanent residency, Applicant\u2019s \nspouse joined Applicant on a business trip to Taiwan. She stayed with her family during \ntheir two weeks in Taiwan, and he went to the southern part of the country for his work. \n(Tr. 52.) Her U.S. permanent residency status was renewed and is now set to expire on \nFebruary 18, 2031. (AE A.) She intends to become a U.S. citizen. She applied for U.S. \nnaturalization in June 2020, and has her citizenship interview scheduled for April 20, \n2021. (AE B; Tr. 54-55.) Applicant states that his spouse will relinquish her Taiwanese \npassport when she becomes a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 55.) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse worked as an accountant in the United States before taking her \npresent position as a full-time financial controller. (Tr. 52.) She and Applicant are in the \nprocess of jointly purchasing a condominium in the United States. They do not intend to \nmove to Taiwan when Applicant retires. (Tr. 70.) Applicant owns their current home, which \nhad been his residence during much of his first marriage. He retained the house in his \ndivorce from his first wife. (GE 1.) Neither Applicant nor his spouse owns any financial or \nproperty interests in Taiwan. (Tr. 68-69.) Applicant testified that if his spouse were to \ninherit any asset in Taiwan, she would give it to her brother. (Tr. 84.) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has close relationships with her mother, her brother, and her \nbrother\u2019s wife, who are resident citizens of Taiwan. Her father is deceased. Her mother \nworks part time as a seamstress in Taiwan. She speaks no English. Applicant\u2019s spouse \n\u201cmisses\u201d her mother, with whom she speaks via \u201ca FaceTime type of thing\u201d three or four \ntimes a week. (Tr. 55-56.) After immigrating to the United States, Applicant\u2019s spouse sent \nher mother financial support at $500 monthly until early 2020, when her brother and his \nwife moved in with their mother, who owns her home in Taiwan. (Tr. 83.) Applicant\u2019s \nspouse has sent her mother $500 every three months or so since early 2020. (Tr. 81-82.) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse also gives her mother small items that can fit in Applicant\u2019s suitcase \nwhen he travels to Taiwan on business. Applicant understands that it is culturally \nimportant to his spouse to provide for her mother, and he does not have an issue with the \namount of financial support or the gifts his spouse sends her mother. (Tr. 56-57, 83.) To \nApplicant\u2019s knowledge, his mother-in-law has no connection to Taiwan\u2019s or China\u2019s \ngovernment. (Tr. 57.) He does not think that his mother-in-law knows what he does for a \nliving. (Tr. 61.) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s brother works for a cement company in Taiwan. He served \ntwo years of compulsory military service in Taiwan\u2019s Navy, but has no other military \nservice. Applicant does not know the dates of his brother-in-law\u2019s service in Taiwan\u2019s \nNavy. (Tr. 58-59.) Applicant does not believe his brother-in-law has any current ties to \nTaiwan\u2019s government. His brother-in-law speaks a little English and his brother-in-law\u2019s \nwife speaks even less English. (Tr. 45, 74.)

As for his brother-in-law\u2019s wife, Applicant believes her work in Taiwan involves \npaperwork for vehicle imports. (Tr. 62-63.) Applicant\u2019s spouse has a close relationship \nwith her brother, but she is not particularly close to his wife. She contacts her brother \n\u201cmaybe a couple times a week or less.\u201d (Tr. 63.) She speaks with her sister-in-law when \nshe is on a call with her brother. Applicant does not believe his spouse contacts her sister-\nin-law directly. (Tr. 63.) Applicant first met his brother-in-law and sister-in-law in August \n2015. (GE 1.) On almost every business trip that he has to Taiwan since his marriage in \nMay 2017, Applicant has met with his brother-in-law and sister-in-law for lunch or dinner \non his arrival in Taiwan to exchange personal items (\u201cshoes, clothes, and stuff\u201d) between \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and her family. (Tr. 44-45, 73-74.) During his latest stay in Taiwan for \nwork from September 2020 through December 2020, Applicant met with his brother-in-\nlaw and sister-in-law twice. The second time was so tha\n \nt they could give Applicant some \nitems that they had purchased for Applicant\u2019s spouse at her request. (Tr. 45.) Applicant \ndoes not stay with his spouse\u2019s family when he is in Taiwan. (Tr. 60.) Applicant listed his \nbrother-in-law as a foreign contact on his August 2017 SCA because of their in-person \ncontact when Applicant is in Taiwan. (GE 1.) Applicant has limited contact with his brother-\nin-law otherwise. As for his contacts with his sister-in-law, Applicant stated on his SCA, \n\u201cThere is no regular frequency of contact for me or my wife. We would only see her with \nfamily during trips back to Taiwan.\u201d (GE 1.) \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is aware of Applicant\u2019s defense-contractor employment. \nApplicant does not believe his mother-in-law or sister-in-law know the identity of his \nemployer. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law are aware that he \ntravels to Taiwan to support a defense program, but Applicant does not discuss the \ntechnical aspects of his work with them. Applicant is \u201cnot sure\u201d whether they know that he \nholds a security clearance. He has not told them. (Tr. 61.) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s mother, brother, and sister-in-law came to the United States \nfor the first time in July 2019. They spent two weeks and stayed with Applicant and his \nspouse, who took them to restaurants, tourist sites, and a ball park. (Tr. 59.) Applicant \nconsiders his in-laws to be family. They have been \u201cvery kind\u201d to him. Applicant states \nthat his in-laws support the U.S.-Taiwan relationship and are not sympathetic to China. \n(Tr. 44-45.) \nOn his August 2017 SCA, Applicant included as foreign contacts three friends of \nhis spouse who are resident citizens of Taiwan: a close female friend whom his spouse \ncontacted weekly by text message and an occasional call; that friend\u2019s husband, with \nwhom Applicant had occasional contact between August 2015 and April 2017 while on \ntrips to Taiwan; and another female friend with whom his spouse had ongoing contact by \ntext messages and calls. Applicant first met this friend of his spouse in May 2016. That \nfriend visited Applicant and his spouse in the United States for two weeks in July 2017. \n(GE 1; Tr. 65-67.) It was this friend\u2019s first time in the United States. (Tr. 67.) During the \nthree months that he and his spouse lived together in Taiwan in early 2017, they \nsocialized with these friends a few times. Applicant does not have any contact with his \nspouse\u2019s friends on his own. He is aware that his spouse still has contact with her friends, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbut he does not think it is very frequent. (Tr. 64.) His spouse\u2019s close female friend in \nTaiwan is unemployed. Her spouse works in sales for a U.S.-based personal-care \nproducts company in Taiwan. (Tr. 65.) The other female friend works in business \ndevelopment for a European car company in Taiwan. (Tr. 66.) To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, \nnone of these Taiwanese nationals knows about his employment or that he has a security \nclearance. (Tr. 67.) Applicant regards these three friends of his spouse as casual \nacquaintances of his. (Tr. 45.) \nOn his August 2017 SCA, Applicant also reported that he had a business \nrelationship with a member of Taiwan\u2019s Air Force because of his work for the U.S. \ngovernment in Taiwan. (GE 1.) At his hearing, he testified that he had contact with two \nTaiwanese Air Force officers for his work in Taiwan, but one of them has since moved on \nfrom the contract. His relations with these Taiwanese resident citizens were purely \nprofessional. (Tr. 44, 67-68.) \nCharacter Reference \nA friend of Applicant\u2019s since 1974 considers Applicant \u201ca true American patriot.\u201d \nThis friend retired from the U.S. military at the rank of lieutenant colonel and held high-\nlevel security clearances during his military career. He considers Applicant to be honest \nand trustworthy, and recommends him for the highest level of clearance eligibility. He has \nnot known Applicant to talk about his work with the defense contractor. This friend \nattended the dinner in Taiwan to celebrate Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s upcoming \nwedding in 2017. He met Applicant\u2019s in-laws at the dinner, but he did not have much \ncommunication with them because of the language barrier. He is aware that Applicant\u2019s \nbrother-in-law had served in Taiwan\u2019s Navy. (Tr. 34-39.) \nAdministrative Notice \nAfter reviewing U.S. government publications concerning Taiwan and China and \ntheir foreign relations and mindful of my obligation to consider updated information, I take \nadministrative notice of the facts requested by the Government as supplemented by the \nfollowing facts: \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy established as a separate, independent \ngovernment by refugees from mainland China in 1949. The United States recognized \nTaiwan as an independent government until January 1979, when a Joint Communique \nswitched formal diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. In the Joint Communique, \nthe United States acknowledged China\u2019s position that there is but one China and Taiwan \nis part of China, while asserting that the United States would maintain cultural, \ncommercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. While the United \nStates does not support Taiwan\u2019s independence, the United States remains committed \nto assisting Taiwan in maintaining its defensive capabilities, and the two countries share \na robust unofficial relationship. Taiwan has historically been an active collector of U.S. \neconomic intelligence and technology, but recent cases involving the illegal export or \nattempted export of U.S. restricted, dual-use or military technology by Taiwanese \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnationals have been for the benefit of China or Chinese entities. In November 2018, a \nChinese government-owned integrated-circuits company established in July 2016 for the \nsole purpose of designing, developing, and manufacturing a dynamic random-access \nmemory device; a semiconductor foundry headquartered in Taiwan with offices \nworldwide; and three Taiwanese nationals; were indicted for conspiring to steal for China \nand the Taiwanese foundry the trade secrets of a U.S.-based leader in the global \nsemiconductor industry. \nSince the election of President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party \nin 2016, China has taken significant coercive measures against Taiwan, despite Taiwan \nwanting to maintain the status quo. China has suspended cross-strait communications \nand meetings; pressured countries with whom Taiwan has unofficial relations to terminate \ntheir relations with Taiwan; collaborated with individuals and organizations in Taiwan that \nsupport cross-Strait unification; spread disinformation through social media and other \nonline tools; and expanded and intensified Chinese military training activities near \nTaiwan. China\u2019s ongoing military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan led \nthe United States to urge Beijing in January 2021 to cease its efforts at intimidation \nagainst Taiwan and other countries in the Indo-Pacific region. To counter China\u2019s efforts, \nTaiwan is looking to strengthen its partnership with the United States. Because China is \nTaiwan\u2019s largest trading partner, China continues to have an outsized influence on \nTaiwan\u2019s economy. \nChina\u2019s overall strategy toward Taiwan continues to incorporate elements of both \npersuasion and coercion to hinder the development of political attitudes in Taiwan that \nfavor independence. China has not renounced the use of military force against Taiwan, \nand its aggressive intelligence activities against Taiwan include employing intelligence \noperatives based in Taiwan. Among U.S. allies and partners, Taiwan is a prominent target \nof Chinese espionage. Its economic espionage poses a threat to Taiwan\u2019s security and \nto the security of U.S. military information and equipment to which Taiwan has access. \nChina is an authoritarian state with paramount authority vested in the Chinese \nCommunist Party (CCP). In all important government, economic, and cultural institutions \nin China, the CCP ensures that party and state policy guidance is followed. President Xi \nhas very few checks on his power as Beijing continues to restrict the personal freedoms \nof its citizens. China presents a persistent espionage and cyber-attack threat to the United \nStates as China seeks to support its strategic development goals in science and \ntechnology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy. To support its \nmilitary modernization, China fills the gaps in its defense and commercial research by \nengaging in large-scale, state-sponsored theft of intellectual property and proprietary \ninformation. In accord with its national security objective to leverage legally and illegally \nacquired dual-use and military-related technologies to its advantage, China uses its \nintelligence services, computer intrusions, and other illicit approaches to obtain national \nsecurity and export-controlled technologies, controlled equipment, and other materials. \nChina leverages foreign investments, commercial joint ventures, academic exchanges, \nthe experience of Chinese students and researchers, and state-sponsored industrial and \ntechnical espionage to increase the level of technologies and expertise available to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nsupport its military research, development, and acquisition. China blends intelligence and \nnon-intelligence assets and frequently seeks to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with \nfamily ties to China who can use their insider access to steal trade secrets from U.S. \ncompanies. Reports of Chinese espionage have increased significantly in recent years. \nIn June 2019, a Chinese electrical engineer with part-time residency in the United \nStates was found guilty of multiple federal charges, including engaging in a scheme to \nillegally obtain integrated semiconductor chips with military applications that were \nexported to China without the required export license. China also targets U.S. security-\nclearance holders. In May 2019, a former U.S. intelligence officer, who held a Top Secret \nclearance until he left government service in October 2012, was sentenced to 20 years in \nprison for conspiring with a Chinese intelligence officer to transmit national defense \ninformation to China. In July 2019, a former employee of the U.S. State Department with \na Top Secret clearance received a 40-month prison sentence for conspiring with two \nChinese intelligence agents to defraud the United States. She failed to report her \nrepeated contacts with the foreign intelligence agents who provided her with tens of \nthousands of dollars in gifts and benefits over five years in return for her providing internal \nState Department documents on topics ranging from economics to visits by dignitaries \nbetween the two countries. In December 2020, the U.S. State Department issued a level \n3 travel advisory for China due to China\u2019s arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including \ncarrying out unlawful detentions and using bans on U.S. citizens and those of other \ncountries without due process of law. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s mother, brother and his wife, and three close friends are \nresident citizens of Taiwan. Applicant has had contact with two officers of Taiwan\u2019s Air \nForce over the years because of his work for his employer. Review of Applicant\u2019s contacts \nand connections to these foreign citizens is warranted to determine whether they present \na heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a) or AG \u00b6 7(e) or create a potential conflict of interest \nunder AG \u00b6 7(b). Those disqualifying conditions provide: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember or a spouse\u2019s family member living under a foreign government. The nature and \nstrength of the family ties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the \nnature of its government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government; a family member is associated \nwith, or dependent on, the foreign government; or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence operations against the United States. In considering the nature of the foreign \ngovernment, the administrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nTaiwan and the United States have a positive and robust unofficial relationship. \nYet, Guideline B concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The \nAppeal Board has long held that \u201c[t]he United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 02-11570 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Taiwan has historically engaged in \neconomic espionage to acquire U.S. military and dual-use technologies that could \nstrengthen its defensive posture against China. China has an overall strategy toward \nTaiwan that incorporates elements of both persuasion and coercion to hinder the \ndevelopment of political attitudes in Taiwan that favor independence. China\u2019s increasingly \naggressive intelligence activities against Taiwan include employing intelligence \noperatives based in Taiwan. Among U.S. allies and partners, Taiwan is a prominent target \nof Chinese espionage. Its economic espionage poses a threat to Taiwan\u2019s security and \nto the security of U.S. military information and equipment to which Taiwan has access, \nsuch as the program which regularly takes Applicant to Taiwan. Given those geopolitical \nrealities, Applicant has a high burden of persuasion to demonstrate that his and his \nspouse\u2019s relationships with her family and friends in Taiwan and his contacts with \nmembers of Taiwan\u2019s military do not pose an unacceptable security risk. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has close ties of affection to her mother and her brother in \nTaiwan, and to a lesser extent to her sister-in-law. She contacts them multiple times \nweekly and provides financial support for her mother on a regular basis. Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts with his spouse\u2019s family members are limited to when he is in Taiwan for his \nemployer. Yet, on almost every one of his business trips to Taiwan since May 2017, \nApplicant has met his brother-in-law and his brother-in-law\u2019s wife for lunch or dinner, \nprimarily to exchange items between his spouse and her family. He has had in-person \ncontact with his mother-in-law on occasion when in Taiwan. Communication with his \nspouse\u2019s family members is limited because of the language barrier. Even so, there is a \nrebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the \nimmediate family members of his or her spouse. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-12659 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2013). Furthermore, Applicant testified that his spouse\u2019s family members \nhave been very kind to him, and he considers them family. Applicant and his spouse \nhosted her family for two weeks in their home in the United States in July 2019. The close \nfamily bonds are sufficient to create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d Additionally, these relationships create a potential \nconflict of interest for Applicant between his obligation to protect sensitive information and \nhis desire to help his wife or her family members. AGs \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. Regarding \nAG \u00b6 7(e), Applicant\u2019s spouse is close to her family living in Taiwan, and Applicant is close \nto his spouse. There is a theoretical risk of pressure or coercion that could be exercised \nagainst Applicant through his spouse. AG \u00b6 7(e) is also established. \nAs for Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s friends in Taiwan, Applicant has no independent \nongoing contact with them. However, his spouse contacts her close friends on a regular \nbasis. Moreover, Applicant and his spouse hosted one of these friends for two weeks at \ntheir home in the United States in 2017. Applicant also has had contact with at least two \nofficers in Taiwan\u2019s military. To the extent that a heightened risk exists under AG \u00b6 7(a) \nbecause of his spouse\u2019s close friendships with these Taiwan resident citizens and his \nongoing contacts with an officer in Taiwan\u2019s Air Force (the other officer is no longer on \nthe contract), there is no indication that these connections present a conflict of interest \nunder AG \u00b6 7(b). It is difficult to see where Applicant could be exploited, induced, \nmanipulated, pressured or coerced because of these friends. He makes no effort to \ncontact them when he is in Taiwan without his spouse. As for Applicant\u2019s military contacts, \nApplicant testified credibly that his contacts are solely professional in the context of his \ndefense-contract work for the U.S. government. \nApplication of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) \ntriggers review of possibly mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8. The following could have \nsome application based on the facts in this case: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; and \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 8(a), there is nothing about the positions or activities of Applicant\u2019s \nspouse\u2019s Taiwanese family members or friends that makes it likely Applicant will be \nplaced in the untenable position of having to choose between their interests and the \ninterests of the United States. There is no evidence that the Taiwanese family members \nand friends have any recent connection with, obligations to, or receive benefits from \nTaiwan\u2019s government. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law works as a seamstress. His brother-in-\nlaw and sister-in-law are respectively employed by cement and motor car companies in \nthe commercial sector. His spouse\u2019s close friend does not work outside the home, and \nthis friend\u2019s spouse is employed by a U.S.-based personal-care products company. The \nother friend works in business development for a European car company in Taiwan. \nAs for the country involved, the special relationship that has existed between the \nUnited States and Taiwan over the past half-century has been one marked by mutually \nreconcilable political and economic interests. The United States is committed to assisting \nTaiwan in maintaining its defensive capabilities, and Applicant is directly involved in that \neffort by traveling frequently to Taiwan to support a program on contract for the U.S. \ngovernment. Taiwan\u2019s democratic institutions are compatible with our own traditions and \nrespect for human rights and the rule of law. While Taiwan has historically targeted the \nUnited States and its companies for economic and proprietary information, there is no \nknown recent history of hostage taking or of undue pressure being placed on its citizens \nto obtain classified or sensitive data. However, given the increasingly aggressive posture \nof China towards Taiwan, which includes using intelligence assets in Taiwan to foment \nanti-democratic and pro-China sentiment in Taiwan and obtain sensitive U.S. economic \nand military information to which Taiwan has access, it is difficult to apply AG \u00b6 8(a) in \nmitigation, especially considering the closeness of the family bond in this case. \nApplicant has a credible case for substantial mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). His \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States are so deep and longstanding that he can \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbe counted on to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. A lifelong \nresident citizen of the United States, Applicant was raised to place U.S. interests over \nthose of any other country or person. A longtime friend of Applicant\u2019s, a retired lieutenant \ncolonel who held high-level clearances for his military duties in the past, described \nApplicant as \u201ca true American patriot.\u201d Applicant was educated in the United States and \nhas pursued his career here. Of considerable weight in mitigation, Applicant has worked \nfor his defense-contractor employer since October 1984 and has held a security \nclearance throughout his employment with apparently no security violations. His two sons \nare U.S. native-born citizens currently serving in the National Guard and military Reserve \nforces. All of Applicant\u2019s travel to Taiwan has been to support a program of benefit to \nTaiwan and at the behest of the U.S. government in support of a stable democracy in \nTaiwan. Applicant\u2019s spouse immigrated to the United States within the last five years, but \nshe is a U.S. permanent resident and has an upcoming citizenship interview in April 2021. \nHer application for U.S. citizenship shows that she intends to remain in the United States. \nShe has worked as an accountant in the United States and is currently employed as a \nfinancial controller. She and Applicant are in the process of jointly purchasing a \ncondominium in the United States. Neither she nor Applicant owns any property or have \nany financial assets in Taiwan that could be used as leverage against Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is partially established. Applicant has no ongoing communication on his \nown with his spouse\u2019s friends in Taiwan. However, it cannot reasonably apply in mitigation \nof his ties to his spouse\u2019s family members. While his contacts with them are limited \nbecause of the language barrier, he considers them family, and his spouse \nunderstandably has strong feelings of affection for her family members and a sense of \nobligation toward her mother, as evidenced by her regular financial support. \nAG \u00b6 8(d) applies in mitigation of his contacts to the officers in Taiwan\u2019s military, \nwhich may be considered sanctioned by the United States in that they have been on \nofficial business in the performance of U.S. government contract. AG \u00b6 8(e) warrants \nsome consideration as well, given that Applicant notified his employer of his relationship \nwith his spouse on his return from his stay in Taiwan in 2015 and then reported the \nchanges in their status from dating to engagement to marriage. Applicant listed his \nspouse, her relatives, and her friends on his SF 86 completed in August 2017. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Those factors are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nIn foreign influence cases, it must be acknowledged that people act in \nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a family member. \nAs stated by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 08-10025 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, \n2009), \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but \nmerely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with \nchoices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a family member.\u201d Moreover, in \nevaluating Guideline B concerns, the Appeal Board has held that: \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \nand circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \nApplicant cannot control the actions of the Chinese or Taiwanese government, \nintelligence, or security services, but he can control his response if placed in the untenable \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests \nof his spouse\u2019s family members in Taiwan. He shows that he understands his obligations \nas a longtime clearance holder by not discussing the technical aspects of his work with \nanyone without a need-to-know, including his spouse, who could relay them in Chinese \nto her family members without his knowledge. His unrebutted testimony is that he has \ncomplied with his reporting obligations with regard to his relationship with a foreign \nnational as it progressed from dating to engagement to marriage. There is no indication \nwhatsoever that he has betrayed the confidence placed in him. While Applicant\u2019s ties to \nTaiwan through his spouse and because of his work raise security concerns, they have \nto be weighed against his unblemished record with regard to security compliance. There \nis nothing untoward about his spouse\u2019s relationship with her family members or friends in \nTaiwan. I find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue security \nclearance eligibility for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 63 years old. She married in 1974 and divorced in 1988. She has three adult children from the marriage. She remarried in 2000, and she has four adult stepchildren. She and her husband adopted two of his grandchildren. She completed a doctorate degree in 2021. She also has two master\u2019s degrees (1998, 2015), a bachelor\u2019s degree (1995), and an associate\u2019s degree (1993). She has been employed with the same federal contractor since 2002, except for a short period when she was employed by one of its subsidiaries. She has held her current security clearance since approximately 2012. (Item 3) Applicant has a history of financial difficulties that were caused by many events that were beyond her control. She filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1994 that was converted to Chapter 7 in January 1998 and discharged in April 1998. This occurred after Applicant\u2019s divorce from her first husband. She was left with many marital bills that were to be paid by her ex-husband and were not. Applicant attempted to pay them through the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but was unable to do so because of her limited income and supporting her three children.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s answered the SOR on February 12, 2021, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

Applicant objected to the security concern included under \nGuideline F, financial considerations that may be applicable in her case. The SOR is not \nevidence, and her objection is overruled. There were no other objections, and Items 2 \nthrough 7 and AE A through O are admitted in evidence. The case was assigned to me \non October 20, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h. She admitted the SOR \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, through 1.k. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 63 years old. She married in 1974 and divorced in 1988. She has three \nadult children from the marriage. She remarried in 2000, and she has four adult \nstepchildren. She and her husband adopted two of his grandchildren. She completed a \ndoctorate degree in 2021. She also has two master\u2019s degrees (1998, 2015), a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree (1995), and an associate\u2019s degree (1993). She has been employed with the same \nfederal contractor since 2002, except for a short period when she was employed by one \nof its subsidiaries. She has held her current security clearance since approximately 2012. \n(Item 3) \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties that were caused by many events \nthat were beyond her control. She filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1994 that was converted \nto Chapter 7 in January 1998 and discharged in April 1998. This occurred after Applicant\u2019s \ndivorce from her first husband. She was left with many marital bills that were to be paid \nby her ex-husband and were not. Applicant attempted to pay them through the Chapter \n13 bankruptcy, but was unable to do so because of her limited income and supporting her \nthree children. She earned about $15,000 per year at the time. (SOR \u00b6 1.j; Items 2, 7) \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2000, and her debts were \ndischarged in December 2000. She attributed this bankruptcy to losing her job in 1999 \nand moving back to her home state. (SOR \u00b6 1.k; Items 2, 7) \nIn 2005, Applicant\u2019s husband was not working, and her son, his wife, and their \nthree children moved in with them when her son lost his job. Applicant did not earn enough \nmoney to support the household. Applicant and her husband filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nin October 2005. They completed all of the court approved payments to their creditors \nthrough the bankruptcy trustee, and their debts were discharged in 2010. (SOR \u00b6 1.l; \nItems 2, 7, 8) \nIn December 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as \npart of her background investigation. She attributed her past financial problems to \nsupporting her son and his family when he lost his job and moved in with her; her \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhusband\u2019s loss of his job; funeral expenses as a result of the passing of her father in \n2016; and medical issues in 2010, 2017 and twice in 2019 from her kidney failure. In \naddition, her husband suffered a massive heart attack in October 2020. He survived, but \nhis heart only functions at half capacity. Her family incurs about $13,000 annually in out-\nof-pocket medical expenses. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s student loans were past due. Applicant explained \nthat she was unaware that they were not placed in a deferred status when she resumed \nschool. She provided documents to show that her student loans are deferred. The \ndeferment will expire in April 2022, and she will have to begin paying these loans. The \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. (Item 2; AE A, B) \nApplicant disputed the charged-off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($21,950) because of the \nalleged fraudulent practices of the car dealership. A lawsuit was filed by the creditor and \nresponded to by Applicant. This debt was settled and paid by Applicant in July 2021. This \ndebt is resolved. (Item 2, AE C). \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c was for a repossessed vehicle that Applicant purchased for \nher stepdaughter who was to make the payments, but did not. In Applicant\u2019s response to \nthe FORM, she stated she has repeatedly contacted the creditor and left messages that \nshe wants to settle this debt, but has not received a collection letter or return call. Her \nAugust 2018 credit report lists the debt as a repossession and the \u201cmerchandise taken \nback by grantor/possible balance due.\u201d There is no balance due noted on this entry. Her \nMay 2019 and June 2021 credit reports also note the debt as a repossession, but the \npast-due amount and balance owed is zero. Applicant has attempted to responsibly \naddress this debt. It does not appear there is a deficiency balance. It is resolved. (Items \n2, 4, 5, 6; AE A) \nApplicant provided documents to show that she has a payment plan with the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d and has been making consistent monthly payments since 2016. \nThe current balance owed as of May 2021 is $551. Based on the payments scheduled, \nthis debt should be completely paid by November 2021. It is resolved. (Item 2, AE D) \nApplicant denied she owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($122), stating she has \nrepeatedly disputed this debt and never had an account with the creditor.

Applicant has taken \nreasonable action to resolve these debts. (Items 2, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE A, AE E through AE M) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had debts discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 1998 and \nDecember 2000. She filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2005 and completed it in 2010. \nApplicant began experiencing financial difficulties again in approximately 2016 and \naccumulated delinquent debts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties in the past were caused by many things beyond her \ncontrol. She filed bankruptcy three times. In 2005 she filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy and \nadhered to a payment plan until it was discharged in 2010. This is an indicator that \nApplicant is not ignoring her debts and responsibly addressed them. The facts suggest \nthat despite many setbacks, she is diligently taking care of her family and addressing her \nfinances. Her financial history is far from perfect. However, the standard is not perfection, \nbut whether her financial issues raise a security concern. Although she has had difficulties \ndue to trying to take care of her family, medical setbacks, and unemployment, she has \nmanaged to address her finances. I find she has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and her conduct does not cast doubt on her currently reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. She has made good-faith payments to her creditors \nand is adhering to plans to resolve her debts. She disputed the legitimacy of some debts \nand they were removed from her credit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d) and 20(e) apply. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that she has received financial counseling. With \nupcoming payments in the next six months due on her student loans and based on her \npast history of financial difficulties, it would be prudent for her to participate in financial \ncounseling so similar issues do not recur. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant had many events beyond her control that impacted her finances. Her \npast financial history is not perfect, but I believe that she took the required steps available \nto her to correct her past problems. The security concern is whether she has acted \nirresponsibly regarding her financial obligations. The evidence supports she has not. She \nhas met her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or \ndoubts as to her eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude she has mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

Applicant also received \na written warning from her employer for misuse of her corporate credit card. Applicant \nadmits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline except 1.d., 1.h., \n1.i., 1.j., and 1.q. Credit reports of the Applicant dated February 3, 2018; June 14, \n2019; and September 21, 2020, confirm the outstanding debts. (Government Exhibits \n6, 7 and 8.) Applicant began working for her current employer in 1997. She has held a \nsecurity clearance for the past twenty-three years. She has never committed a security \nviolation or infraction. She states that she has completed all required security training \nand complied with all procedures for safeguarding classified material. \nApplicant was married to her first husband from 1998 until 2011, when they \ndivorced. During the marriage, he was a stay-at-home Dad, taking care of the children, \nand she was the breadwinner, working outside of the home, providing the main financial \nsupport for the family. Applicant states that in December 2008 she and her husband \nseparated, and she became a single parent, having sole responsibility for their two \nchildren. Following the divorce, in 2011, Applicant was unable to pay the debt because \nof her other financial obligations. Applicant stated that initially her divorce settlement \nrequired her to pay her husband spousal support in the amount of $1,500 dollars a \nmonth from April 2011 to March 2016. He was supposed to pay her $1,250 a month in \nchild support until the children reached the age of 18 or 19. The final version of the \ndivorce settlement changed and Applicant was required to pay her husband $250 a \nmonth for five years, and he was not required to pay her child support. In total, \nApplicant paid her husband a total of $15,000 in spousal support. Applicant also paid \ncredit card charges made by her husband during their period of separation because he \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nwas an authorized user on her account.  All of the expenses she incurred from the \nseparation and divorce totaled about $100,000, including attorney\u2019s fees, mediation \ncosts, child care expenses, home maintenance issues, and other related matters.  \nAlthough the divorce decree made her ex-husband responsible for half of their credit \ncard debt, she was concerned that he may not pay his half, (which he did not do), and \nso she tried to continue making payments on all of the debts until it became impossible.  \nThis exhausted all of the Applicant\u2019s financial resources.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the \nFORM.)      \nConcerned about her financial situation and her excessive delinquent debt, \nApplicant sought out legal advice from an attorney regarding payment of her debt. \nApplicant was advised not to contact her creditors regarding her debt since it was about \nto drop off of her credit reports, because there has been no account activity for seven \nyears, the debts were no longer enforceable, and they would cease to affect her credit \nscore. She relied on this advice, until she received the SOR, and then contacted a \nsecurity clearance consultant for help. Upon receipt of the SOR, on November 22, \n2019, Applicant took out a loan for $30,000 that she is repaying in the amount of $934 \nmonthly for three years. She is using the money from the loan to pay off her delinquent \ncreditors. (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \n1.a. For a two-year period from 2015 through 2017, Applicant used her company \ncredit card for personal use. She explained that because of her poor credit rating she \nwas unable to get her own personal credit card. She states that she always made \ntimely payments as required on the company credit card and she only sought \nreimbursement for company and work-related expenses that she charged on the card.  \nThis activity was discovered during an audit of her company credit card account. As a \nresult, Applicant received a written reprimand from her supervisor. She states that she \naccepts full responsibility for this rule violation. She states that she was motivated by \nthe convenience of using a credit card rather than writing checks or paying with cash for \npersonal expenses. \nShe realizes that using her company credit card was a bad \ndecision, and she states that she will never repeat it. Despite the written reprimand she \nreceived from her supervisor for misuse of her company credit card in November 2017, \nApplicant was rated as an \u201cExcellent Performer\u201d that year by her supervisor. \n(Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \nDue to the separation and divorce, the following delinquent debts became owing: \n1.b. A delinquent debt owed to a department store was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $9,843. Applicant opened the account in 2006. After receiving \nthe SOR, Applicant contacted the creditor and they agreed to accept $3,937 to settle \nthe account in full. On December 9, 2019, Applicant made a payment of $3,937 as \nagreed. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) The debt is now \nresolved. \n1.c. A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$949. \nApplicant settled the debt in the amount of $569 on November 12, 2019. \n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)

After receiving the SOR, \nApplicant contacted the creditor and agreed to settle the account for $8,200 prior to \nMarch 30, 2020.  A letter dated May 19, 2020, from the creditor acknowledged receipt of \nthe payment and settlement of the account as of April 20, 2020. The debt is now \nresolved.

This account was opened in 2006. After receiving the SOR, \nApplicant contacted the creditor and agreed to settle the account by paying $7,103 in 12 \nmonthly payments of $592 each month beginning on December 31, 2019. Applicant \nstates that she made these installment payments sooner than required. The debt is \nnow resolved.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, Response to FORM, and Exhibit C.) \n1.g.

A delinquent debt was charged off in the approximate amount of $2,352. \nApplicant denies the debt, claiming that she resolved it December 31, 2015. Applicant \nclaims that she paid part of it but has no records to substantiate this assertion.

A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$238. Applicant denies the debt because she has no recollection of it. She has made \ncontact with the creditor a number of times, but has been unsuccessful in obtaining \ninformation regarding the account. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, Response to FORM, \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibits O and P.) \nApplicant has worked for her current employer for the past twenty-three years. \nShe is an outstanding employee and has received a number of promotions. Her most \nrecent promotion was in April 2019. Her current annual salary is $179,000. She is \nresponsible for managing 197 employees and a budget of $100,000,000.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nDue to a separation and divorce, Applicant incurred delinquent debts that she \ncould not afford to pay. She also misused her company credit card. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each one of them set forth below: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAs a result of Applicant\u2019s separation and divorce, she became excessively \nindebted to a number of creditors and could not afford to pay her delinquent debts. To \ncomplicate matters, her ex-husband refused to pay his part of the financial obligation \nand she was left with all of the debt from the marriage. Applicant followed the wrong \nadvice from her attorney by not attempting to pay her debts even after she could afford \nto do so. When she found out that she should resolve her delinquent debt, no matter \nwhat, and how it can adversely affect her security clearance if she does not, she worked \nhard to get them paid as quickly as possible. Applicant took out a $30,000 loan and \nstarted paying her delinquent debts. \nShe clearly understands her responsibility to \nresolve her debts in a timely fashion and to always live within her means. Since she \nreceived the SOR, and has become more knowledgeable about her particular situation, \nshe has shown significant progress toward resolving her debts. In fact, Applicant has \ncontacted each of her creditors and has either settled the debt, paid it off in full, or \notherwise resolved it. The evidence shows that with some of her debts, Applicant not \nonly made the monthly installment payments she agreed to, but completed her \nsettlement commitment earlier than agreed. Applicant\u2019s conduct shows good judgment \nand a good faith effort. She has clearly demonstrated that her financial problems have \nbeen resolved, or are being resolved, and are unlikely to recur. Each of the mitigating \nconditions set forth above apply. Accordingly, this guideline is found for the Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has exercised sound judgment and \nhas addressed her debts and made a good faith effort to resolve them. She is no longer \nexcessively indebted. Applicant also misused her company credit card, for which there \nis no excuse. This was obviously an aberration on her part that will not be repeated.  \nShe understands the severe consequences if it is to ever happen again. Under the \ncircumstances, considering her unblemished years of service with her employer, her \noutstanding letters of recommendation, her impeccable performance evaluations, as \nwell as her numerous job promotions over the years, she has demonstrated that she \ncan be trusted with the national secrets. Applicant is an individual with whom the \nGovernment can be confident to know she will always follow rules and regulations, and \ndo the right thing, even when no one is looking. Applicant meets the qualifications for a \nsecurity clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.q.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Company B). She has worked for her current employer since April 2017. She seeks to retain a security clearance, which she has held since about 2003. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006. She is married for the third time after two divorces. She has an adult child. (Transcript (Tr.) at 15-17,44; GE 1, 3) Applicant worked as a cybersecurity specialist for a defense contractor (Company A) from 2009 until she was terminated in March 2017 after allegations of poor performance, timecard fraud, and copying proprietary information onto a thumb drive. Applicant\u2019s section failed an inspection in November 2016. Her title and salary remained the same after the inspection, but she no longer supervised employees. She went to human resources (HR) in November 2016 with a complaint that she was blamed for the failure. On January 14, 2017, she again reported to HR what she viewed as unethical practices by the company\u2019s leadership. (Tr. at 17, 33-34; GE 1-3) In about November or December 2016, Applicant sought employment with Company B. On February 7, 2017, Company B sent her a welcome-to-the company email with information about her pre-employment actions to complete, including a drug test. Applicant\u2019s supervisors at Company A had difficulty locating her in January and February 2017. On February 8, 2017, Applicant was given a verbal warning regarding her absences and her inability to be contacted by fellow employees",

Applicant responded to the SOR on \nNovember 8, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case \nwas assigned to three other administrative judges before being reassigned to me on \nJuly 7, 2021. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on August 5, 2021. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, which was admitted in evidence without \nobjection. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Company B). She \nhas worked for her current employer since April 2017. She seeks to retain a security \nclearance, which she has held since about 2003. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2006. She is married for the third time after two divorces. She has an adult child. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 15-17,44; GE 1, 3) \nApplicant worked as a cybersecurity specialist for a defense contractor \n(Company A) from 2009 until she was terminated in March 2017 after allegations of \npoor performance, timecard fraud, and copying proprietary information onto a thumb \ndrive. Applicant\u2019s section failed an inspection in November 2016. Her title and salary \nremained the same after the inspection, but she no longer supervised employees. She \nwent to human resources (HR) in November 2016 with a complaint that she was blamed \nfor the failure. On January 14, 2017, she again reported to HR what she viewed as \nunethical practices by the company\u2019s leadership. (Tr. at 17, 33-34; GE 1-3) \nIn about November or December 2016, Applicant sought employment with \nCompany B. On February 7, 2017, Company B sent her a welcome-to-the company \nemail with information about her pre-employment actions to complete, including a drug \ntest. Applicant\u2019s supervisors at Company A had difficulty locating her in January and \nFebruary 2017. On February 8, 2017, Applicant was given a verbal warning regarding \nher absences and her inability to be contacted by fellow employees. On February 8, \n2017, Applicant downloaded about 3,000 files from her Company A computer and \nserver onto an unencrypted thumb drive. The files included 32 personal files, and the \nrest were Company A\u2019s files. (Tr. at 27, 33-36, 51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nOn February 9, 2017, Applicant\u2019s management chain requested the company to \nconduct an investigation into suspected timecard fraud. On February 14, 2017, \nApplicant was interviewed by the investigators about her hours and about the files on \nthe thumb drive. (Tr. at 27; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that she gave her employer two weeks\u2019 notice on February 14, \n2017, before the investigation was initiated. There is nothing in Company A\u2019s report of \nthe investigation to substantiate that assertion. Company A was aware from reviewing \nApplicant\u2019s computer that Company B had requested that she undergo a drug test. She \nwas asked if she had a job offer from Company B. She stated that she accepted the job \noffer, but a start date was yet to be determined until all contingencies were met. \nApplicant was placed on paid suspension until the investigation was complete. She was \nterminated by Company A on March 17, 2017. Applicant asserted that Company A\u2019s \nactions against her were because of her whistleblower report to HR. (Tr. at 22-23; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nApplicant stated that she was not terminated from Company A because she \nvoluntarily resigned to take the job with Company B before she was terminated. I note \nthat she reported on her Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nNovember 2017 that she was \u201cFired,\u201d and her attorney noted in her response to a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproposed debarment that Applicant was \u201cterminated\u201d in retaliation after she reported \nunethical conduct to HR and she gave notice of her intent to resign. Applicant was \nsuccessful in the debarment action. (Tr. at 22-23, 40-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1) For the purpose of this decision, it makes little difference whether Applicant was \nterminated or resigned before she could be terminated. The underlying conduct is the \nissue here. \nApplicant denied the allegation of timecard fraud. Company A investigators \nchecked Applicant\u2019s timecards against the records of when she swiped into her work \nfacility, and determined that over a six-month period, there was a discrepancy of 294 \nhours. Applicant asserted, and her supervisor confirmed, that her supervisor permitted \nApplicant to unofficially work from home. Additionally, the investigators checked \nApplicant\u2019s primary facility, but the company had another facility a few miles away. The \nrecords would not show all the time she spent at that facility and traveling back and forth \nbetween the facilities. Finally, Applicant\u2019s supervisor suspected that Applicant was not \nworking all of the hours that she reported on her timecards, but with the approval of the \nsupervisor above her, they chose not to question Applicant about her hours, and just \napproved Applicant\u2019s timecards. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3) \nDuring her interview by Company A investigators on February 14, 2017, \nApplicant admitted that she downloaded the files. She stated that she was backing up \nher personal files, and found it easier to copy her entire directory and go to a meeting \nwhile the files were being copied. She stated that she planned to delete the Company A \nfiles from the thumb drive, but had not had the opportunity to do so. (Tr. at 27; GE 2) \nThe investigation determined that it took 68 minutes to download the more than \n3,000 files onto the thumb drive. It would have taken less than two minutes to download \nApplicant\u2019s personal files. The investigation concluded that Applicant is an experienced \ncybersecurity professional who knew it was inappropriate to use an unapproved and \nunencrypted thumb drive to download Company A proprietary information. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that she \u201cinadvertently\u201d and \u201cpurely by accident\u201d transferred \nthe Company A proprietary files along with her personal files to the thumb drive, and \nthat it was never her intention to download or keep the files. She stated that it was a \nsimple swipe to download everything, and that she did not notice that it took more than \nan hour to download the files because she went to a meeting. Applicant\u2019s assertion that \nshe \u201cinadvertently\u201d downloaded the files is inconsistent with her statement to Company \nA investigators in February 2017 that she found it easier to copy her entire directory. \nShe indicated that she knew that plugging in the thumb drive would prompt a report to \nthe security office; she self-reported the incident to the security office; and she returned \nthe thumb drive the same day that the files were downloaded. That assertion is \ninconsistent with the report of the investigation that showed the files were downloaded \non February 8, 2017, and Applicant provided the thumb drive on February 14, 2017, \nwhen she was interviewed. She later testified that she went to security on February 8, \n2017, who told her that copying her own personal files was not against their rules and \nprocedures.

She reported the timecard issues with Company A, but she did not \nreport that she downloaded Company A\u2019s proprietary files without the company\u2019s \nauthorization. Even if the downloading was inadvertent, she should have reported the \ninformation under the Use of Information Technology Systems question that asked: \u201cIn \nthe last seven (7) years have you introduced, removed, or used hardware, software, or \nmedia in connection with any information technology system without authorization, \nwhen specifically prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or \nattempted any of the above?\u201d1  (GE 1) \nDuring her March 2019 interview for her background investigation, Applicant \ndiscussed the timecard allegations. She also indicated that she downloaded personal \nfiles onto a thumb drive. There is no indication in the report of the interview that she also \ndownloaded Company A\u2019s files. In her response to the SOR allegation that she \ndownloaded about 3,000 Company A files onto a thumb drive, she wrote: \nI partially admit. While working at [Company A] for approximately 8 years \nI worked on numerous computer systems; one work station which could \nbe considered my personal work computer which housed unclassified \ninformation and numerous other work stations which did contain classified \ninformation. After I accepted my new job at [Company B] I transferred \nwhat I had accumulated on my \u201cpersonal work computer\u201d to a thumbdrive. \nThings included were tax returns, leases, receipts and various other \npersonal items; I admit I should not have had these items on my \ncomputer. Nonetheless when leaving [Company A] I transferred all my \nfiles. I would note that nothing on my computer was classified at all. I knew \nthis when I took this action. \nI was contacted shortly after that [Company A\u2019s system] put out a \nnotification of this transfer. Once notified I immediately returned the \nthumbdrive with all files. I did not download any file to any computer \nincluding all of my personal documents. \nI did not find Applicant credible. After considering all of the evidence, I find that \nshe intentionally downloaded Company A proprietary information, and she has been \nless than forthcoming about her conduct up to and during her hearing. \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to her character and \nexcellent job performance, both at Company A and Company B. She is praised for her \nwork ethic, patience, mentoring skills, positive attitude, technical proficiency, leadership, \nstability, discretion, dependability, professionalism, trustworthiness, and reliability. \n(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A) \n1  Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern for handling protected information is set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information-raises doubt \nabout an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security \nconcern. \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \nand \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information. \nApplicant used an unapproved and unencrypted thumb drive to download \nCompany A proprietary information. The above disqualifying conditions are established. \nConditions that could mitigate handling protected information security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 35. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities;  \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or\nunclear instructions; and \n \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nThere is only one Guideline K allegation and that occurred almost five years ago. \nHad Applicant accepted full responsibility for her conduct, she might have mitigated the \nconduct. However, as discussed above, she has been less than forthcoming about her \nconduct up to and during her hearing. I am unable to find that the conduct is unlikely to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecur. It continues to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. The above mitigating conditions are not applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client  \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s downloading of Company A proprietary information is cross-alleged \nunder Guideline E. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly \napplicable because that conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the \nhandling protected information and use of information technology guidelines. However, \nthe general concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nThe timecard fraud allegation is less clear. There is a discrepancy between \nApplicant\u2019s timecards and the records of when she swiped into her work facility. \nHowever, that does not account for when Applicant\u2019s supervisor permitted her to \nunofficially work from home and the time Applicant spent at and traveling to and from \nthe second facility. Finally, Applicant\u2019s supervisor suspected that Applicant was not \nworking all of the hours that she reported on her timecards, but with the approval of a \nhigher-level supervisor, they chose not to question Applicant about her hours, and just \napproved Applicant\u2019s timecards. I am not convinced that Applicant committed the \nextensive timecard fraud reported in the investigation. Any discrepancy between the \nhours Applicant actually worked and what she reported on her timecards is mitigated. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThe handling protected information analysis applies equally here. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence, but the favorable information is insufficient to overcome \nher problematic conduct and failure to accept responsibility for that conduct. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and handling protected information security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline K: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

He denied SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nThe admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He has worked for defense contractors since April \n2010. He worked for contractor-one (C1) from 2010 to May 2017; he worked for \ncontractor-two (C2) beginning in June 2017 and lasting until August 2017 (C2 took over \nthe contract C1 previously held); and in August 2017, he started working for contractor-\nthree (C3), for whom he continues to work. He reported in his 2017 security clearance \napplication (SF-86) that he held a security clearance beginning in 2010. He holds a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and is currently working on a master\u2019s \ndegree. He is single, never married, and has one adult child. (Tr. 31, 38-40, 77; AE1, 3) \n \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline J, that in October 2016, Applicant was \ncharged with four felony drug-related offenses and that he ultimately pleaded guilty to \none charge of facilitation to possess marijuana for sale, a class 6 felony. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) It \nalso alleged, under Guideline E, the same conduct alleged under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 \n2.b) and that he failed to timely report his October 2016 arrest and his May 2017 \nconviction to his employer, as required. (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \n \n \nApplicant admitted pleading guilty to the class 6 felony (the lowest degree felony \nunder state law (See A.R.S. \u00a7 13-702)) drug facilitation charge on May 12, 2017. A \njudgment of conviction was entered that day. The arrest that resulted in this conviction \noccurred on October 21, 2016. He was sentenced to six months\u2019 probation, fees and \nfines. He was represented by a criminal defense attorney on these charges and was \nadvised by counsel not to disclose his arrest to his employer until after a judgment was \nentered, which turned out to be May 12, 2017. He successfully completed his probation \nand on December 19, 2017, his conviction was set aside. (Tr. 28, 39-40; GE 4; AE J) \nThe underlying facts that led to Applicant\u2019s plea and conviction are that on the \nmorning of October 21, 2016, while Applicant was asleep in his home, law enforcement \npersonnel raided his home possessing a search warrant. A search of an inoperable \nvehicle in his garage resulted in finding a large quantity of marijuana and some cocaine. \nApplicant claimed he had no knowledge of drug activity at his home. He had recently \nbeen out of town attending a pro football game and his work location was approximately \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n70 miles from his home so during the week he stayed at a rented room he had at his \nwork location. Additionally, he had given out three keys to his house to friends because \nhe had been burglarized before when he was away. Despite these facts and upon the \nadvice of his attorney, he entered into a plea agreement where three charges were \ndismissed and he pleaded to the facilitation charge. Before he agreed to the plea, his \nattorney advised him that because the law of the state created a legal presumption that \nhome and car owners were presumed to know the contents of their homes and cars, it \nwould be difficult to win at trial with an argument that he had no knowledge of the drug \nactivity. (Tr. 45-57) \nThe record contains no evidence of any prior drug activity by Applicant and he \ntestified that he has not been involved with any drug or criminal activity since his \nconviction in May 2017. (Tr. 50, 82) \nTo understand the sequence of events as they impact the allegation that \nApplicant failed to report his arrest and conviction, I find the following timeline existed: \nApril 2010 to May 31, 2017--Applicant was employed by C1. (GE 1); \nOctober 21, 2016--Applicant arrested at his home on drug charges. \n(GE 5); \nAfter the October 2016 arrest--Applicant\u2019s attorney advised him not to \ndisclose the arrest until after judgment was entered on his plea \nagreement. (Tr. 59); \nMay 12, 2017--Applicant pleaded guilty to the facilitation charge and a \njudgment was entered against him. (GE 4); \nMay 31, 2017--Applicant completes a job application and background \ncheck for C2, who has replaced C1 on the government contract \nApplicant is working on. In the application, Applicant disclosed that he \nwas convicted of facilitation and that he was sentenced to six months\u2019 \nprobation and fines. He listed the place of the conviction and offered to \nprovide more information, if needed. (Tr. 59; AE K); \nJune 1, 2017--Applicant is hired by C2 (Tr. 79; GE 3 (p.7)); \nAugust 1, 2017--Applicant is hired by C3, his current employer. No \nemployment application is offered into evidence. Applicant testified \nthat he filled out an application, which did not include a request to \nsupply any criminal history. There was no evidence to the contrary. \n(Tr. 65-66); \nAugust 2, 2017--C3 is made aware of Applicant\u2019s October 2016 arrest \nwhen Applicant\u2019s common access card (CAC) is stolen and needed \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreplacing. The information was apparently supplied by C2 to the \nsecurity office of C3. Applicant was questioned by a C3 employee \nabout why he could not be issued a new CAC. Applicant disclosed the \nOctober 2016 criminal incident. (GE 2); \nAugust 3, 2017\u2014A Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) \nincident report prepared for the database. (GE 2); \nDecember 21, 2017\u2014Applicant completes his SF 86 as an employee \nof C3. He details his arrest and conviction in the document. (GE 1) \nNo evidence was presented nor request for administrative notice made about any \nemployer rule, procedure, or practice; or government regulation or rule that created the \nduty for Applicant to report his criminal history to his employer. \nApplicant presented evidence showing that he has received numerous work \nawards, been selected for employer-sponsored training, and his interim 2019 work \nappraisal stated that he had an excellent work ethic. He is a contributor to his local \ncommunity, to include providing monetary donations to his church and by volunteering \nto help with disabled veterans\u2019 activities. (AE C-F; SOR Answer) \nApplicant also presented character letters from a work supervisor, a coworker, \ntwo pastors, and two personal friends. They vouch for his professionalism, integrity, and \ndependability. His work supporters request granting of his clearance. His pastors and \nfriends describe him as a good person whom they trust unconditionally. (AE L) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with four drug offenses in October 2016, for \nwhich he pled guilty to one facilitation charge and was convicted and sentenced to \nprobation in May 2017. I find that the stated disqualifying condition applies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal charge occurred over five years ago. Since then he has not \nhad any additional criminal allegations against him. He successfully completed his \nprobationary term without incident and his conviction was set aside in 2019. He is \npursuing a master\u2019s degree program. He is active in his community. These are sufficient \nactivities and this is a sufficient period to show his productive rehabilitative efforts. Both \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleged that Applicant failed to timely report his October 2016 arrest \nand his May 2017 conviction to his employer as required. It is clear from the plain \nlanguage of AG \u00b6\u00b615 and 16 that that those provisions apply when a person is \nundergoing the \u201cnational security investigative or adjudicative processes.\u201d Applicant was \nnot going through those processes at the time of his arrest or his conviction. The \nGovernment has failed to establish by evidence or administrative notice that there was \nsome other duty established by either an employer or the Government that required \nApplicant to report this information. Even if there were such a duty, there is also no \nevidence that Applicant was made aware of that duty. Finally, Applicant did report his \ncriminal history in his employment application in May 2017 when he applied for a \nposition with C2. Additionally, he fully reported this information when he completed his \nSF 86 for C3 in December 2017. The evidence presented shows that these are the first \ntwo occasions he had to inform his employer about his criminal history that fell within \nthe \u201cnational security investigative or adjudicative processes.\u201d Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and \n16(a)-16(c) do not apply to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 2.b, which is a cross-allegation of his criminal conviction as \npersonal conduct, based upon the general personal security concern in AG \u00b6 15 and the \nspecific concern expressed in AG \u00b6 16(c), Applicant\u2019s conviction raises questions about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nFor the same reasons expressed above in the application of the criminal conduct \nmitigating conditions, Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct concerns under AG \n\u00b6 17(c) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s good character, his community involvement, his successful completion of \nprobation, and his clean record since his conviction. The criminal conduct and personal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated all the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph      1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs     2.a - .2.b: \nFor Applicant  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented two witnesses, and \nsubmitted Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 13, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 40 years old. He is a process management team lead for a defense \ncontractor. He is divorced and has three children. He obtained his undergraduate degree \nin 2012. (Tr.33) He has been with his current employer since March 2020. He has held \nhis current clearance since 2004. (GX 1) He completed his most recent security clearance \napplication in March 2016. \nThe Statement of Reasons alleges under Guideline G, SOR 1.a, in June 2009, \nApplicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI); 1.b, in March \n2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI; and 1.c, in January 2018, arrested \nand charged with DUI. In addition, the SOR alleges under Guideline J, 2.a, information \nas set forth under paragraph one. \nAlcohol Consumption \nApplicant has been a social drinker since the age of sixteen while in high school. \nHe would typically drink rum and coke. He stated that he would have two drinks in a sitting \nonce per week to three times per month. In a 2010 subject interview, Applicant stated has \nnever had any problem reducing his consumption. (GX 3) Within the past ten years he \nhas been arrested in alcohol-related-vehicular incidents three times. Applicant admitted \nthe allegations and provided explanations. (Answer to SOR) \nAs to SOR 1.a, Applicant admitted that he showed poor judgment and immaturity \nby overindulging in alcohol. He was with friends at a restaurant and had several drinks. \nHe had a friend drive him to his car. He sat in the driver\u2019s side, the engine was running \nand he fell asleep in the parked car. He stated that he was waiting for another friend to \narrive to drive him home. He claimed that he was tired but not intoxicated. A police officer \nknocked on his car window and asked Applicant to step out of the car. Applicant does not \nremember if he was administered a sobriety test. The case disposition was Nolle \nProsequi. (GX 5) \nAs to SOR 1.b, Applicant admitted that again he showed poor judgment and \nimmaturity. In 2014, he was returning from a happy hour after he had consumed alcohol. \nIn his interview he stated that he should not have been driving, but at the time he \nunderestimated the influence of alcohol on his driving. He drove to a fast-food restaurant, \nand when he left the parking lot, he found himself driving the wrong way on the highway. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Tr. 77) He was pulled over by the police and was administered a sobriety test. He failed \nthe test and was arrested and charged with DUI. At the court date, the arresting officer \ndid not appear. The court later dropped charges and he was acquitted. (GX 3; GX 6) \nAs to SOR 1.c, Applicant was arrested in January 2018, and charged with DUI. He \npled guilty and was placed on probation before judgment (PBJ). He completed his \nprobation in May 2020. He completed a 12-hour drug and alcohol awareness class on \nOctober 15, 2020. (AX A) He also completed a 20-week classroom alcohol and drug \ntreatment program on August 10, 2018. An ignition interlock was placed on his vehicle in \n2018, and there were no reported violations. (Tr. 88) \nApplicant continues to drink about once every few months. (Tr. 93). He drinks a \nglass of wine or a bourbon and coke. (Tr. 93) He recalls drinking about a month ago. The \namounts are sometimes a half glass of wine or a sip of a drink. Since September 2020, \nhe has participated in weekly therapy sessions, with a focus on how his misuse of alcohol \nhas been detrimental to him in the past, and family counseling. (Tr.90). In an October \n2020 report, his therapist notes that there is no indication that he is making unhealthy \nchoices. (AX B) Applicant believes the 2018 conviction was a wake-up call. (Tr. 96) He \nwas emphatic that he was told not to drink and drive, but he was never told not to drink in \nthe future. (Tr.107) He has never attended AA meetings. (Tr.111) \nA friend of Applicant, who has known him since childhood, testified at the hearing \nthat she knew the reason for the hearing and that Applicant told her about his arrests for \nDUI. (Tr.20) She understands that Applicant is still consuming alcohol. (Tr. 21) She does \nnot believe that he has a problem with alcohol. The witness testified that she recommends \nApplicant for a security clearance because she believes that he would not put himself in \na situation that might result in an alcohol-related incident. (Tr. 23) \n \nAnother witness testified that she has been dating Applicant for about two years. \nThey are in a serious relationship. She is aware of Applicant\u2019s DUI\u2019s and the reason for \nthe security clearance hearing. (Tr. 120) She claims that he does not drink at all and then \nsupplemented that with maybe once a month.  She stated that he wants to remain healthy \nand be a role model for his children. The witness stated that Applicant is trustworthy and \nexemplifies good character.  \nApplicant submitted five letters of reference. Each letter attests to Applicant\u2019s work \nintegrity, professionalism, and responsibility. His program manager believes Applicant \nencompasses every quality that a person who holds a security clearance should possess. \n(AX C) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \nThe SOR (2.a) cross-alleges the information alleged in 1.a through 1.c. Applicant \nadmitted to all SOR allegations in paragraph 1. \nApplicant admitted his 2009, 2014 and 2018 arrests for DUI charges. He \ncompleted his probation for the 2018 conviction in May 2020. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Five conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant admitted that he overindulged in alcohol and showed poor judgment in \n2009 and 2014, but provided explanations that either he was not driving or that he has \nlearned from the time that has passed. In January 2018, he received a PBJ, which he \ncompleted in May 2020. These incidents that involved drinking are cross-alleged under \nGuideline J. Applicant admits he misused alcohol but completed alcohol treatment in \n2018. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, \nand shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant acknowledges that alcohol was causing problems in his life. He has had \nthree alcohol-related incidents in nine years. He completed probation in 2020 and \ncomplied with the alcohol-education programs. However, he was not allowed to drink after \nthe 2018 incident and has recently completed the probation . He still consumes some \nalcohol, although he has modified the amount and frequency. He was vague about when \nand how much he drinks. He submitted information from his therapist, who states that he \nis attending family counseling with some focus on alcohol. He does not attend AA \nmeetings. It is too early to know if there is an established track record of responsible \nalcohol use that would not lead to another occurrence. The therapist\u2019s report stated that \nApplicant admitted how alcohol has affected his life, but she also stated that it has been \na short time in which they have discussed the impact of the counseling. The fact that he \ncontinues to drink and asserts that he was never told that he could not drink, is reason to \nraise doubt about an established pattern of modified consumption of alcohol. His latest \nincident was in January 2018. He has not mitigated the security concern under the alcohol \nguideline. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \nand \nAs discussed under Alcohol Consumption, Applicant has three alcohol-related \nvehicular incidents. The latest was in 2018 and he has recently completed probation. The \nevidence establishes the above two disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct concerns. His pattern of \nevery few years and his various explanations do not convince me of successful \nrehabilitation. He has been addressing his alcohol disorder but it is not \nunreasonable to expect a longer period of time to show that he has fully mitigated \nthe concerns under this guideline. He receives partial credit for his treatment and \nhis good efforts. He has a good recommendation from his employer, but his 2018 \ninvolvement in an alcohol-related incident negates full mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is respected by those \nthat know him. He performs well at work. He has worked at his current employment and \nreceived awards. He has held a security clearance since 2004. He has excellent letters \nof recommendation. He admitted and obtained help for his alcohol problems. He \nacknowledged that he is not the same person as before. He successfully completed \noutpatient programs. He is described as a good father. \nApplicant however has had alcohol incidents in 2009, 2014, and 2018. He tried to \ndistance himself from the first two due to circumstances. Every few years, he has found \nhimself in a similar situation. He states that he can drink and has changed his habits and \nwould not drink and drive. He has made great strides, but the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance at this time. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines G and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility is denied. \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He justified his actions by stating that the document was \nimproperly marked, without a classified cover sheet, and that the information should not \nhave been classified because it was in the public domain and readily available through \nthe Internet. He also stated that his locked briefcase was the functional equivalent of a \ncourier bag.

Most, if not all, of the information about Applicant\u2019s employment history came \nfrom him in his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), during his \nbackground interview, in response to interrogatories, in his SOR response, and during \nhis testimony. \nApplicant was terminated from a job in July 2004 for unsatisfactory performance \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a). He wrote that he \u201cwas terminated after [his] manager missed an important \nmeeting because he had something more important to do at his home.\u201d Applicant \nexplained that his manager could not attend a meeting and the customer was unhappy \nwith how Applicant handled the meeting. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2). \nApplicant was terminated from another job in March 2005 for not complying with \nhis manager\u2019s directions (SOR \u00b6 2.b).

(Tr. at 81-84; \nAE E, F) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s history of traffic offenses and workplace problems, including a \nsecurity violation and multiple terminations for problematic conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. His conduct also \ncreated vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) \nare applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable to the allegation that he was \nterminated in 2013 for the security violation that is alleged under Guideline K because \nthat conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the handling protected \ninformation guideline. However, the general concerns about questionable judgment and \nan unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) \nare established. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant was terminated from a job in July 2008. There is \nno evidence in the record that the termination was for conduct that would raise a \nsecurity concern. SOR \u00b6 2.c is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 2.i alleges that Applicant was terminated from employment in October \n2016 for failure to meet expectations. His security clearance was unable to be \nprocessed because of the 2013 security incident. The underlying conduct is already \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.f. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 2.i is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nWith the exception of the security violation, which is serious on its own, any one \ninstance of Applicant\u2019s conduct would be unlikely to rise to the level of a security \nconcern. Many people with security clearances have received traffic violations or been \nterminated from jobs. However, Applicant\u2019s conduct cannot be looked at on an \nindividual or piecemeal basis. Collectively, his conduct reveals an individual who \nrepeatedly showed an unwillingness to comply with the law, rules, and regulations; who \nexercised poor judgment; and who failed to accept responsibility for his actions. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. The above mitigating factors are insufficient to dispel the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern for handling protected information is set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information-raises doubt \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security \nconcern. \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \nand \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s security violation as described above establishes the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate handling protected information security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 35. The following are potentially applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nSecurity violations are one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or \nrevoking access to classified information, as they raise serious questions about an \napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Once it is established that an \napplicant has committed a security violation, he or she has a very heavy burden of \ndemonstrating that he or she should be entrusted with classified information. Because \nsecurity violations strike at the very heart of the industrial security program, an \nadministrative judge must give any claims of reform and rehabilitation strict scrutiny. In \nmany security clearance cases, applicants are denied a clearance for having an \nindicator of a risk that they might commit a security violation (e.g., alcohol abuse, \ndelinquent debts, or drug use). Security violation cases reveal more than simply an \nindicator of risk. See ISCR Case No. 03-26888 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2006). \nThere is only one Guideline K allegation and that occurred more than seven \nyears ago. Had that been the only incident of poor judgment and Applicant accepted full \nresponsibility for his conduct, he might have met the heavy burden discussed above. \nHowever, there are many incidents of poor judgment, including the February 2018 \nincident in which he was terminated for violating rules by walking around in a federal \nbuilding without an escort, and he has minimized and attempted to justify his conduct. \nWhile there is some evidence of mitigation, Applicant\u2019s problematic history and failure to \naccept responsibility make it difficult to conclude that the conduct is completely \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence, but the favorable information is insufficient to overcome \nhis incidents involving questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and handling protected information security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.d-2.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.j-2.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant has over $78,000 in past-due student loans and other debts. These \nfacts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift \nthe burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are continuing, and his \nfinancial issues are clearly not under control. Financial Considerations is found against \nApplicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. One conditions clearly applies: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \nApplicant has four DUI convictions covering the period between 1997 and 2018, \na period of 18 years.. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One condition may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s last DUI conviction was four years prior to the issuance of the SOR. \nWhen coupled with his three prior alcohol-related convictions, it is too soon to find that \nApplicant\u2019s Alcohol Consumption is not of security concern. Guideline G is found \nagainst Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He has not met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guidelines for financial considerations and alcohol \nconsumption. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 are \nadmitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 67-year-old employee of a defense contractor, employed since 2018. \nHe served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1989 to 2002, and on active duty in the U.S. \nArmy from 2002 to 2015, when he retired. He received an honorable discharge and retired \nat the rank of Chief Warrant Officer 3. He also served in a foreign country military from \n1969 to 1987, before he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He reported attending college \nat two universities, but not receiving a degree. He married in 1982 and has two adult \nchildren. He does not currently hold a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline K that in June 2015, while serving on active duty \nin the U.S. Army, Applicant received a general officer memorandum of reprimand \n(GOMR) for improperly transporting and storing classified information and for possessing \nsix government computers at his residence, both in violation of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ); and that his local access was suspended in about October 2014. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) The SOR also alleges that Applicant was unable to account for a classified \ngovernment external hard drive, and that when he was requested to return the hard drive, \nhe substituted a different drive that contained another agency marking and the remnants \nof a \u201csecret\u201d sticker. Applicant was unable to explain how he gained possession of the \nagency hard drive. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his 2018 SCA by \ndisclosing his reprimand and claiming that it was for \u201cslack observation of security policy,\u201d \nwhen in fact it was a reprimand for negligence and failure to maintain the standards \nexpected of a U.S. Army Officer and [agency] technician after over 4,000 documents and \nimagery files classified as SECRET, TOP SECRET/SCI, or otherwise classified/protected \nwere found on government computers and other media stored in his private residence, \nas described in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) The SOR also alleges Applicant falsified his 2018 \nSCA by deliberately failing to disclose that his security eligibility/access authorization was \nsuspended in about October 2014. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) \nFinally, the SOR alleges that Applicant concealed and misrepresented material \nfacts during the course of his personal subject interview, conducted by a government \nsecurity investigator in October 2018 and February 2019, by stating that the reprimand \nfor \u201cslack observation of security policy\u201d listed in his SCA, concerned taking a personal \ncell phone into a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) where he was \nworking, and that \u201cthere were no adverse finding from the searches\u201d of his property.

The investigation into these matters was terminated \nin December 2015 after Applicant refused to cooperate with U.S. Army Intelligence (USAI) \ninvestigators. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) Applicant answered the SOR by \u201cadmitting\u201d certain facts with \nexplanations; however, he did not admit the SOR allegations as presented. (Ans.) \nTherefore, I will consider Applicant\u2019s answer as a general denial of the SOR allegations \nbut with explanatory testimonial evidence. \nIn June 2013, Applicant\u2019s unit conducted an \u201cAR 15-6\u201d investigation into allegations \nof potential security violations against Applicant. The investigation concluded that \nApplicant committed security violations under Army regulations. Applicant worked in a \nSCIF and had access to classified documents and data. In November 2012, a systems \nand hardware inventory was conducted in the SCIF where Applicant worked, and \ndiscovered that an external hard drive that \u201cmay have once been under the control\u201d of \nApplicant was not accounted for. Applicant had been seen plugging a similar hard drive \ninto his classified (SIPR) computer days prior to the inspection. A coworker also saw \nApplicant use a hard drive marked \u201cunclassified\u201d that he retrieved from his personal \nbackpack and insert it into a classified computer. Applicant\u2019s coworkers suspected that \nthe hard drive was the same drive missing from the SCIF, as they often saw the hard \ndrive plugged into Applicant\u2019s computer during the day, but sometimes missing at night. \n(Item 6) \nIn November 2012, a 100% entry and exit inspection was conducted inside the \nSCIF. When Applicant approached the inspection area and observed workers emptying \nout their pockets for inspection, Applicant dropped his backpack off at the inspection site \nand abruptly headed back toward his work area. When he returned to retrieve his \nbackpack, it was searched, and a stack of loose CDs were found. Some were marked \nSECRET/NOFORN. Applicant explained that he was taking the CDs to another office, but \nhe was instructed that classified CDs could not be transported inside a personal backpack \nand that he needed a proper container for such purposes. After permitting Applicant to \ntake the CDs to the office, it was later discovered that he never left them at the office as \nhe claimed. \nAn inspection of the SCIF also found Applicant\u2019s cell phone in his desk drawer, \nwhich is prohibited inside a SCIF. Upon questioning, Applicant admitted to having an \nunauthorized cell phone in the SCIF, improperly transporting classified media in his \npersonal belongings, uploading an unclassified hard drive into a classified system, and \nuploading an improperly labeled CD in a classified system. \nApplicant denied having any knowledge of the missing hard drive, but claimed\nanother hard drive with a classified sticker that he was using in the SCIF was \u201cscrubbed\u201d \nand he took it home. He was asked to retrieve the hard drive from his home. He returned\nwith a hard drive with the classified sticker scratched off but with another sticker in it\nshowing it was from a government agency. The investigator determined that this was not\nthe same hard drive that was missing from the SCIF.

In his garage, investigators found six \nGovernment desktop computers and monitors, and 13 black cases containing agency \nCDs. Applicant had arranged for the computer equipment to be shipped to another \nlocation, but his possession of the equipment at his residence was not authorized. Some \nof the equipment contained files marked as limited distribution, including NATO \nUnclassified, NATO Restricted, and NATO SECRET. Applicant\u2019s personal media devices \ncontained a large number of highly classified documents with markings as high as TOP \nSECRET/NOFORN. In all, Applicant possessed over 4,000 documents and imagery files \nclassified up to TOP SECRET/SCI and 86 archived files which contained material marked \nSECRET on government and personal computers and media storage devices at his \nresidence. Applicant admitted bringing a personal, unauthorized cell phone into the SCIF, \nimproper handling and safeguarding classified and protected information, personally \ndeclassifying media devices without proper authority, and intentionally taking and \ntransporting classified media to his personal residence. \nAlthough investigators did not find evidence that Applicant transferred information \nto an unauthorized individual or entity, foreign or otherwise, he did connect his \ngovernment computers to the internet at various times and he had a Skype contact list \nwith 17 entries for users in foreign countries. Over 20 USB and external storage devices \nhad been connected to Applicant\u2019s laptop at some time, many of which were not included \nin the original seizure. Applicant generally denied to Army investigators any wrongdoing \nor intentional possession of classified information. He voluntarily permitted initial \ninspection, but denied permission for an enhanced inspection of his devices by a \nspecialized cyber counterintelligence office. Investigators obtained a command search \nauthorization instead. (Items 6 and 7) According to Applicant\u2019s JPAS incident history, his \nlocal access was suspended during the investigation on or about October 2014, and \nremained suspended. Applicant\u2019s commander recommended his security clearance be \nrevoked on or about October 2015. (Item 5) \nOn June 19, 2015, Applicant received a General Officer Memorandum of \nReprimand (GOMR) from his commanding general. He was reprimanded for improperly \ntransporting and storing classified information, possessing six government computers at \nhis residence, in violation of the UCMJ.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

He received a GOMR from an Army general officer, \nand was suspended from local access. Applicant\u2019s wrongful conduct in 2012 and 2013, \nwhile working with substantial classified information, was of such a nature as to cast \nserious doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. His recent efforts to \nminimize or obscure his past questionable conduct while reapplying for a security \nclearance compound the doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Based on the record, I am not convinced that Applicant fully appreciates the \nseriousness of his past questionable conduct, and therefore I am not convinced that \nsimilar conduct will not continue. \nApplicant\u2019s intentional conduct with respect to protection of classified material and \npattern of security violations is indicative of a problem with security awareness and a \npersistent lapse of expected conduct while working within a classified environment. \nApplicant\u2019s SCA, personal subject interview, and Answer to the SOR did little to diminish \nmy concerns. The pattern of violations and subsequent effort to obfuscate the \ninvestigation findings and GOMR language leads me to question Applicant\u2019s future \nbehavior with respect to security awareness and following rules and regulations for the \nsafe handling of classified information. No mitigation is appropriate. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nThe record is sufficient to implicate disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and \n(b). Applicant\u2019s response to SCA question 13A showed an effort to minimize the gravity \nof his past conduct while reporting receipt of an official reprimand. While \u201cslack \nobservation of security policy\u201d may be interpreted broadly to include Applicant\u2019s conduct, \nI find that this language intentionally minimizes and obscures the conduct for which he \nwas reprimanded. I also find that he intentionally failed to report his suspended access in \nresponse to SCA section 25. Finally, I find that he intentionally concealed and \nmisrepresented material facts regarding the breath of his past security violations when \ndescribing the reason for his reprimand while being interviewed by a government security \ninvestigator. \nGuideline E includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \npersonal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and \nfound the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant\u2019s incomplete and obtuse answers to questions in his SCA, his subject \ninterview, and his failure to report his access suspension in his SCA, shows a continued \neffort to minimize or obscure his conduct and raises serious questions about his current \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntruthfulness and candor.

Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines K and E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant was an \nofficer with experience and clearances necessary for properly handling classified \ninformation in sensitive spaces. The pattern of security violations is indicative of a \npersistent problem that has not been shown to be rectified, and his intentional \nmisrepresentation on the SCA and during his subject interview cement my concerns \nabout his reliability and trustworthiness. The record evidence and consideration of the \nwhole-person adjudicative factors are not sufficient to overcome the handling protected \ninformation and personal conduct concerns raised in the SOR. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n  Subparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 52 years old. He is a high school graduate and has some college credits, but not a degree. He married in 1993 and has four children, ages 28, 26, 23, and 17. They all live at home. The two oldest are employed. Applicant served in the Army Reserve from 1992 to 2000 and was honorably discharged in the paygrade of E-2. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since October 2016 as a mechanical engineer and currently earns approximately $97,000. He has worked in the past for other federal contractors, as an independent contractor, and in non-government jobs. His wife is also employed and currently earns approximately $100,000 per year. Applicant testified that he has held a security clearance for about 20 years. (Tr. 39-45; GE 1) Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d and 1.i. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. In December 2016, Applicant completed a security clearance application. In it he disclosed that he \u201cfailed to file by the tax deadline\u201d his federal income tax returns for 2008 through 2012 and failed to pay the taxes owed.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 13, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 8, 2020, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. A hearing had been scheduled for April 2020, but due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, it was delayed. On May 24, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing.

The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 11. Applicant and three witnesses testified on his behalf. He offered \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C. There were no objections and all of the exhibits \nwere admitted into evidence. The record was held open until June 24, 2021, to permit \nApplicant to submit additional documents, which he did. They were marked AE D through \nS. There were no objections, and they were admitted into evidence and the record closed. \n(Hearing Exhibit I) DOHA received the transcript on June 21, 2021.  \nProcedural Matters \nThe Government moved to withdraw SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g and 1.h. The \nmotion was granted. \nFindings of Fact\n \nApplicant is 52 years old. He is a high school graduate and has some college \ncredits, but not a degree. He married in 1993 and has four children, ages 28, 26, 23, and \n17. They all live at home. The two oldest are employed. Applicant served in the Army \nReserve from 1992 to 2000 and was honorably discharged in the paygrade of E-2. He \nhas worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since October 2016 as a \nmechanical engineer and currently earns approximately $97,000. He has worked in the \npast for other federal contractors, as an independent contractor, and in non-government \njobs. His wife is also employed and currently earns approximately $100,000 per year. \nApplicant testified that he has held a security clearance for about 20 years.

He denied \nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nIn December 2016, Applicant completed a security clearance application. In it he \ndisclosed that he \u201cfailed to file by the tax deadline\u201d his federal income tax returns for 2008 \nthrough 2012 and failed to pay the taxes owed. He disclosed that he \u201cmissed filing \ndeadline\u201d for tax years 2013 through 2015. He disclosed that he was currently working on \na payment plan with the IRS for tax years 2008 through 2015. He estimated he owed \napproximately $3,000 each year for tax years 2008 through 2012 and $1,000 for each \nyear from 2013 to 2015. He admitted in his answer to the SOR that he did not timely file \nstate income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2015 when he lived in two different \nstates that require income tax filings. He did not disclose this information in his SCA. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his state tax issues will not be considered for disqualifying \npurposes, but may be considered in the whole person analysis, in mitigation, and in a \ncredibility determination. (GE 1, 2) \n2 \n \nApplicant testified that when he had completed his 2016 SCA he had been in direct \ncontact with the IRS about his taxes. He said he was attempting to \u201cwork something out.\u201d \n(Tr. 96) He then said that the IRS never contacted him by email or mail after that time.

(Tr. 97) After completing his SCA, he \nfailed to file his 2017 federal income tax return and a state income tax return for the state \nhe had lived in for 10 months. (Tr. 97-99) \nIn August 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator under \noath. During the interview, he stated that he failed to file his federal taxes on time and \nwas currently working out a payment plan with the IRS for tax years 2014 through 2016. \nHe indicated he owed about $3,000 for each year. He admitted he had not been diligent \nwith his finances and did not consider the seriousness of not filing tax returns on time. He \nstated he contacted the IRS on March 23, 2018, and was informed he owed taxes for tax \nyears 2014 through 2016. He said his mother-in-law is a certified tax preparer, and she \nwas currently in the process of taking care of his tax returns from 2014 to 2017. He said \nhe had filed his tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2013, but not 2014 through 2016. \nApplicant told the investigator that he cannot recall having any contact with IRS officials \nprior to March 23, 2018. This contradicts his statement in his 2016 SCA where he said he \nwas currently working with the IRS on a payment plan and his testimony. In his statement \nto the investigator, he said that he attempted to contact the IRS by telephone, but never \nmade contact with a representative. He testified at his hearing that he attempted to reach \nout to the IRS, but they never got back him. (Tr. 100-102) I did not find Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony credible. \nApplicant acknowledged to the investigator that in June 2008 he filed Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy because he had approximately $50,000 of debt due to a car repossession, \nhis son\u2019s medical expenses, and student loans. He did not have a steady job at the time, \nand although his and his wife\u2019s household income was approximately $90,000, it was \nused to pay their living expenses. He stated he had no other options than to file \nbankruptcy and start fresh. (GE 5) The bankruptcy documents show the case was \ndismissed in June 2010 for failure to make plan payments. (GE 9) Applicant also filed \nChapter 13 bankruptcy in 2000 and the plan was discharged in 2005. (GE 10) Applicant \ntestified that he did not recall the earlier bankruptcy. I did not find his testimony credible. \nThis bankruptcy was not alleged in the SOR and will not be considered for disqualifying \npurposes, but may be considered for the same purposes as noted above. (Tr. 74-76, 118\u00ad\n120) \nApplicant acknowledged to the investigator he was aware of the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($13,412) for a charged-off account. He explained it was a car loan. He gave \nthe car to his son who was unable to make the payments. The car was repossessed in \n2013. He stated he intended to contact the creditor and resolve the debt. (GE 5) In his \nanswer to the SOR, he stated the debt was from the repossession that took place in 2014 \nand is being scrutinized. He hired an attorney to assist him to determine if the amount \nowed is accurate, if the debt should be dismissed; and if the amount is accurate to \ndetermine if a settlement amount or payment plan will be acceptable. Applicant testified \nthat he last had contact with the creditor in April 2020. He is determining what the best \napproach is regarding the debt. He did not provide evidence of actions he has taken to \nresolve this debt that he has been aware of for years. The debt is unresolved. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nIn response to Government interrogatories from September 2019, Applicant \ndisclosed that he had filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2013, \nbut had not filed for 2014 through 2018. He indicated the estimated amount owed for tax \nyears 2008 through 2013 was approximately $57,642, presumably this does not include \npenalties and interest. He did not indicate an amount he estimated he owed for tax years \n2014 through 2018. (Tr. 80; GE 2) \nApplicant stated in his interrogatories that he was currently working with a tax firm \nto file his federal income tax returns for 2014 through 2018, and he would have them filed \nbefore the end of 2019. He also stated he was working with the tax firm to assist with \nestablishing a repayment plan with the IRS before the end of 2019. Regarding his state \nincome tax returns, he said he was also working with the tax firm to contact the two states \nwhere he had lived and was required to file, to request information, but at that time he \nhad not received the requested documents. He provided copies of IRS Form 4506-T that \nrequests transcripts of federal tax returns for years 2008 through 2018. (Tr. 102-106; GE \n2) \nApplicant sent an email to a Government representative on October 4, 2019, as a \nsupplement to the September 2019 Government interrogatories. The email stated: \nThe attached tax documents are what the accounting firm will be filing once \nI apply my signature. Unfortunately, I have been in the process of moving \nthis week and I am not able to manually sign the documents. Please accept \nthese documents as the information requested for my security clearance \napplication. (GE 3) \nThe documents provided were for tax years 2014 through 2018 and stamped \nacross them in large bold letters was: \u201cPREVIEW COPY-DO NOT FILE.\u201d He testified that \nthe accounting firm told him the tax returns were filed in 2019. He did not provide any \ndocumentary evidence from the tax firm or explanation for why he did not have a copy for \nhis records. His testimony was he believed this tax firm was going to file his returns. He \ndid not follow up to see if they were filed. The tax returns were not filed at that time. He \ndid not reach out to the firm to set up a payment plan with the IRS because he believed \ntheir services did not include doing this. (Tr. 52-57, 102-107) I did not find his statements \ncredible. \nOn October 17, 2019, Applicant sent another email as a supplement to his \nSeptember 2019 Government interrogatories. This email stated that he anticipated having \n\u201cfeedback today on the terms of a repayment plan for the IRS.\u201d He further stated: \nThe amounts shown being owed for the years 2008-2018 are due to not \nhaving the opportunity to include any deductions for 1099 work conducted \nduring those years. These amounts would have been much less, had I taken \nadvantage of these available deductions for business expenses. (GE 4) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant offered no explanation for why he did not have the \u201copportunity\u201d to include his \ndeductions, other than he failed to file the returns and the IRS filed a substitute return for \nhim.  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2020 answer to the SOR, he stated that he never intended \nto hide any illegal tax dealings from the IRS. He further stated: \u201cI am completely in \ncompliance with the filing of all tax years at this time, and I am working with a company \ncalled (XYZ). He said XYZ is working closely with the IRS on his behalf to resolve all of \nhis prior tax obligations. He did not know the amount of his federal tax debt at that time. \nHe admitted that he failed to timely file his state income tax returns for tax years 2008 \nthrough 2015, and again XYZ was working to resolve them. He stated XYZ was working \nwith the IRS on his state returns, but presumably he meant the specific states\u2019 tax \nauthorities. (Answer to SOR). Applicant did not provide supporting tax documents with \nhis SOR Answer to show he had filed his delinquent federal or state tax returns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nOn June 6, 2021, Applicant provided an updated response to the SOR as part of \nhis evidence.

After reviewing my \ntax account with irs.gov, it was determined that the IRS has already \ncalculated a predetermined amount of liability for the years 2008 to 2013, \nso filing those tax years is no longer applicable. During further research \nregarding tax years 2014-2018, I learned that those documents had not \nbeen filed as promised by the company I was working with at the time. After \nlearning this disturbing fact, I immediately contacted a company called \n[ABC] and was able to get all of the tax years filed. I am happy to say that I \nam completely in compliance with all federal tax filings at this time, including \n2019 and 2020. (AE B) \n \nIn his updated answer to the SOR, Applicant did not provide any additional \nevidence regarding the status of his state income returns or tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.c. He reiterated the same information regarding the debt for the repossessed vehicle \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d that he did in his January 2020 answer, but provided no evidence \nof any action he has taken to resolve this debt from 2014. He stated in both his January \n2020 answer and June 2021 updated answer that he disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f \n($1,450) owed to a mobile phone carrier. In both responses, he said the debt was no \nlonger on his credit report. The debt is reported on both his February 2020 and June 2019 \ncredit reports. Applicant did not provide any proof to the contrary. This debt is not \nresolved. (Tr. 72-74; GE 6, 8; AE B) \nApplicant testified that he did not timely file his 2008 through 2018 federal income \ntax returns. He stated that he was aware that he would owe taxes for some of these years \ndue not having a sufficient amount withheld from his pay and his 1099 independent \ncontractor income.

When questioned why he said in the \nabovementioned email from October 2019 as a supplement to his interrogatories that he \ndid file them, he said that he had been told by his accountant that they were filed. He did \nnot provide copies of the returns. When asked if he contacted the tax professionals to \nretrieve a copy, he said he had not. Throughout the hearing I did not find Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony credible or believable. Based on the documentary evidence provided by both \nthe Government and Applicant, he repeatedly made claims that were not true. (Tr. 48, 65-\n68) \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided documents to show that on June 9, 2021, he \nmailed his 2014 through 2020 federal income tax returns to the IRS. A week before his \nhearing, Applicant hired a new tax professional. Based on the tax professional\u2019s \ncalculations, presumably not including penalties and interest, he owes $66,009 for those \ntax years. I will not consider for disqualifying purposes that Applicant filed his 2019 federal \ntax return late, but may consider it as noted above. Applicant testified that he failed to \ntimely file his 2019 federal income tax return because he and his wife wanted to figure \nout what the best way to file jointly. (Tr. 59-63, 69-71, 108-109; AE E through L) \nIn addition, Applicant provided documents to show his 2011 federal income tax \nreturn was filed in September 2012 - balance owed is $6,771; 2012 was filed in November \n2013 \u2013 balance owed is $7,747; 2013 filed in June 2015 \u2013 balance owed is $8,082. The \napproximate total tax owed for these years is $22,600. He did not provide an explanation \nfor why he failed to pay his taxes for these years. He did not provide additional information \nas to the current status of his delinquent state income tax returns. They remain \nunresolved. (AE D, M, N. O) \nApplicant stated he was unable to retrieve the tax transcripts for tax years 2008 \nthrough 2010. He assumed it was because they were older than ten years. Applicant \ntestified that he believed he owes about $20,000 in federal income taxes for the past two \ntax years (2019 and 2020) in addition to the previous amounts discussed. His federal \nincome tax debt is likely over $100,000. When asked how he intended to pay the amount, \nhe stated that the tax professionals at ABC will continue to work on his behalf and with \nthe IRS to reach a payment agreement and get the amount he owes reduced. He hopes \nto have his debt to the IRS paid within five years. He provided copies of forms increasing \nhis federal income tax withholding, a power of attorney for his tax representative, tax \nrepresentative authorization, and payment receipts to his tax professional. (AE D, P, Q, \nR, S) \nApplicant and his wife own rental property in another state that they purchased in \n2006. He estimated it is valued at approximately $340,000 and they owe about $188,000 \non the mortgage. In 2011 and 2014, Applicant had debt canceled and received IRS 1099C \nforms for approximately $21,000 and $39,000 respectively. Applicant and his wife \npurchased a house in October 2019 and their monthly mortgage payment is $2,750. \nApplicant testified that he has no money in his savings account and approximately $4,000 \nin his checking account.

(Tr. 117-128; GE 4, 11) \nThree character witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. He was described as \nan upstanding citizen with integrity. He volunteers at his church and is a Christian family \nman. He is a person that can be trusted as a friend, colleague, and employee. He is calm, \nand fair. He can be trusted and is a person who can be relied upon. His witnesses believe \nhe should continue to hold a security clearance, and they have never had a reason to \nbelieve he is any kind of threat or concern to the United States. (Tr. 28-39) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2008 through \n2018. He failed to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2015. He is \nindebted to the IRS for past due taxes in the amount of at least approximately $71,726. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe has a delinquent debt from 2014 for a car repossession.

Applicant filed Chapter \n13 bankruptcy in 2008 and it was dismissed in 2010 for failure to make payments. There \nis sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has a long history of failing to timely file his federal income tax returns \nand pay the taxes he owes. He has repeatedly mislead the Government about his actions \nregarding his tax issues. In his 2016 SCA, he indicated he was working with the IRS on \na payment plan, which was untrue. After being placed on notice through his SCA that \ntaxes were a Government concern, he failed to timely file his 2016, 2017, and 2018 \nfederal income tax returns. He sent emails to the Government indicating his tax returns \nwere being filed and then failed to follow up on their status. Applicant was again on notice \nwhen he received the SOR in 2019 about the Government\u2019s concerns. He eventually filed \nhis delinquent federal income tax returns a day before his rescheduled hearing.

Despite being aware that his vehicle was repossessed in \n2014, Applicant continues to delay taking any action on this debt that is now seven years \nold. He failed to provide evidence that he resolved a debt to a cellphone company. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. They did not occur under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. To the contrary, he has established a pattern of \nfailing to file and pay his federal income taxes for many years. His repeated conduct casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems were within his control. There is no evidence he has received financial \ncounseling. He has sought the services of a tax professional to help him resolve his past \ntax issues. He has not made a good-faith effort to repay his delinquent taxes or other \ndebts. He continues to procrastinate in resolving the debt for his repossessed vehicle. He \nfailed to provide evidence he has a legitimate dispute regarding his delinquent debts and \nhas not offered evidence of actions to resolve them. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) \ndo not apply. Despite stating in the past that he was working with the IRS regarding a \npayment plan, he has failed to produce one. He is working with a tax professional with \nhopes of securing a plan in the future, but at this juncture he does not have one. AG \u00b6 \n20(g) applies only to the extent that Applicant has mailed his delinquent federal tax returns \nto the IRS. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old. He has a history of financial problems. He made minimal \nefforts to file his delinquent federal income tax returns for many years. Despite being on \nnotice after completing his 2016 SCA, he failed to timely file his 2016 through 2019 federal \nincome tax returns. They were not completed until a day before his hearing. He has not \nmade any payments on his federal tax debt. His delinquent state tax returns remain \nunfiled. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to file his \nfederal tax returns, state tax returns, and to pay his income taxes raises serious concerns. \nHis failure to pay a creditor he owes after seven years is also a concern. The record \nevidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.e  \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g-1.h: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n1 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2010 through 2017 tax years (SOR 1.a); that for those same tax years he owed $325,065 in delinquent taxes (SOR 1.b); that he owed [REDACTED] (State A) $34,841 pursuant to a tax lien filed against him in 2017 (SOR 1.c); and that he owed [REDACTED] (State B) $94,921 for unpaid income tax (SOR 1.d). Additionally, it was alleged that Applicant owed $6,437 for two delinquent credit card accounts (SOR 1.e and 1.f). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.e and 1.f. He denied SOR 1.c, claiming the State A tax lien has been satisfied. He denied SOR 1.d, claiming that the current balance on the State B tax debt is now significantly lower and that a prior garnishment of his earnings to satisfy the debt has been rescinded. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 57 years old and works for a defense contractor in a position that requires eligibility for access to classified information. He was hired by his current employer in State A in February 2021 after working between April 2013 and December 2020 at a defense contractor located in [REDACTED] (State C). Prior to that, he worked for another defense contractor, also in State C, between August 2006 and April 2013. Applicant first received a security clearance in 1982 while serving on act",

Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) could not determine, as required \nby Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2, that it is clearly consistent with the interests \nof national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nOn January 21, 2020, DCSA CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The guideline cited in the SOR was part of the \ncurrent set of adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence \non December 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I \nreceived the case on June 29, 2021, and convened the requested hearing on August 5, \n2021. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 9. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A - G. All \nexhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non August 13, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for the 2010 through 2017 tax years (SOR 1.a); that for those \nsame tax years he owed $325,065 in delinquent taxes (SOR 1.b); that he owed \n[REDACTED] (State A) $34,841 pursuant to a tax lien filed against him in 2017 (SOR \n1.c); and that he owed [REDACTED] (State B) $94,921 for unpaid income tax (SOR 1.d). \nAdditionally, it was alleged that Applicant owed $6,437 for two delinquent credit card \naccounts (SOR 1.e and 1.f). \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.e \nand 1.f. He denied SOR 1.c, claiming the State A tax lien has been satisfied. He denied \nSOR 1.d, claiming that the current balance on the State B tax debt is now significantly \nlower and that a prior garnishment of his earnings to satisfy the debt has been rescinded. \n(Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 57 years old and works for a defense contractor in a position that \nrequires eligibility for access to classified information. He was hired by his current \nemployer in State A in February 2021 after working between April 2013 and December \n2020 at a defense contractor located in [REDACTED] (State C). Prior to that, he worked \nfor another defense contractor, also in State C, between August 2006 and April 2013. \nApplicant first received a security clearance in 1982 while serving on active duty in the \nmilitary between April 1982 and April 1988, when he was honorably discharged. His \nclearance was renewed for civilian work in 1989 and 2002. (GX 1) \nApplicant disclosed in his e-QIP that he owed State B $30,000 in unpaid income \ntaxes because he had not filed his State B income tax returns for the 2012 and 2013 tax \n2 \n\n \nyears, and that his pay was being garnished to satisfy that debt. He further disclosed that \nState B had placed a lien against a house in State B that he and his wife occupied \nbetween 1999 and 2013, when Applicant relocated for new employment in State A. State \nB obtained the lien on Applicant\u2019s house as part of its effort to enforce Applicant\u2019s income \ntax debt. As a result of the lien, Applicant was unable to sell the house when he moved \nto State A, and the mortgage on that house was foreclosed in June 2015. Applicant does \nnot owe any remainder after foreclosure, but he did not explain why he could not stay \ncurrent on his mortgage payments. In response to the SOR, Applicant provided \ninformation that showed his wages were previously garnished by State B to satisfy a debt \nfor unpaid taxes for the 2005 through 2008 tax years. That garnishment was released in \nMarch 2018; however, another garnishment was implemented to recoup unpaid taxes \nfrom the 2010, 2011, and 2012 tax years.

Also, he has not filed his past-\ndue returns; rather, State B tax authorities filed them without input from him. Applicant\u2019s \npay was involuntarily garnished from 2013 until he left his previous job in December 2020. \nAfter he started his current job in February 2021, he contacted State B tax authorities and \nestablished a voluntary monthly repayment plan which began in March 2021. Applicant \nestimates he still owes about $47,000 in unpaid State B taxes. (Answer; AX F; Tr. 50 \u2013 \n52) \nApplicant did not timely file his income tax returns as required in State A, where he \nhas lived since November 2013, for the 2013 through 2017 tax years. As a result, and as \nalleged in SOR 1.c, Applicant incurred a $34,841 debt for unpaid taxes. The state \ngarnished his wages to satisfy that debt. On or about April 13, 2018, Applicant filed all of \nhis past-due State A income tax returns. He also has timely filed his State A returns since \nthe 2018 tax year. On April 23, 2018, State A reduced his wage garnishment to 10 percent \nof his income at that time. On June 11, 2019, State A released the tax lien against \nApplicant that served as the basis for the garnishment of his wages. The tax debt alleged \nin SOR 1.c has been satisfied. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 4; GX 9; Tr. 48 \u2013 50, 57) \nAs alleged at SOR 1.a, Applicant also did not file his federal income tax returns for \nthe tax years 2010 through 2017. As alleged at SOR 1.b, he incurred a $325,061 debt for \nunpaid federal taxes for those years. Available information also documents unpaid federal \ntaxes for tax years 2006 through 2008. Applicant testified that he has not yet filed any of \nthe returns addressed in SOR 1.a and he has not made any payments or other attempts \nto resolve his federal tax debt despite receiving notice of his unpaid tax debt from the IRS \non March 25, 2019. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; GX 4; GX 7; Tr. 40 \u2013 43, 79) \nApplicant asserted that he failed to file his 2010 through 2017 federal tax returns \nand his 2013 through 2017 State A returns, because he thought his wife had filed them \nas joint returns, when, in fact she filed her own returns as \u201cmarried-filing separately.\u201d He \ndid not explain why he did not file his 2006 through 2008 returns, or why he seemingly \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nwas unaware during that entire time that he had not met his federal filing obligations. \n(Answer; GX 1 \u2013 4; Tr. 85 \u2013 89, 90 \u2013 91) \nAs for his State B returns, Applicant explained, but did not corroborate, that he \ncontinued to file returns in State C, where he had lived until moving just across the state \nline to State B in December 1999. After moving, he continued to work in State C and \nthought he was supposed to continue filing there. He did not provide any documentation \nshowing that he continued to file returns in State C after 1999. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 4; Tr. 85 \n\u2013 89, 90 \u2013 91) \nSince at least 2006, Applicant has been a salaried employee whose taxes are \nwithheld and reported by his employers. His annual income since 2013 has exceeded \n$200,000 and, at times, $300,000. Applicant\u2019s personal finances are sound and he \nestimates he has about $8,000 remaining after deducting expenses from his estimated \nmonthly net income of $14,000. In 2014 and 2015, Applicant obtained professional \nassistance to resolve his tax issues, first from an accounting firm, then from a law firm. In \nboth cases, he received information and advice about how to deal with the IRS and state \ntax authorities; however, it was not until 2018 that he filed his State A returns. He never \nhimself filed his past-due State B returns. Until February 2021, all of the payments made \non his state tax debts were through involuntary wage garnishments and, more recently, \nstate diversion of his timely-filed income tax refunds starting with the 2018 tax year. (GX \n4; AX B \u2013 E; Tr. 44 \u2013 46, 58 \u2013 70, 76 \u2013 79) \nAs to the two credit card debts alleged at SOR 1.e and 1.f, Applicant asserted that \nthey have been paid, that they may be his wife\u2019s responsibility, and that he has no current \ninformation about those accounts. On July 6, 2018, Applicant was asked about both debts \nduring a personal subject interview (PSI) as part of his background investigation. He \nindicated then that he thought both accounts were paid but would check on both accounts \nand pay them off if they were still past-due. The most recent credit report available, dated \nJuly 3, 2019, shows both debts have been delinquent since at least 2015 and are still \nunresolved. (Answer; GX 1; GX 3; GX 5; Tr. 39 \u2013 40) \nApplicant has an excellent reputation in the workplace and his community. Letters \nof support submitted by current and former associated who have known him personally \nand professionally for up to 25 years extol his professionalism, integrity, and \ntrustworthiness. (AX G) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n4 \n\n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant did not timely file his income tax returns for at least eight consecutive tax \nyears. He also amassed debts for unpaid taxes in excess of $450,000. He has not acted \nto pay or resolve most of his unpaid taxes, as well as two credit card accounts that have \nbeen delinquent for up to seven years. This information reasonably raised a security \nconcern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s information requires \nconsideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his returns occurred over a period of at least eight years. \nHe still has not filed his federal returns and his State B returns were filed for him by state \ntax authorities. To the extent any of his tax debts have been paid, it has been almost \nentirely through involuntary wage garnishments and diversion of refunds starting with the \n2018 tax year. He still has not made any arrangements with the IRS to resolve his \n$325,000 federal tax debt. \nApplicant\u2019s stated reasons for not meeting his tax reporting and payment \nobligations were not plausible. Even if they were, they would not support a finding that his \ntax problems arose from circumstances beyond his control. Further, his failure to act in a \ntimely fashion over the past decade to file correct his filing and payment deficiencies \nshows that he did not act in a reasonable way when faced with circumstances supposedly \nbeyond his control. All of the foregoing also is true for the two credit card debts addressed \nin the SOR, especially in light of his general history of financial health, which indicates he \nhas had the resources all along to pay or otherwise resolve his debts. \nFinally, Applicant is credited with seeking professional tax assistance in 2014 and \n2015; however, he did not act on whatever advice he received therefrom for another three \nyears, when he filed his past-due State A returns. He still has not resolved his remaining \ntax reporting and payment deficiencies. \nIn summary, the record does not support application of AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions cited, above. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d).

His subsequent claims of resolving \nall listed tax issues have not been sufficiently documented under the financial \nconsiderations guideline. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 25, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP, Item 3) requesting a security clearance so that he could \nwork for a contractor. On June 11 and October 23, 2019, he provided answers to \ninterrogatories with supplemental documents concerning federal and state tax issues. The \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) could not make the necessary \naffirmative findings to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, and \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 19, 2020.

A \nmajor reason for the petition was an inability to pay his condominium mortgage as he \ncould not rent the dwelling due to a major crack in the foundation. (Item 5 at 14) Following \nApplicant\u2019s successful completion of the Chapter 13 payment plan in October 2014, the \npetition was discharged. (Item 6 at 6) One of the delinquent debts Applicant had to repay \nwas $2,834 in delinquent taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax year 2006. \n(Item 6 at 63, 67) \nSOR \u00b61.b \u2013 The allegation reads that Applicant failed to file his 2014 through \n2017 federal tax returns. As of February 19, 2020 (date of SOR), his 2015 federal tax \nreturn remained unfiled. \nApplicant indicated in his August 2017 e-QIP that he had not filed his 2015 and \n2016 federal tax returns because he was working in a foreign country. He planned to file \nthe returns by October 2017. (Item 3 at 72) Then he stated in his August 2018 PSI that \nhe could not file his returns because he was unable to produce the correct tax documents \nto the company-provided tax service. He was also swamped by work-related activities. \nHe intended to file the missing 2015 and 2016 returns by September 2018. (Item 5 at 17) \nIn his June 2019 response to interrogatories, Applicant stated that he filed his \n2015 and 2016 federal returns and he had a tax credit of $26,963. The IRS tax transcript \nfor 2015, dated May 10, 2019, reflects that no return had been filed for tax year 2015. \n(Item 4 at 4) The IRS notice to Applicant dated May 20, 2019, posts $26,963 as \nrepresenting a credit to Applicant\u2019s account for tax year 2015, but the IRS again indicated \nthat no tax return had been filed for tax year 2015. (Item 4 at 5) He revealed for the first \ntime in his October 2019 response to interrogatories that he did not file his 2014 tax return \nuntil January 2017. (Item 5 at 2) \nIn his March 2020 answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed he filed his 2015 tax \nreturn and all federal taxes were paid. The attachments to his answer show late tax \nreturns filed for 2017 and 2018. However, there are no records showing the filing of a \n2015 tax return. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 The allegation indicates that Applicant is indebted to the IRS in the \namount of $8,156 for tax year 2016. In his June 2019 responses to interrogatories, he \nfurnished his tax transcript for tax year 2016, showing that his tax return was received by \nthe IRS in March 2019. Applicant claims that he filed the federal return in February 2019, \nand owed $11,687, which he claims that he paid. Though his 2016 tax return was filed, \nhe provided no proof that he paid any taxes for 2016, neither the $8,156 as required in \nthe IRS documentation, nor $11,687, as he claims in his October 2019 responses to \ninterrogatories.

In his October 2019 responses to interrogatories, he indicated that he \nlived in two states for portions of tax year 2017. He explained that he filed two 2017 state \ntax returns in July 2019, and owed no taxes to the state agencies. However he provided \nno documentary evidence to support his claims. (Item 5 at 3). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. \n\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect sensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other public trust \nissues such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained \nby known sources of income is also a trustworthiness concern insofar as \nit may result from criminal activity, including espionage. \nPaying voluntarily-incurred debt in a timely fashion shows good judgment and \nreliability. Filing federal and state tax returns, and paying taxes on time also shows good \njudgment, while manifesting an applicant\u2019s acknowledgement of his legal obligation to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncomply with well-established rules and regulations, a key factor for those seeking security \nclearance eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19. The disqualifying condition relevant in this case are: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax as required. \nWhen Applicant did not pay his federal income taxes in 2006, he exercised poor \njudgement by not fulfilling his tax obligations as required by law. The record reflects that \nhe did not resolve the 2006 income tax issues until October 2014, when the Chapter 13 \npetition was discharged upon completion of the payment plan. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He failed to \ntimely file his federal tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2017. He filed his 2016 and \n2017 returns late, and he still has not filed his 2015 federal tax returns. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nFinally, he has produced no documentation to prove that he paid $8,156 in taxes for 2016. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) His claims of having filed the 2017 state tax returns and paid state taxes for \n2017 are unsupported by independent evidence. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) AG \u00b6\u00b6 19 (b), (c), and (f) \napply. \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 e-QIP, his 2019 responses to interrogatories, and his March \n2020 answers to the SOR establish the Government\u2019s case under the financial \nconsiderations guideline. Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion of producing \nevidence that rebuts or mitigates the Government\u2019s case and meets his burden of \ndemonstrating he warrants security clearance eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 tax issues would have been mitigated by the passage of time \nhad no similar adverse tax issues emerged since then. However, his tax issues \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreappeared when he failed to timely file his federal tax returns from 2014 through 2017. \nHe compounded his tax problems with unsubstantiated claims of having filed 2015 federal \nreturns, and paying all his taxes to both the federal and state authorities. The absence of \ncritical supporting tax documentation to validate his assertions continue to cast doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. AG 20(a) does not \napply. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) provides mitigation where an applicant provides proof that he has \nmade arrangements with the proper tax authority to file returns, and if necessary, pay the \ntaxes owed, thereby demonstrating compliance with those arrangements. Despite \nApplicant\u2019s claims that he filed his 2015 return and paid all taxes, the record evidence \nshows no proof that he filed a federal return for tax year 2015, or that he paid any taxes \nfor tax year 2016, or that he filed a state return for tax year 2017. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have carefully evaluated the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \ncontext of the entire record. Applicant is 63 years old and has worked for his employer for \nmore than 36 years in the United States and overseas. He is highly educated, having \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree, a master\u2019s degree, and an associate\u2019s degree in logistics \nmanagement. He has held a security clearance since his active duty in the USAF from \n1977 to 1986. He received an honorable discharge in June 2011 following 15 years of \nservice in the USAF Reserve. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn the other side of the equation are Applicant\u2019s recurring tax issues following \nhis successful Chapter 13 discharge in 2014.

His current \nemployer provided tax services for him to use, which he did not because he could not \nassemble the correct documents for filling. Failing to independently substantiate his \nassertions in his March 2020 answer to the SOR that he filed his 2015 federal tax return, \nand that he paid his 2016 federal taxes, and that he filed his 2017 state return, he has \nfailed the mitigate the continuing security concerns raised in the SOR. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant a \nsecurity clearance. \nPaul J.

The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on January 17, 2020, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 3, 2020. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nNotice of Hearing on October 6, 2020.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with a defense contractor since 1989. He has held a security clearance since \n1989. (TR at page 15 line 22 to page 17 line 18, and GX 2 at page 7.) He is married, \nand has two adult children. (TR at page 15 line 22 to page 17 line 18, and GX 2 at \npages 15, 17 and 18.) \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol at about 15 years of age, and started having \n\u201cdrinking problems\u201d at the age of 18. (TR at page 17 line 20 to page 18 line 13.) His first \nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) incident occurred about 1988. This incident \nwas not alleged in the SOR. Applicant considers himself to be an alcoholic. (TR at page \n17 line 20 to page 19 line 14.) \n1.d. Applicant\u2019s second alcohol-related incident occurred in February of 2008, \nwhen he was charged with and pled guilty to DUI. (TR at page 19 line 15 to page 25 line \n13.) He received treatment, was diagnosed as suffering from an Alcohol Use Disorder, \nand attended Alcoholics Anonymous for two years. (Id., and TR at page 27 lines 3~8.) \n1.a. After about eight years of sobriety, Applicant returned to the consumption of \nalcohol; and as a result, received out-patient treatment for his Alcohol Use Disorder \nfrom about February 2017 to about August 2017. (TR at page 25 line 20 to page 28 line \n7, and at page 30 lines 2~8.) \n1.b. After a \u201cfew months\u201d of sobriety, Applicant again returned to the consumption \nof alcohol; and as a result, received in-patient treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder, \nSevere from about January of 2018 to about May 2018. (TR at page 28 line 10 to page \n32 line 7.) \n1.c. Despite the above mentioned in-patient and out-patient treatments, Applicant \nreturned to the consumption of alcohol. (TR at page 32 line 8 to page 35 line 5.) He \navers that he has abstained from its consumption since October of 2018, about two \nyears prior to his hearing.

Applicant used marijuana on numerous occasions from 1981 until \nabout January of 2018. (TR at page 35 line 10 to page 36 line 14.) Most of his usage \nwas prior to his being granted a security clearance, but Applicant did use the illegal \nsubstance \u201ca couple of times\u201d while holding a security clearance. (TR at page 17 lines \n9~14, at page 37 line 8 to page 38 line 18, and at page 42 lines 6~25.) \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n3.a. and 3.b. In answer to Section 23 on his October 5, 2017, SCA, Applicant \nfailed to disclose his marijuana usage. During his subsequent subject interview \nconducted under oath on January 17, 2019, Applicant continued to conceal his \nmarijuana usage. (TR at page 38 line 19 to page 39 line 11, and GX 2 at pages 29~30.) \nThis lack of candor constitutes willful falsifications. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \nApplicant has two DUIs (although one is not alleged), and has been diagnosed \non three occasions as suffering from an Alcohol Use Disorder. These facts establish \nprima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant is a recovering alcoholic, who has returned to consuming the intoxicant \non at least three occasions after in-patient and out-patient treatments. Although he \nshould be commended for his current two years of sobriety, it is too soon to conclude, in \nlight of his past history, that Applicant will not relapse. Alcohol Consumption is found \nagainst Applicant. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppellant used marijuana on numerous occasions, to include after having been \ngranted a security clearance. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (f) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana usage is fairly recent, in January of 2018. It also occurred \nwhile he held a security clearance. He has submitted no signed statement eschewing \nfuture usage. Drug Involvement is found against Applicant.  \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nApplicant falsified his 2019 SCA, and continued his ruse in a subsequent subject \ninterview. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \nThis does not apply. Applicant compounded his initial falsification with his subject \ninterview. Personal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nGuideline G, H, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the Alcohol Consumption, Drug Involvement, and Personal Conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. and 2.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a. and 3.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 45 years old. He earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in 2001 and 2003. He never married and has no children. Applicant was unemployed for four months from October 2007 to January 2008. Because of his unemployment, he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2009, and his debts were discharged in May 2014. He has been steadily employed since 2008 and has worked for his current employer since 2018. (Transcript (Tr.) 16-23, 38-41; GE 1, 3) Applicant earned approximately $45,000 in 2008 and his annual salary increased steadily to approximately $80,000 in 2016. He moved to a new state in 2016 to take a better paying job. His salary increased to approximately $88,000 and is now $90,000. He obtained two loans and three credit cards to put a down payment on a house at his new location and for moving expenses. He repaid the loans. Applicant underestimated the costs associated with his new home. He realized he was overextended. (Tr. 19-20, 24, 32-33, 51-54) From 2014 to 2016, Applicant lived in his family home that he and his sister inherited. There was an existing mortgage on the property of about $40,000 to $50,000. In 2016, Applicant refinanced the property and received about $50,000 to $60,000 in equity from the house. He spent $16,000 to satisfy his sister\u2019s tax debt. He used most of the rema",

DOHA received the hearing transcript on \nJuly 20, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 45 years old. He earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in 2001 and 2003. He \nnever married and has no children. Applicant was unemployed for four months from \nOctober 2007 to January 2008. Because of his unemployment, he filed Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in 2009, and his debts were discharged in May 2014. He has been steadily \nemployed since 2008 and has worked for his current employer since 2018. (Transcript \n(Tr.) 16-23, 38-41; GE 1, 3) \nApplicant earned approximately $45,000 in 2008 and his annual salary increased \nsteadily to approximately $80,000 in 2016. He moved to a new state in 2016 to take a \nbetter paying job. His salary increased to approximately $88,000 and is now $90,000. He \nobtained two loans and three credit cards to put a down payment on a house at his new \nlocation and for moving expenses. He repaid the loans. Applicant underestimated the \ncosts associated with his new home. He realized he was overextended. (Tr. 19-20, 24, \n32-33, 51-54) \nFrom 2014 to 2016, Applicant lived in his family home that he and his sister \ninherited. There was an existing mortgage on the property of about $40,000 to $50,000. \nIn 2016, Applicant refinanced the property and received about $50,000 to $60,000 in \nequity from the house. He spent $16,000 to satisfy his sister\u2019s tax debt. He used most of \nthe remaining money to remodel the house while he was living there. When he refinanced \nthe house it was put in his name only. When he moved, he kept the house and used it on \nweekends. In about the middle of 2018, he began to rent the house. He rented to friends \nand the monthly rental fee did not cover the mortgage and other expenses associated \nwith the house. He exhausted most of the money he had received from refinancing the \nhouse. Applicant stated he could barely afford his expenses. He then spent about $5,000 \non the house after the tenants moved because they did not maintain the house properly \nand to prepare it for sale. The house is now on the market for sale. (Tr. 30, 34-35, 41-51) \nIn 2017, Applicant was involved in four car accidents. He testified that they all were \nhis fault. Two of the accidents involved rental vehicles. In the first accident, he totaled his \ncar, and the insurance paid all but a $1,000 deductible. He purchased a new car \n(approximately $45,000). At the same time, he decided to purchase a second vehicle, a \nused 2013 Cadillac for approximately $32,000, because he always wanted this model of \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncar. He then had another accident with his new car and was responsible for the \ndeductible, which was higher because of his last accident. He kept the Cadillac until July \n2018, and then surrendered it to the creditor when he no longer could make the payments. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($20,706) reflects the deficiency amount owed after the vehicle was sold. \nApplicant has not contacted the creditor or taken any action to resolve this debt. He stated \nthat after he purchased the second vehicle his finances became out of control. (Tr. 24-\n26, 54-60, 62)  \nApplicant testified that in about January or February 2018, he enrolled his debts \nwith a debt consolidation company (DCC) that advised him to stop paying his credit card \nbills, and it would negotiate settlements on his behalf. It could not include the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c because it did not qualify. He followed the advice and made payments to DCC. He \nwas to pay DCC $320 a month. He said he made payments of $600 a month, but could \nnot recall how many. He estimated it was less than a year, but more than six months. He \ndid not provide documents to show his payments. He stopped making payments to DCC \nwhen his wages were garnished due to the judgment and garnishment for the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant testified that he self-reported his financial problems to his employer. \n(Tr. 26-30, 62-69) \nIn October 2018, a judgment was entered against Applicant (SOR \u00b6 1.b - $9,946). \nApplicant\u2019s wages were garnished. The judgment was satisfied and released in June \n2020. Applicant testified that the garnishment impacted his ability to pay his other debts. \n(Tr. 26, 36-38, 61-62; GE 6, AE A) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($8,014) was a personal loan that was charged off and later \nsettled by DCC for less than the full amount. Applicant could not recall the amount of the \nsettlement. It is reflected on his credit report and is resolved. (Tr. 70-72; GE 7; AE B) \nApplicant admitted he owes the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($7,629), 1.g ($1,132), 1.h \n($675), 1.i ($547), and 1.j (past due - $3,667). He indicated the debts were enrolled with \nDCC, but he has not made progress on resolving them. (Tr. 72-79) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,671) is reflected in Applicant\u2019s April 2018 credit report \nas a charged-off account in collection. Applicant testified that the debt was past due and \nhe paid it, and the account closed. He provided a July 2021 credit report that reflected \nsuch. The account is not listed on his January 2021 credit report. This debt is resolved. \n(Tr. 72-76; GE 7, GE 9; AE B). \nApplicant testified that his finances were also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic \nbecause his sister lost her job in March 2020, and he provided her $1,000 a month until \nFebruary 2021. Applicant has no money in savings. He is paying the mortgages on two \nhomes, along with the expenses associated with them. He said that he has cut back on \nhis lifestyle in an attempt to reduce his living expenses. He intends to address his debts \nin the short-term by saving and paying his creditors and in the long-term by selling his \nfamily home.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had his debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2014. He has numerous \ndelinquent debts that remain unresolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to unexpected expenses associated \nwith moving and purchasing a new house, for which he took out loans and used credit \ncards. His problems were exacerbated when he purchased a second vehicle, and when \nhe did not receive sufficient rent to cover the mortgage on a house he inherited and rented \nto friends. Applicant\u2019s poor planning regarding moving and homeowner\u2019s expenses and \nthe use of personal loans and credit cards to finance both were within his control. \nMaintaining two homes was within his control. Renting to friends for an amount that did \nnot sufficiently cover his mortgage was within his control. Applicant also attributed his \nfinancial issues to helping his sister during the pandemic. This unprecedented event left \nmany people unemployed and was not predictable. His benevolence toward his sister \nwas due to something beyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b) Applicant \nmust have acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant was already in a dire \nfinancial situation before the pandemic. He acted responsibly at one point by enrolling his \ndebts with DCC and was able to pay one. But then he stopped participating with DCC \nand failed to address his delinquent debts. His debts remain recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nApplicant resolved two debts. SOR \u00b6 1.b was resolved through garnishment after \na judgment was entered. This does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the debt. \nHe resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to this debt. There is insufficient \nevidence that Applicant participated in financial counseling and his debts are under \ncontrol or being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant became overextended when he purchased a second house where he \nmoved and did not anticipate the extra costs associated with it. He used personal loans \nand credit cards to pay his expenses. He purchased a second car that he later could not \nafford, which exacerbated his financial situation. Applicant hopes in the long term to sell \nthe house he inherited to resolve his delinquent debts. At this juncture, he has an \nunreliable financial track record, and he has not met his burden of persuasion. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor as an engineer \nsince September 2017. Applicant is seeking to obtain national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections \n12, 13A, and 17.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eleven past-due or charged-off student loans, \ntotaling $84,005. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. \nApplicant used a combination of student loans and credit-card debt to pay his way \nthrough school. After school Applicant went through a long period of under-employment \nand unemployment before obtaining his current position three years ago. During the past \nthree years he had been saving money to pay off his large credit-card debt, and has done \nso. This is supported by the two most recent credit reports in the record, submitted by the \nGovernment. He then continued saving money and negotiated payoffs with several of the \nstudent-loan creditors. He has substantially reduced his indebtedness, and has a plan in \nplace to resolve all of his remaining student loans in the near future.

This debt and the one in 1.f for \n$9,383 are alleged in the SOR. Two additional loans are not alleged in the SOR. The total \nbalance for all four loans was alleged to be $47,470.20. Applicant reached a payment \narrangement and provided a copy of a cashier\u2019s check for $34,396.87 that he had sent to \nthe creditor\u2019s agent as payment in full for these four loans. This debt is being resolved. \n(Tr. 53-55; Government Exhibit 2 at 6, Exhibit 3 at 3, 4; Applicant Exhibit E, Exhibit G at \n4, 5, 7, 8, 9.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing NAVIENT $11,278 for a charged-off student loan. \nThis is one of four loans Applicant had with this creditor, totaling $37,278. The other three \nare allegations 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. Applicant made a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor\u2019s agent and paid the agreed amount in February 2020. This debt has been \nresolved.

Applicant admitted owing GLEHC $6,505 for a past-due student loan. \nApplicant is currently attempting to resolve this debt and one other (1.c) with the creditor. \nThis debt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit G at 5.) \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admitted owing ECMC $3,906 for a past-due student loan. This is \none of three loans with this creditor, totaling $7,591.

Applicant admitted owing ECMC $718 for a past-due student loan. Applicant \nis currently in active negotiation with the creditor to pay this debt in full. (Applicant Exhibit \nG at 5.) \nFour credit reports were submitted by the Government (Government Exhibits 3 \nthrough 6). The credit reports show that Applicant has substantially reduced his \ndelinquent debt over the past year. Applicant stated that his current financial situation is \nstable. Applicant is able to maintain payments on all of his current debts, and resolve his \nremaining delinquent student loans in a timely fashion. (Tr. 60, 69-75.) \nApplicant submitted a letter of recommendation from the president of his employer. \nApplicant works for a small company of about 65 individuals, so he has frequent contact \nwith the president. The letter stated that Applicant, \u201cis trustworthy and industrious.\u201d (Tr. \n27-28; Applicant Exhibit A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n4 \n\n \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant owed approximately $84,000 for past-due and charged-off student loans \nas of the date the SOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those \nconcerns. \n \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable, in that he has paid off one major \ncredit card debt in full, and is making timely payments on another credit card. In addition, \nhe has been making great strides towards resolving his student-loan debt. He submitted \ndocumentary evidence showing that he had made payment arrangements concerning six \nof the loans alleged in the SOR, plus two additional loans not alleged, and had paid \napproximately $40,000 this year to resolve them. He is in active negotiations with the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nother creditors to resolve the remaining loan debts. Applicant has behaved responsibly in \nresolving these debts. \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payments of such debts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks \nomitted).  \nWhen considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view Applicant\u2019s \ncorrective action in addressing the indebtedness he incurred to further his education to \nbe responsible and reasonable. Given his resources, he has initiated a pragmatic \napproach to the repayment of his SOR debts and has taken significant steps to resolve \nthose debts. Applicant has the knowledge and ability that will allow him to stay on a proper \nfinancial footing. He has fully mitigated all the allegations in the SOR. Paragraph 1 is \nfound for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial situation. The situation regarding his student loans is \nbeing resolved in a responsible manner, and does not evince poor judgment or \nunreliability. He has minimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, as well as \nthe likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record evidence does not create substantial \ndoubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(HE 3) On November 11, 2020, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On \nNovember 16, 2020, the case was assigned to me. Processing of the case was delayed \ndue to COVID-19. On March 3, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for March 24, 2021. (HE 1) Her \nhearing was held as scheduled in the vicinity of Arlington, Virginia using the U.S. Cyber \nCommand video teleconference system.

(Tr. 20) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges and Applicant admitted that in approximately October 2010, she \nwas hospitalized for suicidal ideations, depression, anxiety, and an emotional breakdown. \nPrior to her inpatient treatment, Applicant was receiving counseling, but not medication. \n(Tr. 23) In 2010, Applicant was under stress from classes and her relationship with a \nboyfriend, and she became depressed. (Tr. 22) She had a plan to end her life, either by \njumping from a balcony or getting hit by a vehicle.

(Tr. 65) She \nreceived about one week of inpatient and one week of intensive outpatient treatment. (Tr. \n23, 65) She was diagnosed as having depression and anxiety, and she was prescribed \npsychotropic medication. (Tr. 23) She followed treatment advice; however, her medication \nwas not as effective as it should have been, and she was hospitalized in February 2011. \n(Tr. 24) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges and Applicant admitted that in approximately February 2011, \nshe was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment, a suicide attempt, suicidal ideations, \ndepression, anxiety, and medication adjustments. Applicant attempted to hang herself \nwith a scarf. (Tr. 66) She explained that the following stressors affected her mental status: \nshe graduated early from college; her relationship with her boyfriend ended; she was in \na car accident; and she needed her medications adjusted. (Tr. 24-26) She voluntarily \nsought inpatient treatment. (Tr. 25) The medication she received in 2010 caused \u201crapid \ncycling\u201d or going from depression to a kind of hypomania. (Tr. 25-26) Her medication was \nchanged to Zoloft for depression and Wellbutrin for mood stabilization. (Tr. 25-26) She \nreceived post inpatient follow-up treatment from two psychiatrists and a therapist. (Tr. 26) \nShe received multiple medication changes or adjustments. (Tr. 27) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges and Applicant admitted that in approximately November 2014, \nshe was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment, depression, anxiety, general mental \nbreakdown, and medication adjustments. She was under stress because of difficulty in \nthe completion of her thesis for her master\u2019s program. (Tr. 27) She did not have any \nfriends in graduate school, and she had suicidal ideation and engaged in self harm. (Tr. \n27) She cut herself; however, the cuts were shallow and not sufficiently harmful for her to \nseek medical attention for them. (Tr. 66-67) She also took six extra pills; however, she \ndid not seek medical attention for the overdose. (Tr. 67) In 2014, her father picked her up \nat graduate school and brought her to her home state for inpatient treatment. (Tr. 67-68) \nShe was hospitalized to monitor her reactions from medication changes and to enable \nher to receive more intensive counseling. (Tr. 28) She was prescribed Prozac, her \nWellbutrin dosage was adjusted upward, and she received Klonopin to treat her anxiety. \n(Tr. 29)    \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges and Applicant admits that she received a psychological \nevaluation from a licensed clinical psychologist, Dr. K, in December 2017. (GE 3a) Dr. K \ndiagnosed her with: Major Depressive Disorder, severe, without psychotic features; \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder; Attention-Deficit Disorder (ADD) without hyperactivity; and \nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). (GE 3a at 4) Applicant agreed with Dr. K\u2019s \ndiagnoses. (Tr. 30) She was prescribed the following medications: Adderall XR (15 mg); \nWellbutrin (200 mg); Klonopin (0.5 mg); and Prozac (40 mg). (GE 3a at 4) Dr. K \ninterviewed her for two hours, and two hours of tests were conducted. (Tr. 30) Dr. K \nrecommended that she receive psychiatric medication and medication management, and \nhe indicated she would benefit from a variety of individual therapies. (Tr. 31) Dr. K said: \nWith respect to suicidal ideation, she reports experiencing intense and \nrecurrent suicidal thoughts, hence, potential for suicide should be evaluated \nregularly by her therapist and appropriate interventions should be \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nimplemented, as needed. Data also indicates that [Applicant] may also, at \ntimes, be somewhat emotionally labile, manifesting fairly rapid and extreme \nmood swings, which may also include intense emotional (i.e. anger) \noutbursts. [She] also endorsed the following symptoms of depression on the \n[Beck's Depression Inventory]: feeling sad all the time, sense of failure, \nfeeling discouraged about the future, reduced satisfaction, feeling \ndissatisfied or bored with everything, feelings of guilt, self-hate, self-\ncriticism, loss of interest in others, trouble making decisions, reduced \ninterest in socializing, negative self-image, crying more than usual, self-\nannoyance and irritability, trouble with concentration, sleep and appetite \ndisturbances, fatigue, suicidal ideations without intent or plan, . . . and \npsychosomatic complaints. (GE 3a at 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that on May 18, 2019, the CAF sent Applicant for an evaluation \nby Dr. W, a psychologist, who considered her background information, a clinical interview, \nobservations, and psychological testing. Applicant said Dr. W interviewed her for about \nan hour, and she was tested for about an hour. (Tr. 32) Dr. W concluded that Applicant \nmet the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder recurrent, moderate; PTSD, chronic; and \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder. (GE 4 at 7) Dr. W said: \nWith respect to suicidal ideation, [Applicant] reports experiencing intense \nand recurrent suicidal thoughts at a level typical of individuals who are \nplaced on suicide precautions. Whereas she denied suicidal ideation during \nthe interview, a careful follow-up regarding the details of her suicidal \nthoughts and the potential for suicidal behavior is warranted, along with an \nevaluation of her life circumstances and available support systems as \npotential mediating factors. (GE 4 at 6) \nDr. W concluded that suicidal thoughts continue to pose a concern for Applicant, \nand that there is a risk of future mental health problems based on difficulties with anxiety, \ninsomnia, and PTSD symptoms. Dr. W concluded that Applicant was not engaged in \nenough of the right type of counseling or other medical treatment, and that her conditions \nand symptoms may impact her judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, and that her \nprognosis is guarded. (GE 4 at 7) Dr. W did not advise Applicant of the type of counseling \nor therapy that she needed. (Tr. 70) At the time of Dr. W\u2019s evaluation, Applicant was \nreceiving therapy every two weeks, and a psychiatrist managed her medications. (Tr. 33) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that from January 2016 to present Applicant received treatment \nfrom Dr. F for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent \nepisode, moderate. Applicant met with Dr. F every two or three months to ascertain the \neffectiveness of her medications, and when she became pregnant, the frequency of her \nappointments was increased to a monthly basis. (Tr. 35) Dr. F repeatedly indicated in \nApplicant\u2019s medical records \u201cNegative for agitation, behavioral problems, decreased \nconcentration, dysphoric mood, hallucinations, self-injury, sleep disturbance and suicidal \nideas.\u201d (GE 3b) In May 2020, her Zoloft dosage was reduced from 100 milligrams to 50 \nmilligrams, she stopped taking Vibryd, another antidepressant, Wellbutrin, and Klonopin \nbecause of her pregnancy. (Tr. 35-36) After her baby was born, she remained exclusively \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non Zoloft, and she has not suffered from depression. (Tr. 36) Her doctor has been \nconsidering changing her medications. (Tr. 37) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that from November 2017 to present Applicant received \ntreatment from Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) J for Major Depressive Disorder \nModerate, PTSD, and General Anxiety. Initially, she met with LPC J every week for 45 \nminutes, and then in 2018 and 2019, she met LPC J every two weeks for 45-minute \ntherapy sessions involving \u201ctalk and cognitive behavioral therapy to allow [Applicant] to \ntalk through potential stressors and provide [her] with coping mechanisms that enable \n[her] to successfully manage her mental health.\u201d (Tr. 43; SOR response at 5-6) LPC J \nalso provided dialectical behavioral therapy to Applicant. (Tr. 43) The frequency of LPC \nJ\u2019s sessions was reduced to every two weeks based on LPC J\u2019s recommendation. (Tr. \n43-44) \nOn January 31, 2020, LPC J wrote that Applicant had increased feelings of \ndepression and Dr. F increased her antidepressant dosage. (Tr. 58; AE at 62) Applicant \ntold LPC J that \u201cwork has been stressful and she had to be spoken to by her supervisor \nbecause she has made multiple mistakes. She also added that she feels unorganized.\u201d \n(Tr. 58-59; AE at 62) At the next session with LPC J on February 14, 2020, Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cmood appeared to be Anxious, Depressed and Irritable, Full range/appropriate and \nreactive and tearful.\u201d (AE at 64) LPC J wrote in Applicant\u2019s medical record that Applicant \ndisclosed that her \u201c\u2018brain shut off\u2019 and she started to self harm while at work. [Applicant] \nreported she made mistakes at work and felt disappointed and embarrassed of herself. \nTherapist helped [Applicant] explore her feelings and patient shared she self harmed to \npunish herself and to relieve her anger.\u201d (Tr. 60; AE at 64) \nAfter COVID-19 became a national problem around March 2020, Applicant\u2019s \nappointments were by telephone or video telephone and not in person with LPC J. (Tr. \n71) Her next four sessions after the February 14, 2020 session with LPC J were on March \n7, 2020; April 15, 2020; June 19, 2020; and July 1, 2020. (Tr. 60-62; AE at 66, 72, 78, 80) \nApplicant did not recall meeting with LPC J after July 1, 2020, and her medical records \ndo not reflect meeting with a therapist after July 1, 2020. (Tr. 62, 75)  \nApplicant said she reduced her sessions with LPC J because she thought some of \nLPC J\u2019s comments relating to her pregnancy and the prospective birth of her daughter \nwere inappropriate and less professional than her previous counseling sessions. (Tr. 72, \n78, 113) Applicant did not tell LPC J that she was uncomfortable because of LPC J\u2019s \ncomments. (Tr. 75) LPC J left her practice in 2020, and Applicant has been looking for a \nnew therapist since then. (Tr. 41, 45) She attempted to employ one therapist; however, \ndue to an insurance issue, it did not work out. (Tr. 76) She hopes to resume appointments \nwith a therapist in the next month after her hearing. (Tr. 42, 114) \nFrom November 2019 to December 2020, Applicant and her husband met with a \ncouple\u2019s counselor about once a month. (Tr. 73) She told the counselor about her mental-\nhealth history. (Tr. 77) She did not indicate whether the couple\u2019s counselor assessed her \nfor work-related stress, suicidal ideations, and the need for medication adjustments. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt her December 9, 2020 session with Dr. F, she informed him that she was not \nseeing a therapist, and he \u201cstrongly encouraged [her] to resume counseling/therapy.\u201d (Tr. \n63-64; AE at 91) At her February 16, 2021 session with Dr. F, he concluded Applicant \u201cis \nfeeling more anxious and somewhat low. This may very well be a result of sleep \ndeprivation. Since she is no longer nursing therefore the dose of Zoloft will be increased \nto treat the residual symptoms. . . . She was strongly encouraged to resume \ncounseling/therapy.\u201d (Tr. 64; AE at 95) At her March 2021 appointment with Dr. F, he \ngave her a list of suggested therapists to see. (Tr. 64) \nApplicant is active in her church, volunteers in youth education, and as a church \nofficer. (Tr. 54; AE at 28) She also plays an instrument on a symphony orchestra and in \na musical capacity for her church. (Tr. 54; AE at 28) \nApplicant first had suicidal ideations at age 13. (GE 4 at 2) She has been working \nwith various therapists since 2007 or 2008. (Tr. 40) Over the last 11 years, Applicant\u2019s \nmedications have been changed about 20 times. (Tr. 37) At age 23, she \u201cwas violently \nraped.\u201d (GE 4 at 3) \u201c[A]fter she was raped, she experienced flashbacks, hypervigilance, \nincreased startle, feelings of guilt, anger, shame and blame and she avoided sexual \nencounters.\u201d (Id.) Based on genetic testing about two years ago, her medications and \ndosages have been more effective because they are specifically designed for her body \nchemistry. (Tr. 37-39) She increased the frequency of her meetings with Dr. F mostly for \nmedication management. (Tr. 41-42, 51) She said she always complied with treatment \nrecommendations. (Tr. 46) Her treatment has always been voluntary. (Tr. 46) She is \nfeeling much better than she did several years ago. (Tr. 47) She has not had a panic \nattack since 2019. (Tr. 47) The most stressful part of Applicant\u2019s life was her work \nenvironment. (Tr. 73-74) She worked in a large room with about 50 employees in the \nsame room, and they worked from their cubicles. (Tr. 74) Circumstances beyond her \ncontrol adversely affected her productivity, and supervisors became upset. (Tr. 74) She \nbelieved that she could return to her work environment after the pandemic, and she could \nhandle the stress and her anxiety. (Tr. 75) \nApplicant said she has been doing better for the last 18 months. (Tr. 55) She \nbelieved her prognosis was good so long as she keeps going to therapy and complies \nwith medication recommendations. (Tr. 47) Her stress level is lower; she is happily \nmarried; she has a baby; and she has the support of her family and church. (Tr. 48, 50) \nIf she felt stress from work, she planned to talk to her therapist and family and take actions \nto manage the stress. (Tr. 48-49) Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she is able to work at \nhome \u201ca lot better,\u201d and the stress from work is less. (Tr. 69) Her family support network \nis closer now than it was in 2014 when she sought her most recent inpatient treatment. \n(Tr. 49) Dr. F, Applicant\u2019s husband, and her parents monitored her for signs of depression \nduring her pregnancy and after the birth of her baby.

(Tr. 104) Applicant\u2019s husband said: \n[Applicant] has never been a rule breaker and is not the type of person to \n[be] disrespect[ful to] authority. If she were to be put in a position of trust \nwith the U.S. Government, I have no doubt that she would be a valuable \nasset in protecting our national secrets. She is very reliable and certainly \nwould not be considered dysfunctional. She has a strong moral character \nand always wants to do the right thing. . . . I would not hesitate to trust [her] \nwith company-confidential information, and in the event that she is granted \na clearance, any classified information in which she has a need to know. \n(AE at 8) \nApplicant\u2019s mother and spouse described her as trustworthy, reliable, and \nintelligent, honest, and as having good judgment. (Tr. 97, 101, 116-119; AE at 37-39) She \nreceives support from her family, friends, and psychiatrist. (Tr. 119) Her mother and \nspouse recommended that Applicant receive access to classified information. (Tr. 101, \n118-120) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nPsychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 articulates the security concern for psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nApplicant received inpatient mental-health treatment three times. Dr. W concluded \nthat Applicant\u2019s psychological conditions and symptoms may impact her judgment, \nreliability or trustworthiness, and that her prognosis is guarded. She attempted suicide on \none occasion, and she engaged in self harm on several occasions. The record \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), and 28(c). Further details will be discussed in the \nmitigation analysis, infra. \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant presented some important mitigating evidence. She said she has been \ndoing better for the last 18 months. Her stress level is lower; she is happily married; she \nhas a baby; and she has the support of her family and church. If she felt stress from work, \nshe would talk to her therapist and family and take action to manage the stress. Due to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, she is able to work at home \u201ca lot better,\u201d and the stress from \nwork is less. Her family support network is closer now than it was in 2014 when she had \nher most recent inpatient mental-health treatment. Dr. F, Applicant\u2019s husband, and her \nparents have monitored her for signs of depression during her pregnancy and after the \nbirth of her baby. \nThere is evidence of one non-SOR allegation: Applicant failed to comply with Dr. \nF\u2019s treatment recommendation, that is, she continue to receive counseling or therapy. In \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. \n \nBd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). This non-SOR allegation will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. Applicant was \nhospitalized for inpatient mental-health treatment in 2010, 2011, and 2014. Dr. W \nconcluded that Applicant was not receiving an appropriate form of therapy nor with \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsufficient frequency. Her conditions and symptoms may impact her judgment, reliability \nor trustworthiness; and her prognosis is guarded. She attempted suicide on one occasion \nwhen she tried to hang herself with a scarf while she was living at home. Her death was \nprevented when the pole that held the scarf broke, and her parents found her. She \nengaged in self harm on several occasions. At her December 9, 2020 session with Dr. F, \nshe informed him that she was not seeing a therapist, and he \u201cstrongly encouraged [her] \nto resume counseling/therapy.\u201d (AE at 91) She has not seen a therapist for mental-health \ncounseling since July 2020. Frequent therapist meetings are an important check on her \nlevel of depression, and suicidal ideations, and they reduce the possibility of suicide. Dr. \nF did not provide a prognosis indicating that she was stable and unlikely to attempt suicide \nin the future. Dr. F did not provide a recommendation that she have access to classified \ninformation. Under a totality of the circumstances, there is insufficient evidence to support \nmitigation of psychological conditions security concerns at this time. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the whole-person concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the \ntotality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other variables. \nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the determination of whether to grant a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my \nwhole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under that \nguideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old technical report writer who has been employed by a \ngovernment contractor since 2017. She has also been assigned duties in program \nmanagement, planning operations, and purchasing. In 2016, she married, and in \nFebruary 2021, her daughter was born. \nApplicant is a dedicated employee, community member, spouse, and friend. She \nis active in her community, church, and symphony orchestra. Her supervisor at work, a \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nfriend from church and colleague at work, her spouse, and her mother described \nApplicant as honest, reliable, and trustworthy. Their statements support approval of \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information.   \nAs indicated in the psychological conditions section, Applicant has a lengthy \nhistory of mental-health issues. Her suicidal ideation, attempted suicide, and incidents of \nself harm are concerning. The Department of Defense encourages employees to seek \nneeded mental-health therapy and treatment, and AG \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g do not raise a \nsecurity concern. She sought and received inpatient mental-health treatment in 2010, \n2011, and 2014, and her continued participation in mental-health counseling and \ntreatments are mitigating; however, the underlying reasons she sought treatment, severe \ndepression and self-injury, remain a security concern. Since July 2020, she has not been \nreceiving recommended therapy. Stress is likely to increase when she returns to the \nworkplace. The lack of ongoing therapy sessions to assess her mental status results in \nlingering security concerns. The record established that Applicant is an intelligent, caring, \ndedicated, and diligent employee who will be an important asset to DOD upon full \nmitigation of security concerns. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context \nof the whole person. Psychological conditions security concerns are not mitigated at this \ntime. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance at this time. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

The \nDOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive) and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June \n8, 2017. \nOn December 12, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations and \nrequesting a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on June 2, 2021. On July \n23, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, \nscheduling Applicant\u2019s case for August 10, 2021.

I considered Applicant\u2019s testimony. I also incorporated a copy of \nthe discovery letter that Department Counsel mailed to Applicant (Hearing Exhibit I). The \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on August 19, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old single man. He graduated from college in 2015 with a \ndegree in software engineering. (Ex. 1 at 14) He has been working for his current employer \nsince May 2018 as an assurance engineer. (GE 1 at 16) His duties include quality control. \n(Tr. 89) \nApplicant began working as a software tester for his previous employer in 2015. It \nwas the first full-time job that he worked after finishing college. (Tr. 69). He was fired in \nFebruary 2018 for violating company standards of conduct after altering test-result data. \n(Answer at 1) Applicant admits that he was fired for altering data; however, he denies that \nhe did so with any fraudulent intent. \nApplicant\u2019s job was to run software to ascertain whether it \u201cbehaved\u201d as designed. \n(Tr. 24) Applicant worked among a group of first-line engineers who ran the new software \nwith the hardware. He did so by creating source code that bridged software to hardware. If \nthe hardware then performed as instructed by the software, the software was considered to \nhave passed, and was moved to the test leader for additional validation. If it passed this \nsecond level of testing, it was submitted to the customer. (Tr. 34-35) \nApplicant performed hundreds of software tests during his stint with his previous \nemployer. On six or seven out of approximately 200 tests, the test reports indicated that the \nsoftware failed. (Tr. 21, 37) When Applicant reviewed the test reports that indicated the \nsoftware failed, and re-tested the software, he discovered that the software was not the \nproblem. Rather, the failures were false negatives, caused either because of spelling errors \nhe made when writing the source code that bridged the software to the hardware or \nbecause there was a timing glitch in the hardware that caused it to misread the software. \n(Tr. 30\u201331, 38) \nConvinced that test failures sometimes were caused by spelling errors or timing \nglitches and not by software problems, Applicant began changing failures to passes \nwhenever he thought these issues presented themselves. (Tr. 28) He did not do these to \ncover up any mistake that he may have made, or because of any deadline pressure or \nperformance incentives. (Tr. 28) Instead, he thought that if he was wrong and the problem, \nin fact, related to software design, it would be caught at the next level review, and returned \nto him, whereupon, he could rework the testing code. (Tr. 29) In sum, he contends that he \ndid not intentionally violate company policy because he mistakenly believed his actions \nwere \u201cwithin the bounds of testing, and that it\u2019s something that [he] could just rework and \nrecover.\u201d (Tr. 40; GE 2 at 6) \n2 \n\n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer began to notice that some of Applicant\u2019s software that he \nreported as passing the tests, actually were not working when tested at the next level. (Tr. \n46) This prompted an investigation. When confronted, Applicant admitted that he altered \nthe test results, prompting his employer to terminate him. In doing so, Applicant\u2019s employer \nconcluded that he \u201cfraudulently altered documentation in violation of the Company\u2019s \nstandards of conduct,\u201d by \u201cmanipulating several test files to indicate a passing result when \nin fact the test run had resulted in failure.\u201d (GE 3) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn retrospect, Applicant recognizes that his actions were wrong, testifying that \u201cthe \nblame lies with [him]\u201d for assuming what the problem was, without consulting with his team \nmembers. (Tr. 55, 57) Moreover, he testified that such failure \u201cundermines the software \ndevelopment cycle,\u201d and could have jeopardized his employer\u2019s relationship with the \ncustomer, in that the customer could have discovered the problem during a program audit, \nwhich it had the right to conduct at any time. (Tr. 59, 73) When Applicant\u2019s current \nemployer hired him, he was forthcoming about the circumstances that led to the \ntermination from his previous job. (Answer at 2) \nApplicant has been working with his current employer in their software quality \nassurance division since 2018. (Tr. 89) His duties include formal test witnessing, code/test \nprocedure reviews, and media verifications. (AE A) Per his supervisor, who has overseen \nhis work for the past two years, Applicant has proven \u201cto be a great hire and a key addition \nto the team, [and] has received several recognition awards from his peers.\u201d (AE A) Per \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor who supervised him during the first two years of his tenure with his \ncurrent employer, Applicant was well-respected by the company\u2019s stakeholder, and was \ndoing a good job with the \u201cessential \u2018block and tackle\u2019 skills that keep system engineers out \nof trouble.\u201d (Answer at 4) Applicant\u2019s first supervisor at the current job also complemented \nhim for scheduling meetings to ensure that team members \u201care on the same page.\u201d \n(Answer at 7) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance,\nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying c onditions and mitigating c onditions, which are required to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1 \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, conduct that may not be sufficient alone for an adverse \ndetermination may be disqualifying if it generates whole-person concerns of \nuntrustworthiness, questionable judgment, and unwillingness to comply with rules and \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; ( 4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at t he time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, ex\n \nploitation, or \n \n duress; and \n \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. \n \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregulations. (AG \u00b6 16) Specifically, Applicant\u2019s conduct triggers the application of the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 16(d)(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior . . .; \nAG \u00b6 16(d)(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \nAG \u00b6 16(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment. \nThere is no record evidence that Applicant was under any deadline to complete his \nwork, or received any incentives based on the number of passing software tests. Moreover, \nhe was not responsible for software design, and faced no consequences if the software \napplications failed. Consequently, I conclude that Applicant did not intend to mislead his \nemployer when he altered the test results. \nApplicant tested a theory about why the software test results were sometimes \ninaccurate without conferring with his supervisor or co-workers, reasoning that if he was \nwrong, the second-level testing would catch any software design problems. In doing so, \nApplicant bypassed the established testing system of the employer, and increased the \npossibility that software with design defects could escape detection and be provided to the \ncustomer. Consequently, the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s transgression remains \nsignificant, regardless of whether he intended to mislead his employer. \nThe job in which the misconduct occurred was the first full-time job that Applicant \nheld after finishing college. Nearly four years have passed since Applicant last altered a \ntest result. Applicant\u2019s current job, like his previous job, involves quality assurance of \nsoftware production and testing procedure reviews. He has been doing a good job, as \nreflected by the strong reference letters from his current supervisor and his performance \nreviews. In addition, recognizing that his poor decision-making at his previous job was \ncaused, in part, by his failure to consult with team members, he now schedules meetings \nregularly with team members to ensure everyone is on the same page. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to \nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s transgression was significant. However, it \nis outweighed when viewed in the context of Applicant\u2019s inexperience when the lapse in \njudgment occurred, his contrition, the length of time that has elapsed since the misconduct, \nand the strong presence of rehabilitation, as demonstrated by his current job performance. \nI conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concern. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid taxes and \ndelinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment, and separation from his wife before they reconciled. Unemployment \nand underemployment would normally be considered as beyond one\u2019s control, but not \nwhen it resulted from a positive drug test. \nApplicant has been paying his debts for several years. He satisfied a $5,782 \njudgment in December 2018. He satisfied a $7,650 judgment in about May 2020. The \njudgment was apparently paid by garnishment. He has been paying the IRS since \nMarch 2018, and his state taxes are paid. He paid other debts, including debts that were \nnot alleged in the SOR, and he is paying debts through a DMP. \n  \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \nApplicant has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. His finances no longer generate questions about his \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSecurity concerns about his finances are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a\nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct\nincludes: \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s  \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use in 2014 reflects questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. The conduct also created \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are \napplicable. \nApplicant did not report his 2014 marijuana use on his 2018 SF 86. I considered \nall the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s explanation that he thought he reported the \nmarijuana use. He stated that he completed the SF 86 on the computer, and it was \nkicked back about three times, and he did not notice that it was missing the information \nabout his marijuana use. He reported on the SF 86 that he was \u201c[t]erminated after \nreturning from long term disability,\u201d but he did not state that he was terminated after a \npositive drug test. When assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, I considered two statements \nmade during his background interview that are implausible. He stated that he had a \n.09% BAC after drinking only one beer several hours before he was stopped by the \npolice, and he reported that he tested positive when he returned to work in mid-2014 \nafter using marijuana one time in January 2014. I find by substantial evidence2 that he \n2 Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nintentionally provided false information about his marijuana use on the 2018 SF 86. AG \n\u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant denied that he lied on the SF 86. Having determined that he \nintentionally omitted information about his marijuana use in an attempt to mislead the \ngovernment, I have also determined that his explanations that the omissions were \nunintentional were also false. It would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.3 \n17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd.

That conduct would normally be \nmitigated. However, I cannot trust that Applicant told the truth about his marijuana use. \nWithout complete candor, there are no applicable mitigating conditions to that conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable employment record at his current job. However, that is insufficient \nto overcome his lack of honesty. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns, but he did not mitigate the \npersonal conduct security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 5, 2017, and \na second SCA on June 6, 2017. On September 25, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guidelines B and C. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 31, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 8, 2020, and \nthe case was assigned to me on June 23, 2020. On June 24, 2020, the Defense Office of \n1 \n\n \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for July \n29, 2020. On July 1, 2020, the hearing was cancelled because Applicant was quarantined \noverseas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 3, 2021, DOHA notified Applicant \nthat the hearing was rescheduled for March 16, 2021. I convened the hearing as \nrescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) F through R, which \nwere admitted without objection. AX A through E had been previously submitted with \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and were admitted without objection at the hearing. I kept \nthe record open until April 16, 2021, to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary \nevidence. He timely submitted AX R through CC, which were admitted without objection. \nI marked his supplemental AX R as AX DD to avoid having two exhibits labeled AX R. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 31, 2021. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAmendment of SOR \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add SOR \u00b6 1.j, \nalleging that Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Iraq and a resident of Jordan. I granted the \nmotion to amend the SOR, with no objection by Applicant. \nAdministrative Notice \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of \nrelevant facts about Iraq, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Hearing Exhibits \n(HX) I, II, and III). After the hearing, Department Counsel submitted additional official \ndocuments supporting the requests for administrative notice (HX IV, V, and VI). I took \nadministrative notice as requested by Department Counsel. I have also taken \nadministrative notice of Executive Order (EO) 13769 dated January 27, 2017; EO Order \n13780 dated March 6, 2017; and the National Security Memorandum, Memorandum on \nRevitalizing America\u2019s Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and \nPartnerships, dated February 4, 2021, submitted by Applicant as AX AA, BB, and CC. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6 1.c in part, admitted SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f, admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i in part, admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a with an explanation, \nand denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g.

The company was \nnot profitable, and he left it in April 2017 and began working for his current employer. (GX \n2 at 14-15.) Since May 2017, he has been employed by a defense contractor as a linguist \nin support of a U.S. Marine Corps team in Jordan.

He gave his interest in the apartment to his daughter, \nwho is now the sole owner. She is now living in the United States. (GX 3.) His daughter \nhas no plans to return to Jordan. She intends to stay in the United States, graduate from \ncollege, and attend medical school. (Tr. 55.) \nApplicant and his aunt jointly own a home in the United States. They received the \nhome as a gift from Applicant\u2019s father in June 2015. In his SCA, Applicant listed the home \nas his permanent residence since March 2017. His aunt and his daughter currently live in \nhis U.S. home. (Tr. 47-48; AX L.) \nWhile Applicant previously resided in Jordan, he employed a live-in housekeeper \nwho was a citizen of Indonesia with a work permit in Jordan. He hired his housekeeper \nthrough a local agency. She stopped working for Applicant about a year ago. (Tr. 20) \nAlthough Applicant has returned to Jordan, he does not employ a housekeeper. \nApplicant was born in Iraq, but he is a U.S. citizen by birth. (AX P.) His mother is \na native-born citizen of the United States and is a dual citizen of the United States and \nthe United Kingdom. His mother resides in the United States but spends summers in the \nUnited Kingdom. (GX 8 at 11.) Applicant acquired Iraqi citizenship by virtue of his birth in \nIraq and the Iraqi citizenship of his father. His father was born in Iraq and is now a citizen \nof the United Kingdom. His parents met while his father was attending a university in the \nUnited States. After they married in July 1961, they lived in Iraq, where Applicant\u2019s father \nand grandfather owned and operated an aluminum factory, and Applicant\u2019s mother \nworked for the American Embassy in Bagdad. His parents then moved to the United \nKingdom, where Applicant attended a boarding school and high school. Applicant \nattended some college in the United States but completed his college education in the \nUnited Kingdom. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree from American International University, \nlocated in the United Kingdom, in July 1989. He was a dual citizen of the United States \nand Iraq until he renounced his Iraqi citizenship in July 1997. (GX 8 at 10.) \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a dual citizen of the United States and the United Kingdom. \nHe lives and works in the United States. Applicant\u2019s sister is a dual citizen and resident \nof the United States and the United Kingdom. She lives and works in the United Kingdom. \n(GX 2 at 23-26.) \nAfter graduating from college, Applicant worked for his father in a construction and \nland-development business. At some time in 1997, he returned to Iraq to work for his \nfather. While in Iraq, he met his first wife, a citizen and resident of Iraq. They married in \nNovember 1997 in Iraq. Their only child was born in April 2001. Applicant\u2019s wife was \nemployed by the United Nations and was assigned to work in Jordan in 2003. (GX 6 at \n5.) Applicant remained in Iraq, working as a liaison officer and coordinator for the United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID), until he moved to Jordan in 2004, \nwhen his wife became ill. (Answer to SOR at 6.) His wife passed away in June 2005. (AX \nR.) He has not been in Iraq since 2010.

(Tr. 22.) However, when \nhe updated his personal information with his employer in February 2019, he informed his \nsupervisor that he married in December 2018, not 2019. He also reported that his wife \nholds a bachelor\u2019s degree in microbiology, and a master\u2019s degree in business \nadministration, and that she was working at the United Nations Educational, Scientific, \nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Amman, Jordan. (AX V.) Applicant and his wife \ncurrently live in his daughter\u2019s apartment in Jordan. (Tr. 41.) \nApplicant sponsored his wife for a spouse\u2019s green card. (Tr. 38.) She submitted \nher application in July 2019. Her application reflects that she is 32 years old; that she is \na native of Iraq; that her city and country of last residence is Amman, Jordan; that her \noccupation is business, management, and marketing; and her address in the United \nStates is Applicant\u2019s home in the United States. (AX T.) She received her spouse visa in \nOctober 2019. (AX DD at 1.) She has a permanent resident card reflecting her residence \nin the United States since November 2019. (AX DD at 2.) She also holds a U.S. Social \nSecurity Card. (AX S.) Applicant testified that his wife has applied for U.S. citizenship, but \nhe submitted no documentation reflecting a citizenship application. (Tr. 76-77.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife had been employed by UNESCO as a human resources specialist \nfor six or seven years when they met, but she is no longer employed outside the home. \n(Tr. 37-38.) They knew each other for about a year before they married. (Tr. 36.) Before \nApplicant\u2019s wife moved to Jordan, she lived in the UAE and was involved in a real estate \nbusiness. \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s father is deceased. Her mother was a teacher in a private school \nin Iraq and is now retired. Her uncle is a shopkeeper in Iraq. The record does not reflect \nwhether she has siblings. (Tr. 38-39.) \nApplicant\u2019s father owns a one-fourth share of an aluminum factory in Iraq. It was \nworth about $6 million many years ago but it has been vacant for about 20 years, is \ndilapidated, and is now worth about $2 million. (Tr. 26; AX W.) His father also owns a \none-thirteenth share of an apartment building in Iraq. Applicant estimates that the \napartment building is worth about $700,000, (Tr. 28.) Applicant has a potential inheritance \nfrom his father that he would share with his brother, sister, and mother. \nApplicant\u2019s 20-year-old daughter was born in Jordan. She is a U.S. citizen by virtue \nof Applicant\u2019s U.S. citizenship and has resided in the United States for about three years. \n(Tr. 18.). She completed high school in Jordan and is currently attending college in the \nUnited States. (GX 8 at 12; AX F.) Applicant\u2019s brother was born in the United Kingdom \nand is a citizen and resident of the United States. (AX G.) His sister was born in Iraq, is a \ndual citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States, and resides in the United \nKingdom. (AX M.) \nApplicant testified that he does not consider his first wife\u2019s parents or siblings as \nin-laws, because she passed away in June 2005, more than 15 years ago. (Tr. 24.)

(GX 7 at 1; GX 8 at 13.) Applicant\u2019s last contact with his former mother-in-law was \nthree or four years ago. (Tr. 22.) \nApplicant\u2019s former father-in-law was a citizen and resident of Iraq who worked as \na lawyer for the Iraq Ministry of Oil, the Iraq Ministry of Health, and for the Kurdish \ngovernment in Iraq until he retired about 15 years ago. (GX 7 at 1; GX 8 at 13.) He is \ndeceased. (Tr. 21.) \nApplicant\u2019s former brother-in-law and two sisters-in-law are citizens of Iraq residing \nin the UAE. (The SOR alleges only one sister but does not identify which one.) His former \nbrother-in-law is a chemical engineer employed by a utility company. (GX 6 at 4.) One of \nhis former sisters-in-law is a dentist in the UAE. Applicant believes that she is a citizen of \nCanada. (GX 8 at 18.) The other former sister-in-law works for a U.S.-based federal \ncontractor. (GX 6 at 4; GX 7 at 1; GX 8 at 18.) Applicant\u2019s last contact with his former \nbrother-in-law and sisters-in-law was three or four years ago. (Tr. 22.) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he had a bank account in Jordan worth about \n$10,000. He closed the account about two years ago. (Tr. 25; AX K.) He has two bank \naccounts in the United States totaling about $128,000 and a retirement account worth \nabout $4,000. (Tr. 52-53; AX X.) \nWhen Applicant began working in Jordan for his current employer, he obtained a \nJordanian residence card so that he would not overstay his visa. It expired in November \n2019. (AX I.) He now has a Jordanian work visa. (Tr. 28-29.) He also obtained a Jordanian \ndriver\u2019s license, which he has retained so that he can legally drive in Jordan. He will \nsurrender his residence card when he stops working in Jordan. (Tr. 29.) \nAdministrative Notice\u2014Iraq \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The 2014 parliamentary elections \ngenerally met international standards for free and fair elections. Iraq\u2019s security forces \ninclude the regular armed forces and domestic law enforcement agencies; the Popular \nMobilization Forces (PMF), a state-sponsored military organization composed of nearly \n60 predominantly Shia components; and the Peshmerga, the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional \nGovernment\u2019s principal military force. Civilian authorities are not always able to maintain \neffective control of all security forces. \nThe United States is committed to building a strategic partnership with Iraq. Iraq is \na key partner for the United States in the region and a voice of moderation and democracy \nin the Middle East. It has a functioning government, is playing a constructive role in the \nregion, and has a bright economic future. The United States maintains vigorous and broad \nengagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, and security issues. None of the \nadministrative notice documents indicate that government of Iraq targets the United \nStates for economic or military intelligence, although it is likely that various terrorist and \ninsurgent groups seek military intelligence regarding U.S. military units operating in Iraq. \n5 \n\n \n \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS and anti-\nU.S. sectarian militias. The U.S. government considers the potential security threats to \nU.S. personnel sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security \nconditions. The U.S. Department of States warns U.S. citizens against all travel to Iraq \nbecause it is extremely dangerous. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has substantiated reports of human rights abuses \nin Iraq, including a climate of violence; misappropriation of authority by sectarian, criminal, \nand insurgent groups; arbitrary killings; torture; and other cruel, inhuman or degrading \ntreatment or punishment. The Iraqi government\u2019s effectiveness in adhering to the rule of \nlaw is hampered by ongoing violence, corruption, sectarian bias, and lack of oversight \nand accountability. Treatment of detainees has been generally poor. The judiciary is \nweak, and judicial independence is impaired by threats and killings by insurgent, \nsectarian, tribal, and criminal elements. Impunity is widespread. Security threats hinder \ncivilians\u2019 access to the courts, and witness intimidation is common. \nThe Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of \n2015 amended the existing Visa Waiver Program, which permitted citizens of certain \ncountries to travel to the United States for business or tourism for up to 90 days without \na visa. (Public Law 114-113, attached as Item X in HX I.) The amendment made citizens \nof Iraq ineligible to travel to or be admitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver \nProgram. \nEO 13769, issued on January 27, 2017, directed a comprehensive review of the \nprocess of issuing entry visas, suspended entry into the United States by aliens of certain \ncountries, including Iraq, for 90 days, suspended refugee visas for 120 days, and directed \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to compile \na list of countries for inclusion in a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit entry into \nthe United States by aliens from those countries. \nEO 13780, issued on March 6, 2017, revoked EO 13769 and reviewed the \ninformation about seven countries whose nationals were previously identified as \npresenting heightened risks to the security of the United States: Iran, Libya, Somalia, \nSudan, Syria, Yemen, and Iran. EO 13769 recognized that Iraq presented a special case \nthat justified different treatment, based on the close cooperative relationship between the \nUnited States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States \ndiplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and \nIraq\u2019s commitment to combat ISS. EO 13769 requires additional inquiries for an \napplication by any Iraqi for a visa, including consultation with a designee of the Secretary \nof Defense and use of additional information about Iraq that has been obtained since the \nissuance of EO 13769. The additional inquiry must include whether an application has \nconnections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations and individuals coming from \nterritories controlled or formerly controlled by ISIS as well as any other information \nbearing on whether the applicant may be a threat to commit acts of terrorism or otherwise \nthreaten the national security or public safety of the United States. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdministrative Notice\u2014Jordan \nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) is a constitutional monarchy ruled by \nKing Abdullah II bin Hussein. In 2013 and 2014, the United States provided Jordan $2.25 \nbillion in loan guarantees, allowing Jordan access to affordable financing from \ninternational capital markets. The U.S.-Jordan free trade agreement (FTA), the United \nStates\u2019 first FTA with an Arab country, has expanded the trade relationship by reducing \nbarriers for services, providing cutting-edge protection for intellectual property, ensuring \nregulatory transparency, and requiring effective labor and environmental enforcement. \nThe United States and Jordan have an \u201copen skies\u201d civil aviation agreement; a bilateral \ninvestment treaty; a science and technology cooperation agreement; and a memorandum \nof understanding on nuclear energy cooperation. Such agreements bolster efforts to help \ndiversify Jordan\u2019s economy and promote growth. Jordan and the United States belong to \na number of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, \nInternational Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization. Jordan also is \na Partner for Cooperation with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. \nThe United States deeply values its long history of cooperation and friendship with \nJordan, with which it established diplomatic relations in 1949. The United States \nappreciates the leadership role that Jordan plays in advancing peace and moderation in \nthe region. The United States and Jordan share the mutual goals of a comprehensive, \njust, and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and an end to violent \nextremism that threatens the security of Jordan, the region, and the entire globe. The \npeace process and Jordan\u2019s opposition to terrorism parallel and assist wider U.S. \ninterests. U.S. policy seeks to reinforce Jordan\u2019s commitment to peace, stability, and \nmoderation. In light of ongoing regional unrest, as well as global disruptions stemming \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has helped Jordan maintain its stability \nand prosperity through economic and military assistance and through close political \ncooperation. \nThe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Jordan is Level 2 (\u201cExercise \nIncreased Caution due to Terrorism). The capital of Amman is currently assessed as \nbeing at considerable risk from terrorism. Transnational and indigenous terrorist groups \nin Jordan have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks. Violent \nextremist groups in Syria and Iraq have conducted attacks in Jordan and continue to plot \nagainst local security forces, U.S. and Western interests, and soft targets such as high-\nprofile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, schools, and malls. Jordan\u2019s \nprominent role in the effort to defeat ISIS, and its shared borders with Iraq and Syria, \nincrease the potential for future terrorist incidents. \nAdministrative Notice\u2014United Arab Emirates (UAE) \nThe UAE is a federation of monarchies consisting of seven emirates. The rulers of \nthe emirates constitute the Federal Supreme Council, the country\u2019s highest legislative and \nexecutive body. The emirates are under patriarchal rule with political allegiance defined \nby loyalty to tribal leaders, leaders of individual emirates, and leaders of the federation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe United States has had friendly relations with the UAE since its formation in 1971. The \nUAE has an influential role in the Middle East and is a key partner for the United States. \nThe two countries enjoy strong bilateral cooperation on many issues, including defense. \nUAE ports host more U.S. Navy ships than anywhere else outside the United States. \nThe UAE is a regional and global financial and transportation hub, and terrorist \norganizations exploit it send and receive financial support. It is a drug-transshipment point \nfor illegal traffickers and its position as a major financial center makes it vulnerable to \nmoney laundering. There have been numerous instances in which U.S. dual-use and \nmilitary components have been shipped to Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan through the UAE, \nusing methods making it appear that UAE was the final destination. \nThe U.S. Department of State regards two emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, as \nmedium-threat locations for terrorist activity directed at or affecting U.S. Government \ninterests. The UAE\u2019s participation in the anti-ISIS coalition and the Yemen civil war has \nincreased the likelihood of terrorist attacks against Western interests. \nThe UAE vigorously monitors suspected terrorists, prosecutes individuals for \nterrorism-related offenses, collaborates with U.S. law enforcement on counterterrorism \ncases, and has foiled terrorist attacks within its borders. \nThe UAE maintains effective control over its security forces. The most significant \nhuman-rights issues have involved allegations of torture in detention, arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, government interference with privacy rights, restrictions on assembly and \nassociation, and the inability of citizens to choose their government in free and fair \nelections. \nAdministrative Notice, Presidential Memorandum \nThe Presidential Memorandum outlines the President\u2019s commitment to revitalizing \nour national security and foreign policy workforce and institutions and renewal of the \ncommitment of our institutions to the American public. It creates an Interagency Working \nGroup on the National Security Workforce, chaired by the Principal Deputy National \nSecurity Advisor. It requires a survey of all hiring authorities that exist to recruit individuals \nwith critical skills, including critical language skills and regional expertise, and seeks \nrecommendations for legislative or executive action to enhance recruitment of experts. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n\u00ad\n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s daughter is a resident of Jordan (SOR \u00b6 1.a); \nthat his live-in housekeeper is a resident of Jordan (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that his father-in-law is a \ncitizen and resident of Iraq, was an attorney for the Iraqi government, and continues to \nprovide legal advice for the government of Kurdistan (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that his mother-in-law \nis a citizen and resident of Iraq (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that his brother-in-law and sister-in-law are \ncitizens of Iraq and residents of the UAE (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e); that his sister-in-law is a resident \nof the UAE (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and that he will inherit his father\u2019s factory in Iraq worth about \n$16,000,000 and his father\u2019s apartment building in Iraq worth about $1,000,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h and 1.1).  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f both allege that Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a resident of the \nUAE. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one \nof the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. \n03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). However, in this case, \nthe evidence shows that Applicant has two former sisters-in-law who reside in the UAE. \nThus, I conclude that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are ambiguous and lack the specificity required \nby Directive \u00b6 E3.1.3, but they are not duplicative. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \n10 \n\n \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. \n02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant\u2019s former brother-\nin-law and both former sisters-in law are citizens and residents of the UAE. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.g is not established. Applicant closed his bank account \nin Jordan when he learned that it raised security concerns. \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are established, except for the values of the \ntwo properties, which appear to be much less than alleged. His father\u2019s one-fourth share \nof the abandoned factory is worth about $500,000. Assuming that Applicant, his mother, \nand his siblings inherited equal amounts, Applicant would inherit about $125,000. His \nfather\u2019s one-thirteenth share of the apartment building is worth about $53,846, and his \ninheritance, assuming equal distribution, would be about $13,461. \nThe evidence supports SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f, 1.h, and 1.i, and it is sufficient to establish \nthe disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's \nspouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002); see also ISCR Case No. \n09-06457 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011). However, that presumption does not extend to the \nimmediate family members of a former spouse. Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing made \nit clear that he does not consider his former wife\u2019s siblings as in-laws, and he has not had \ncontact with them for several years. The administrative notice documents do not indicate \nthat the governments of Iraq and Jordan target the United States for military or economic \nintelligence. However, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s Iraqi citizenship and their current residence in \nJordan made them vulnerable to terrorists. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant renounced his Iraqi citizenship in 1997. He has \nnot been in Iraq since 2010. His home is in the United States. All his financial assets are \nin the United States. He was educated in the United Kingdom and the United States. His \nmother, brother, and daughter are citizens and residents of the United States. His father \nand sister are citizens of the United Kingdom, a staunch ally of the United States. His wife \nhas survived the intense scrutiny required by EO 13780 and has been granted \npermanent-resident status in the United States. His sense of obligation to his former in-\nlaws residing in Iraq and the UAE has waned substantially during the 15 years after his \nfirst wife\u2019s death. He is proud of his ongoing relationship with the U.S. Marines stationed \nin Jordan. The Marine Corps officer who commands the Marines in Jordan holds him in \nhigh regard. I am satisfied that Applicant\u2019s deep and long-standing relationships and \nloyalties in the United States will cause him to resolve any conflicts of interest in favor of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is established. Applicant\u2019s testimony made it clear that he feels little \nobligation to or affection for his former in-laws, and he has not had contact with them for \nseveral years. \nAG \u00b6 8(d) is not established. The value of the property owned by Applicant\u2019s father \nis substantial. However, the Appeal Board has recognized the uncertainties surrounding \nthe expectancy of an inheritance and has held that an applicant does not have a financial \nstake in a country merely because he or she may inherit real or personal property in that \ncountry at some time in the future from his or her parents. ISCR Case No 97-0403 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 13, 1998). \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has issued a Jordanian residence card and driver\u2019s \nlicense.

Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact \nthat a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying \nwithout an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. \nThe same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or privilege of \nforeign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a \nforeign citizenship. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 10(a): applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \nand \nAG \u00b6 10(b): failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an \nappropriate security official, the possession of a passport or identity card \nissued by any country other than the United States. \n \nAG \u00b6 10(a) is established because Applicant acquired Iraqi citizenship based on \nhis father\u2019s citizenship. AG 10(b) is not established, because there is no evidence that \nApplicant was required to report his possession of a Jordanian identity card and driver\u2019s \nlicense and no evidence that he attempted to conceal them. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 11(b): dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference; \nAG \u00b6 11(c): the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign \ncitizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security interests; and \nAG \u00b6 11(e): the exercise of the entitlements or benefits of foreign citizenship do \nnot present a national security concern. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and 11(c) are established. Applicant\u2019s Iraqi citizenship was based \nsolely on his father\u2019s citizenship, and he renounced his Iraqi citizenship in 1997. \nAG \u00b6 11(e) is established. Arguably, Applicant\u2019s prior possession of a Jordanian \nresidence card was an \u201cidentity card.\u201d However, it has expired and Applicant has not \nrenewed it. His work visa, required by his employer, and driver\u2019s license issued by the \nJordanian government do not conflict with U.S. national security interests. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and C in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and C, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nunder Guidelines B and C. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The \ncase was assigned to me on March 2, 2021. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 31, 2021, and the hearing was held as \nscheduled on April 22, 2021. This hearing was convened as scheduled using the Defense \nCollaboration Services (DCS) video teleconferencing capabilities. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence without objection. \nThe Government\u2019s pre-hearing discovery letter and exhibit list were marked as hearing \nexhibits (HE) I and II. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A-C, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 3, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations. His admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 25 years old. He worked for a defense contractor (DC) at various times \nfrom March 2018 to March 2020, either in an internship program or a cooperative \nprogram. He holds an associate\u2019s degree and is working toward his bachelor\u2019s degree. \nHe is single, never married, and has no children. (Tr. 6, 23-28; GE1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana at various times from October 2018 to \nAugust 2019; that he used marijuana after being granted an interim security clearance in \nJune 2018; and in response to interrogatories, in August 2019, he admitted that he \nintended to use marijuana in the future. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) It also alleged that Applicant \nconsumed alcohol to the point of intoxication twice per month; and that he was arrested \nin September 2018 and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.a-2.b) All these allegation were also cross-alleged as personal conduct concerns. (SOR \n\u00b6 3.a) \nApplicant admitted that his marijuana use began after he started working for DC in \nMarch 2018. Before that, he had never tried it. By the time of his first use, he had \ncompleted filing out his security clearance application (SCA) and he was aware that \nmarijuana use violated DC\u2019s drug abstinence policy. He also knew that using marijuana \nviolated both federal and state law at the time. He associated with people at a commercial \njob who had access to marijuana in vape form and that is the method he used to ingest \nmarijuana. He used marijuana approximately six times while holding a security clearance \nwith the last time being in August 2019. He also stated in interrogatory responses that \n\u201cmy future drug use will remain sporadic and recreational.\u201d In November 2020, marijuana \nuse became legal for recreational use under the state law of his residence. During his \nhearing testimony he modified that position somewhat by claiming that he would only use \nmarijuana in the future if it was legal under federal law. He did not submit a signed \nstatement of intent not to use marijuana in the future.

These were his drinking \nhabits in about August 2018. He would drink five or six beers, or two to four cocktails, \nonce or twice a week with friends. In his SOR answer and during his testimony, he \nmodified the amount of alcohol he is now consuming. He claims that he cut back his \nalcohol use in 2019 to about one to two beers or cocktails per month. He does not \nregularly become intoxicated anymore. The last time he was intoxicated was in October \n2020 at his parents\u2019 Halloween party. There is no evidence of his alcohol use causing a \nlegal or employment issue. He has not been diagnosed with an alcohol abuse disorder. \n(Tr. 31, 45, 49-50; GE 3; Answer to SOR) \nAt approximately three a.m. on October 15, 2018, Applicant was arrested for \ncontributing to the delinquency of a minor. He was 22 years old at the time and was with \ntwo females, ages 18 and 15. The 18-year-old female was driving Applicant\u2019s car in a \nresidential neighborhood. The car was stopped by police and it was determined that the \n18-year-old had a blood alcohol content of .06 percent, which is over the legal limit for \nsomeone under age 21. Both Applicant and the 15-year-old had negative blood alcohol \ntest results. After initially denying that he provided the alcohol to the driver, he later \nadmitted doing so. He was arrested and pleaded guilty through a pre-trial diversion \nprogram. He satisfied all the terms of his diversion and after six months, the charges were \ndismissed. Applicant explained that he was associating with the wrong crowd at that time \nand he stopped doing so. He has not associated with those two females since the \nincident. (Tr. 32, GE 2; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant admitted that he did not report the arrest to his security officer at DC or \nto his parents. He claims that he was not aware of his duty to report the arrest to his \nsecurity officer. He admitted that his nondisclosure to his parents was partly based on \nhim wanting to handle the incident himself, and partly based on his desire to keep the \ninformation from them. (Tr. 42, 52-53) \nApplicant presented two character letters from a coworker from DC and from his \ngeneral manager from a commercial job he held. Both noted that he is reliable and \ncompetent at his job. Both felt that he is an excellent employee. An appraisal from DC for \nhis 2019 internship acknowledged that he fulfilled management\u2019s expectations of him with \nsolid contributions to the team. Over the course of several internships in 2018 and 2019, \nhe was recognized with two \u201cSpot Awards\u201d and three \u201cAchievement Awards.\u201d \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state \nlaw (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the \nnational security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law \nconcerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making \neligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant used marijuana on six occasions between March 2018 and August 2019. \nHe used marijuana after being granted an interim secret clearance. In his answers to \ninterrogatories in February 2019, he stated his intent was to continue using marijuana. I \nfind all the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana on several occasions and as recently as August 2019, \nwhile holding a security clearance. Given his pattern of use, his claimed abstinence \nbeginning in August 2019 is not sufficient to overcome his recent drug use. He did not \nprovide a signed statement of intent to abstain from all future illegal drug use. Additionally, \nas recently as August 2019, he indicated his intent was to continue his use of marijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s claimed abstinence is insufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. \nThe frequency and recency of his past use and his recent statement of intent to continue \nhis use casts doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and AG 26(b) do not apply. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest in 2018 for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, involved \nalcohol in the sense that he provided the alcohol that an 18-year-old consumed before \ndriving. However, Applicant did not consume alcohol on that occasion. AG \u00b6 22(a) does \nnot apply under these facts. The only evidence that Applicant binged alcohol for a time \ncame from his admissions. However, his recent testimony concerning the amount he \nregularly consumes (one to two beers or cocktails per month) does not fall into what would \nbe considered a \u201cbinge\u201d category. AG \u00b6 22(b) minimally applies. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol binging was infrequent, has stopped, and it does not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) applies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana soon after he completed his SCA and after he was \ngranted an interim clearance, with full awareness that such use violated state and Federal \nlaw and was against his employer\u2019s drug policy, is very troubling. Additionally, his \nstatement of future intent to use marijuana is also cause for concern. His poor judgment \nwas also apparent when he was arrested for contributing to the delinquency of a minor in \n2018. Cumulatively, all these actions raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. Based upon the general personal conduct security concern, AG \u00b6 15 is \nraised by the evidence. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAppellant\u2019s use of marijuana, as recently as August 2019, while holding a security \nclearance, his expressed intent to continue his use in the future, and his poor judgment \nin associating with minors which led to his arrest are not minor. His actions cast doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b617(c) does not apply. Although \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant claims he no longer associates with the minors with whom he was arrested and \nhas modified his drinking habits, there is still concern that the behavior may recur. AG \u00b6 \n17(d) does not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, his \ncharacter statements, and his work evaluation and awards received. However, I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s poor decisions of starting to use marijuana after he completed his \nSCA and began his job at DC, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor when he \nwas driving around a residential neighborhood with two females, ages 18 and 15, at three \na.m. allowing the 18-year-old driver access to alcohol. He also kept his arrest information \nfrom his employer and his parents. Although the alcohol consumption concerns are \nmitigated, Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the drug involvement \nand personal conduct security concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines H and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n8 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

On November 27, 2019, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H. The SOR \ndetailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nOn February 5, 2020, Applicant responded through counsel to the SOR. On July \n29, 2020, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On August 4, 2020, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On September 23, \n2020, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing for September 29, 2020. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled.

He did not complete his \ncollege requirements until October 2017, and was awarded a bachelor of science \ndegree in physics in December 2017. (Tr. 15-16; GE 1) Applicant has never married \nand has no dependents. (Tr. 16-17) He has held a Secret security clearance since July \n2015, and has a pending application to upgrade his clearance to Top Secret. \nMaintaining a clearance is a requirement of his continued employment. (Tr. 17-18, 56) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nIn his June 15, 2015 SF-86, Applicant disclosed his marijuana use that spanned \na period of time from May 2010 to December 2013. He was introduced to marijuana as \na freshman on the high school baseball team, having smoked marijuana about 25 times \nduring his high school years, and \u201ccompletely stopped\u201d in his senior year. He used \nmarijuana again as a freshman in college \u201cabout 3 times.\u201d Applicant added in that same \nSF-86: \nI have not done any drugs since my first semester, freshman year, in \ncollege. . . . I have done an incredible amount of growing since then, in \nhigh school, I stopped spending time with the crowd that I smoked with. . . \n. the \u201cbenefits\u201d of doing any drug is in no way even close to the level of \nsatisfaction that I get from doing my job here at [defense contractor] and \nthe possible benefits that would come later with a security clearance. To \njeopardize my future in this industry (and everything that I have worked \nfor) for a couple of hours of \u201cbeing high is an idiotic choice that I will never \nmake. I will never use this drug, nor any other drug in the future. (GE 2; Tr. \n57-60, 74-76) \nAt the time Applicant completed his June 15, 2015 SF-86, he did not have a \nsecurity clearance. However, he was subsequently granted access to classified \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation with a Secret security clearance in July 2015. (SOR; Tr. 60) Applicant took \nand passed a drug test when he began working in June 2015. (Tr. 60) \nIn his June 11, 2018 SF-86, which Applicant completed when he sought to \nupgrade his clearance from Secret to Top Secret, he disclosed additional drug use. It \nwas these disclosures that formed the basis for the majority of security concerns alleged \nin Applicant\u2019s SOR. He admitted using marijuana intermittently from May 2010 to May \n2018 \u201caround a hundred\u201d times, which included his admitted marijuana use in his June \n15, 2015 SF-86. Additionally, he admitted using cocaine from April 2016 to March 2017 \nfive to six times; using MDMA from December 2016 to April 2018 six times; using \nlysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in August 2017 one time; using prescription medication \nHydrocodone without a prescription in March 2017 three times; and using prescription \nmedication Adderall without a prescription from April 2017 to April 2018 four times. As \nnoted, Applicant previously admitted using marijuana; however, he continued using \nmarijuana after being granted access to classified information in July 2015 as well \ncocaine, Ecstasy or MDMA, LSD, prescription medication Hydrocodone, and \nprescription medication Adderall. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.f; Tr. 69-70) \nApplicant\u2019s admitted drug use in his June 11, 2018 SF-86 is consistent with his \nprevious admitted drug use in his June 15, 2015 SF-86, and subsequent drug use he \ndescribed in his March 12, 2019 Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject \nInterview (OPM PSI), his SOR Answer; and during his hearing testimony. (GE 2, GE 3; \nSOR Answer; Tr. 24-48, 60-65, 67-68, 72-73) Applicant disclosed his drug use on his \nJune 11, 2018 SF-86 to avoid being \u201cvulnerable for blackmail.\u201d (Tr. 72) \nWhen queried by Department Counsel why he did not cease drug use after \nbecoming a full-time employee, Applicant stated: \n \nI think I was still immature. Coming out of college doesn\u2019t just \u2013 there\u2019s not \njust a slick straight graduate and all of a sudden you\u2019re a fully-developed \ngrown man. There are things that happen along the way that shape your \ncharacter. And unfortunately for me, I was somewhat sheltered, so I didn\u2019t \nget to experience anything \u2013 any real negative effects until later on. And \nI\u2019m sorry that it happened too late, but up until that point, that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 I \ndidn\u2019t get any experience. That was \u2013 I formed that maturity in my head \nlater. (Tr. 65-66, 76) \nApplicant stated that he stopped using all drugs in May 2018. His marijuana use \nup until that point was averaging, \u201c. . . two to three times a week, so it wasn\u2019t irregular \nfor me to come home and smoke on my balcony. And this day was similar to what I\u2019d \nbeen doing the last year or so. I smoked. And then an hour or so later, I got a phone call \nfrom my mom. I decided I didn\u2019t want to talk to her \u2018cause I was high at the time. And \njust thought, you know, I\u2019ll deal with it tomorrow.\u201d (Tr. 29-31) Applicant\u2019s mother left him \na voice mail telling him that his grandmother was hospitalized and she needed to talk to \nhim. He later realized other people were counting on him and that he needed to grow up \nand could not be \u201can irresponsible college kid anymore.\u201d (Tr. 31-32, 34, 41, 68-71) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that his drug use was illegal and such use was prohibited \nunder federal regulations.

He stated that he would remove himself from any situation \nwhere drug use was present. (Tr. 34-35, 50-51) Applicant submitted a signed statement \nof intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n(Tr. 48; AE A) To demonstrate his drug-free status, Applicant submitted two negative \nhair follicle drug tests dated January 24, 2020 and October 1, 2020, and stated that he \nwould be willing to take random drug tests in the future. (Tr. 48-50; AE B, AE G) \nApplicant has never been arrested, charged, or convicted for a drug-related offense. He \nhas not participated in any voluntary or court-ordered drug rehabilitation programs. \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his past drug abuse, expressed remorse, and \nstated that he has no desire or intention to use drugs in the future. (Tr. 49, 51-53) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant submitted five reference letters from a cross section of individuals to \ninclude a company senior manager, a company staff engineer, a coworker, his sister, \nand a long-time friend. His senior manager described his work ethic, integrity, \ntrustworthiness, and the significant contribution he makes towards the nation\u2019s defense. \nApplicant\u2019s coworker provided a similar favorable endorsement. Applicant\u2019s sister and \nlong-time friend provided favorable character assessments supported by accounts of \ntheir past personal interactions with him. All five letters are supportive of granting \nApplicant access to classified information. (AE C, AE H) \nApplicant also provided numerous awards that he received from 2017 to 2020 \nand his performance appraisals for 2019, 2018, and 2016 as well as his current resume. \nApplicant\u2019s appraisals identify him as a top-shelf performer, who is a valued and trusted \ncompany employee. (AE D, AE E; AE F) Applicant discussed his accomplishments, \nwhich are further documented in his performance appraisals and awards. (Tr. 19-24) \nApart from work, which lately has been at home, he spends his free time biking, rock \nclimbing, watching sports, and playing video games. Applicant leads a healthy lifestyle \nthat is not consistent with drug use. (Tr. 54) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern concerning drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nTwo drug involvement disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(f) could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany substance misuse \n(see above definition);\u201d and \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position.\u201d These proceedings were initiated after \nApplicant self-reported his history of drug involvement and substance misuse on his \nJune 15, 2015 SF-86, on his June 11, 2018 SF-86, and in his March 12, 2019 OPM PSI. \nAll of his drug use was affirmed in his SOR Answer, and in his hearing testimony. \nConsideration of the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) can mitigate security concerns when drug offenses are not recent. \nThere are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when such conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The \ndetermination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within \nthe parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. \nAug. 28, 1997), that an applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 \nmonths before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on \nthe absence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board \ndetermined that the judge excessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security \nclearance, and the 20 plus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle \nchanges and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal Board stated: \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd.

May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format made). \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, affirmed \nthe administrative judge\u2019s decision to revoke an applicant\u2019s security clearance after \nconsidering the recency analysis of an administrative judge stating:  \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and \nserious history of improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant \nwho was familiar with the security clearance process. That history \nincluded illegal marijuana use two to three times a year from 1974 to 2002 \n[drug use ended four years before hearing]. It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security \nclearance. \nSee also ISCR Case No. 02-10454 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2004) (sustaining denial of \nsecurity clearance for Applicant who used marijuana five times while holding a \nsecurity clearance with four years between most recent marijuana use and \nhearing). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe passage of time after ending drug use is not considered in isolation. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use, to include marijuana, cocaine, MDMA, LSD, prescription \nmedication Hydrocodone, and prescription medication Adderall use after completing his \nJune 15, 2015, SF-86, being granted a security clearance in July 2015, and starting \nwork full-time in June 2017 is more significant in this case. See ISCR Case No. 06-\n18270 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007) (marijuana use after completing an SF-86 \n\u201cundercuts\u201d favorable application of the drug involvement recency mitigating condition).  \nApplicant acknowledged that he used marijuana intermittently from May 2010 to \nMay 2018 about 100 times, used cocaine from April 2016 to March 2017 five to six \ntimes, used MDMA from December 2016 to April 2018 six times, used LSD in August \n2017 one time, used prescription medication Hydrocodone in March 2017 three times, \nand used prescription medication Adderall from April 2017 to April 2018 four times. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use continued after assuring adjudication officials that he would not use \ndrugs again when he completed his June 15, 2015 SF-86, after he was granted a \nSecret security clearance in July 2015, and after he became a full-time employee in July \n2017. \nApplicant recognized the adverse impact on his life of drug abuse in connection \nwith access to classified information. I accept Applicant\u2019s statements in his SF-86s, to \nthe OPM investigator, in his SOR response, and at his hearing as credible, and he \nsincerely intended to abstain from future drug possession and use. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies \nin part to his illegal-drug-related conduct because it is not particularly recent. However, \nthe continued use of marijuana and a variety of other illegal drugs while holding a \nsecurity clearance and becoming a full-time employee post-college shows a profound \nlack of judgment. More time without drug use is necessary to assure that drug use is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nApplicant demonstrated his intent not to abuse illegal drugs in the future. He has \nnot used illegal drugs since May 2018, approximately two years and four months before \nhis hearing, he has disassociated from drug-using associates and contacts, he has \navoided the environment where drugs were used, and he has provided a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable \nunder the facts of this case. \nIn conclusion, Applicant possessed and used a variety of drugs on multiple \noccasions from May 2010 to May 2018. He continued to use marijuana and used a \nvariety of other drugs after being granted a security clearance in July 2015. The \nmotivations to stop using illegal drugs are evident. He understands the adverse \nconsequences from illegal drugs. Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal \nliability for possession of drugs and adverse health, employment, and personal effects \nresulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for remaining drug free. More \ntime must elapse without any drug use to demonstrate a sufficient track record of no \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrug abuse to establish rehabilitation and eliminate drug involvement as a bar to his \naccess to classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthe factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nThe factors supporting continuation of Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility are \nsignificant; however, they are insufficient at present. He was forthright and candid in his \nSF-86s, in his OPM interview, in his responses to DOHA interrogatories, in his SOR \nresponse, and at his hearing about his drug use. Applicant achieved some important \neducation and employment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility, and \ndedication. He served successfully as a summer intern during the summers of 2015, \n2016, and 2017 until being granted full-time status in October 2017 with a defense \ncontractor. His supervisors laud his contributions to the defense contractor and note his \nextraordinary potential. By all accounts, he is an honest, caring, diligent, intelligent, and \nresponsible person. He disclosed his drug use to his family and supervisors. His \nsupervisors are very supportive of his continued employment. There is no evidence of \nany security violations since being granted a security clearance in July 2015. Applicant \nunderstands why his drug possession and use was improper, and he does not intend to \nuse illegal drugs in the future. \nThe rationale for revoking Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial. His \ndecisions to possess and use illegal drugs after completing his June 15, 2015 SF-86 \nand being granted a Secret security clearance in July 2015, and after becoming a full-\ntime employee in October 2017 were imprudent, irresponsible, reckless, and improper. \nNot only did his marijuana use continue after being granted a clearance, but he \nexpanded his illegal drug use to include cocaine, MDMA, LSD, Hydrocodone, and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nAdderall. He did not complete a drug rehabilitation or counseling program. He has \nrefrained from using a variety of drugs for two years and four months. His drug use \n\u201craises questions about [his] ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 24. More time without illegal drug use is necessary to credit him with \nbeing fully rehabilitated and to entrust him with access to classified information. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse concerns are not mitigated. For the reasons stated, Applicant is not \neligible for access to classified information at this time.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

(GE 1, GE 2, GE 3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 2011, and received a discharge in \nFebruary 2012. He subsequently accrued four delinquent debts totaling $76,491. The \nrecord evidence establishes concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further review is \nnecessary. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potential mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd.

However, Applicant does not receive full credit under either \nof these two mitigating conditions because of his failure to act responsibly under the \ncircumstances and the time elapsed before addressing these four debts.  \nAdmittedly, Applicant\u2019s divorce placed him in a very difficult position after he \nseparated from his fourth wife in March 2015. He had agreed to give her the house, car, \nmotorcycle, and cell phones. His wife was supposed to make the house, car, and \nmotorcycle payments out of his monthly $5,000 spousal and child support payments. \nShe failed to do so. One month after separating in April 2015, she assaulted him and \nseriously damaged their motorcycle at the body shop. During and after this time, the \ncommunication between the couple was toxic and minimal at best. However, when it \ncame to Applicant\u2019s attention that his wife was not making payments, he failed to take \ncorrective action and make the payments as a party legally responsible for doing so, or \nat a minimum contact the creditors, and explain the situation. The family court judge had \nordered Applicant to make the house payments and withhold that amount from his \nmonthly support payments. Applicant failed to obey the family court judge. Applicant \nacknowledges that he made some poor decisions. \nWith that said, Applicant divorced his fourth wife, remarried, and his situation \nappears stable. All of the delinquent SOR accounts have been resolved. His reticence \nfor not stepping up as a legally responsible party was further compounded by confusion \nregarding the status of the debts in question and his obligation to pay them. Time and \napplicable state law led to the resolution of the delinquent mortgage being satisfied by \nforeclosure and subsequent proceeds from the sale. The Dodge Caravan lender issued \nApplicant a Form 1099-C, which he filed with his 2019 federal income tax return. The \nHarley Davidson and cell phone accounts were settled for lesser amounts January 2021 \nand December 2019, respectively, and have been resolved. I considered all of the \ncircumstances involved in the resolution of Applicant\u2019s debts, including his lapses in \ndebt resolution, and not simply that the creditors elected not to pursue Applicant for full \npayment or that ultimately all debts are now resolved or current. See ISCR Case No. \n20-01004 at 3 (App. Bd. June 28, 2021). AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(e) are not applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis \nsection under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further \ncomments are warranted. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old lead systems engineer for integration and test \nemployed by a defense contractor since November 2020. Both the mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline F and the whole-person analysis support a favorable decision. \nApplicant\u2019s years of service in the U.S. Army and employment as a defense contractor \nwhile successfully holding a clearance weigh in his favor. He is a law-abiding citizen and \na productive member of society. He is current on his day-to-day expenses, lives within \nhis means, and his SOR debts have been resolved. He has provided evidence of being \na productive, loyal, and responsible employee. He is a devoted father and stepfather \nand is current on all of his monthly expenses. Applicant understands what he needs to \ndo to establish and maintain his financial responsibility. He has regained his financial \nfooting to the point where he recently qualified for a $340,600 home loan. \nApplicant has also contributed more than many applicants to the service of his \ncountry as evidenced by his 11 years of active duty, which included three tours in an \nimminent danger pay area for two tours in Iraq and one tour in Afghanistan. Of note, he \nwas awarded an Air Medal and two Army Commendation Medals, as well as a number \nof other medals. The VA has also awarded him a 100% disability rating for post \ntraumatic stress disorder and serious injuries he sustained after two helicopter crashes. \nIn addition, a contentious and acrimonious divorce, especially where children are \ninvolved, is likely to cloud one\u2019s judgment. Applicant is no exception. At age 47, \nApplicant appears to have regained his footing after his Army service and four failed \nmarriages. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n11 \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, \n2017. \nOn February 25, 2020, Applicant answered the SOR allegations, admitting all of the \nallegations, and requesting a hearing. The case was assigned to me on September 1, \n2020. On November 3, 2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \nof hearing, scheduling the case for November 6, 2020. Applicant waived his right to a 15-\nday notice of hearing. \n \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. I incorporated three government exhibits into \nthe record, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3, and I incorporated 15 \nApplicant exhibits (AE), incorporated into the record as AE A through AE O. In addition, I \nreceived the testimony of Applicant and two character witnesses. The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on November 17, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \n \n Applicant is a 49-year-old, married man. He has a six-year-old child from his \nmarriage and an adult child from a prior relationship. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1995. Currently, he is a federal contractor who works in the information technology field. He \nhas been working for the same company since 2005, and was promoted to his current \nposition as a supervisor in 2010. He has held a top secret clearance since 2011. (Tr. 36) \n \n \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. According to a coworker, Applicant is a \u201cfair, \nunbiased, even-tempered, conscientious, and hardworking\u201d employee who goes above and \nbeyond in mentoring his subordinates. (AE D1 at 1) According to a former supervisor, \nApplicant \u201ccontinuously demonstrated sound judgment at work.\u201d (AE D2 at 1) \n \n \nApplicant began smoking marijuana in 1989 while in high school, using it once per \nweek. In college, he used it a few times per week. (Tr. 32) In 1995, Applicant was charged \nwith possession of marijuana, and was sentenced to six months of probation. (Tr. 32-33) \nHe continued to use marijuana for three years after his arrest. In 1998, Applicant came to \nrealize that his marijuana-smoking habit was not productive. (Tr. 34) Consequently, he quit \nusing it. \n \n \nIn late 2014, Applicant was diagnosed with Stage 3 rectal cancer. (AE K) He had to \nundergo chemotherapy. The chemotherapy medications made him extremely nauseated \nand miserable. (Tr.  21) In response, his doctor prescribed anti-nausea medications, but \nthey proved to be unsuccessful. (Answer at 3; Tr. 20, 36) Applicant was afraid that he was \ngoing to die. (Tr. 21) One of his friends suggested that he use marijuana to alleviate his \nnausea. (Tr. 21) Applicant then resumed his marijuana use. He used marijuana throughout \nhis chemotherapy treatment, which lasted from December 2014 to March 2015. He was on \nshort-term disability leave from work when he was using marijuana.  \n \n \nBy March 2015, Applicant\u2019s cancer had gone into remission. He discontinued his \nmarijuana use. Approximately three years later, in July 2018, Applicant used marijuana \nagain on two occasions. (Tr. 21) He used it with his brother who was living with him at the \ntime, and who had purchased it in a jurisdiction where it was legal. (Tr. 21) When Applicant \nused marijuana in 2018, he was not undergoing chemotherapy treatment, as his cancer \nwas still in remission. (Tr. 22) Applicant recognizes that he made \u201ca terrible mistake,\u201d and \nthat regardless of whether it is legal in some state jurisdictions, it remains illegal under \nfederal law, and is prohibited for people holding security clearances.

(AE J) \nIn October 2020, Applicant underwent a mental health and substance abuse assessment. \n(AE M) Part of the assessment included a Brief Addiction Monitor, \u201can evidence-based \nmeasurement used to establish a baseline of substance use and risk and protective \nfactors.\u201d Based on the assessment, Applicant did not meet any of the minimum criteria for \nsubstance use concerns. (AE M) \nApplicant has not smoked marijuana since July 2018. His brother no longer smokes \nmarijuana and no longer lives with him. (Tr. 24) Applicant does not intend to use marijuana \nin the future even if his cancer recurs. (Tr. 28) On February 11, 2020, Applicant executed \nan affidavit expressing his intent not to use marijuana again, and acknowledging that any \nfuture use is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (AE I) Applicant stated on \na security clearance application completed in 2011 that he would not resume his marijuana \nuse, and he reiterated his intent not to resume marijuana use on his security clearance \napplication completed in January 2018. (GE 1 at 31) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance abuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to  comply with laws, rules, and regulations.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s intermittent use of marijuana between 1989 and 2018, including several \noccasions when he held a security clearance, triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany \nsubstance abuse,\u201d and 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position.\u201d   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstance that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of action to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) warrants some consideration. Applicant voluntarily completed a drug awareness \neducation class. The class counselor evaluated him and concluded he had no substance \nabuse concerns. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s brother, the last person with whom he used \nmarijuana, no longer lives with Applicant. Applicant signed an affidavit expressing his intent \nto abstain from future marijuana use. \nConversely, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use between 2014 and 2018 overlapped with the \nperiod he held a security clearance. When Applicant decided to resume his marijuana use \nin 2014, after a 16-year hiatus, he had recently been diagnosed with Stage 3 rectal cancer, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas suffering with uncontrolled nausea, was on extended sick leave, and thought he was \ngoing to die. Applicant\u2019s resumption of marijuana under these extraordinary circumstances \n\u2013 understanding that it could alleviate his suffering - would present little current security \nconcern were it not for the recurrent use in 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 usage, however, was after his cancer was in remission, and several \nmonths after he completed a security clearance application on which he promised never to \nuse marijuana in the future. Under these circumstances, the application of AG \u00b6 26(b) has \nlimited probative value. \nThe nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s resumption of marijuana use after his \ncancer was in remission is compounded by the fact that he held a security clearance at the \ntime, and had completed a security clearance application promising not to smoke marijuana \nin the future. Under these circumstances, the possibility of recurrence remains \nunacceptably high. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply, and that Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the drug involvement security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI considered the whole-person factors when I analyzed the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under the drug involvement guideline, and they do not warrant a \nfavorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

On April 22, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nissued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for May 14, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 40-year-old married man.

(GE 1 at 7) He was not particularly \nknowledgeable about financial management. (Tr. 18) Consequently, he fell behind on his \nmortgage payments. Ultimately, he began to fall behind on both consumer debts and \nfederal income tax debts for tax years 2011 to 2013. (GE 5 at 2; GE 13 at 9) \nSubsequently, Applicant obtained a mortgage loan modification. As of July 2019, his \nmortgage payments were current. (GE 8) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owes $2,785 on four delinquent accounts. Applicant \nowes $1,067 for the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. In March 2021, he negotiated payment \nplan with the creditor and made the first payment on March 23, 2021. Applicant owes $867 \non a store credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He paid the debt and the account has since \nbeen removed from his credit report. The SOR alleged in \u00b6 1.c. that Applicant owed $417 \non a delinquent credit card. He satisfied this debt in March 2021. The SOR also alleges \nthat Applicant owed $434 on another store credit card account. \nIn addition to the consumer credit accounts, Applicant also owes $15,288 in federal \nincome taxes. He fell behind because he incorrectly filed his tax return as a 1099 \ncontractor.

(AE 9) \nWork Performance Issues \nApplicant has worked for federal contracting companies since 2005. Between 2008 \nand 2010, Applicant was employed by Company A, as a background investigator. In 2010, \nApplicant started a business doing security clearance background investigations. From \n2010 to 2016, he worked as an independent contractor to Companies B, C, and D, on \ncontracts with OPM and other federal agencies. Applicant closed his business in 2016 and \nwent to work for Company E as a personnel security specialist from 2017 to 2018. \nDuring the two years that Applicant worked with Company A, he, received four \nwritten warnings about his poor work performance. He signed one of the warnings in \nFebruary 2009, certifying that he received it, and he prepared a response that was \nincorporated into his personnel file with the warning. (GE 3 at 6) Similarly, he signed a \nwarning that he received in May 2009. (GE 3 at 6) In or around August 2010, he was fired \nfrom a company for unsatisfactory performance, as alleged in subparagraph 2.e. \nApplicant\u2019s multiple reprimands at Company A led to his dismissal in 2010. \nAfter being dismissed from Company A in 2010, he began working with Company B \nas an independent contractor. (GE 6 at 1) He was fired in November 2011 \u201cbecause of \npoor performance/timeliness/quality and communication issues,\u201d as alleged in \nsubparagraph 2.f.

SOR subparagraphs 2.m and 2.u allege that \nApplicant\u2019s subsequent omission of this job during subject interviews in 2015 and 2020 \nconstitute intentional omissions. Applicant contends that although he worked for this \ncompany in 2018, he did not work for it before completing the security clearance \napplication, contrary to the SOR allegation. (Answer at 4) The facility security officer \nconfirmed that Applicant worked at this company for two periods. The first period was \nbefore the completion of the security clearance application.

Applicant received copies of both subject interviews after \ncompleting them. He had the opportunity to review both investigator summaries, and make \nany additions. Applicant certified that he read both investigator summaries. (GE 14 at 4; \nGE 15 at 4) Neither report indicates that he disclosed these terminations. \nSubparagraph 2.k alleges that Applicant, when completing the 2015 security \nclearance application, falsely characterized the reason for leaving the company where he \nwas dismissed in 2010, as for career advancement, and subparagraph 2.l alleges that he \nfailed to disclose the multiple disciplinary measures and written warnings that he received \nbefore his termination. During an investigative interview in 2015, he clarified the nature of \nhis departure. (GE 13 at 4) Applicant also discussed at length his contentious relationship \nwith management, how he disagreed with the disciplinary measures that they imposed, and \nhow this contentious relationship led to his decision to file a wrongful termination claim after \nhis dismissal. (GE 13 at 4) In Applicant\u2019s answer, he indicated that he did not recall being \nterminated from this company. (Answer at 4) \nSOR subparagraph 2.k alleges that the mischaracterization of his termination on the \nsecurity clearance application and subsequent investigative interviews in 2015 and 2020, \nconstitute falsifications, as alleged in subparagraphs 2.l and 2.u. During an investigative \ninterview in 2015, Applicant disclosed this information \u201cprior to . . . being confronted with \n[the] developed employment record. . . . .\u201d (GE 13 at 4) He also discussed the \ncircumstances surrounding his termination, including the company\u2019s contentions regarding \nhis incompetent performance, together with the wrongful termination lawsuit he filed \nagainst the company after he was terminated.

The record contains evidence of e-mail between Applicant and his \nemployer regarding a request for documentation. (GE 5 at 16) The e-mail correspondence \ndoes not specify the documentation sought, nor does it contain any warnings. \nThe e-mail correspondence set forth in GE 5 does reference Applicant\u2019s poor work \nperformance.

(Item \n5 at 16) \nFour months later, Applicant\u2019s employer fired him for poor performance, as alleged in SOR \nsubparagraph 2.t. (Answer at 5) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts generates security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s outstanding federal income tax debt triggers the application of AG \n\u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused, in part, by the often erratic income he \nearned when he first began working as an independent contractor in 2010. (GE 13 at 9). As \nhis income gradually stabilized he began contacting his creditors to begin paying the debts. \nCurrently, all of the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d have either been paid, \nor are being paid through payment plans. I resolve these subparagraphs in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable. \nAlthough Applicant has been paying his tax delinquency through an installment plan \nsince 2018, he is currently one month behind on payments. Because Applicant is not in \ncompliance with the payment plan, only the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \nUltimately, given Applicant\u2019s outstanding tax delinquency, and his current trouble \ncomplying with the payment plan, it is too soon to conclude he has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concern. \nPersonal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) \nApplicant, a security clearance investigator, has been fired from five jobs in the past \n11 years. His work performance at one of his jobs was so egregious that it prompted an \nOPM audit of his case load in 2015. Personnel security investigators are critical to the \nevaluation of applicants\u2019 security-worthiness. Incomplete case reports, unreported leads, or \npertinent fact-gathering follow-ups that are overlooked \u2013 all oversights or failures that \nApplicant has demonstrated throughout his career \u2013 undermine the ability of adjudicators \nto make accurate security evaluations, and could result in undeserving individuals receiving \nclearances, or \nmore importantly, deserving individuals being denied clearances. \nConsequently, although the guidelines do not explicitly address personnel concerns, \noutside of security infractions, the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s personnel \nproblems is significant enough to trigger the unmitigated application of AG \u00b6 20(e), as \nfollows: \nCredible adverse information . . . that is not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered \nas a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s omissions from his security clearance application and from successive \nsubject interviews raise the issue of whether \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. (AG \u00b6 16(a) \nThe evidence supporting the allegations set forth in SOR subparagraphs 2.q and 2.s \nis inconclusive. I resolve them in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant was fired from one of his \njobs, in part, because of falsely reporting that he had contacted a subject when he had not. \nGiven that a falsification constitutes the basis of one of his terminations, the credibility of \nhis subsequent explanations regarding his multiple omissions and mischaracterizations \nduring the investigations process is fatally undercut. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to the \nremaining allegations without mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept factors in my analysis of the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under the alleged guidelines, and it does not warrant a favorable \nconclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.q: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.r: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.s: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.t \u2013 2.u: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 28 years old. He has a high school diploma and a few semesters of college. He holds the positon of Senior Composite Fabricator and Assembler for a defense contractor. He seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. The SOR alleges that Applicant has ten delinquent accounts totaling approximately $28,000. In addition, Applicant failed to file his Federal and State income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2017. In his Answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations and provides explanations. Credit reports of the Applicant dated September 26, 2018; March 16, 2020; and November 8, 2020, reflect that each of these debts was at one time delinquent and owing. (Government Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.) Applicant explained that a friend told him that if he did not owe taxes, he did not have to file his income tax returns every year, and that there was no problem with filing two years at one time in order to get two refund checks at one time. Consequently, Applicant listened to his friend and deliberately did not file his Federal and State income tax returns in a timely fashion for tax years 2011 through 2017. (Tr. pp. 46 - 49.) Upon realizing that this information was bad and erroneous, Applicant states that he properly filed all of his Federal and State income tax returns including those for tax years 2015 and 2017, and has paid all of the back taxes he owed.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 24, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 28, 2020. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on September 29, 2020, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on November 10, 2020. The Government offered six exhibits, referred to as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 6. Applicant objected to Government Exhibit 5 because \nthe credit report was not his, but was his fathers.

The record remained open until close of business on November 20, 2020, to \nallow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional supporting documentation. \nApplicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing \nExhibit A, which was admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 18, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 28 years old. He has a high school diploma and a few semesters of \ncollege. He holds the positon of Senior Composite Fabricator and Assembler for a \ndefense contractor. He seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment in the defense industry. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has ten delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $28,000. In addition, Applicant failed to file his Federal and State income \ntax returns for tax years 2015 and 2017. In his Answer, Applicant admits each of the \nallegations and provides explanations. Credit reports of the Applicant dated September \n26, 2018; March 16, 2020; and November 8, 2020, reflect that each of these debts was \nat one time delinquent and owing. (Government Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.) \nApplicant explained that a friend told him that if he did not owe taxes, he did not \nhave to file his income tax returns every year, and that there was no problem with filing \ntwo years at one time in order to get two refund checks at one time. Consequently, \nApplicant listened to his friend and deliberately did not file his Federal and State income \ntax returns in a timely fashion for tax years 2011 through 2017. (Tr. pp. 46 - 49.) Upon \nrealizing that this information was bad and erroneous, Applicant states that he properly \nfiled all of his Federal and State income tax returns including those for tax years 2015 \nand 2017, and has paid all of the back taxes he owed. (Tr. pp. 47- 48 and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit C.) \nApplicant has been working for his current employer for the past two years. He \nstated that until he was hired by his current employer, he was never well compensated, \nand he could not afford to pay his bills. To worsen matters, in 2013, Applicant was \ninvolved in a motorcycle accident on his way to work. He broke his back, lost his job, \nand was bedridden for almost eight months. By the time he was able to get back on his \nfeet and back to work, a number of delinquent debts had accumulated. He could not \nafford to pay those bills and support the immediate needs of his family.  \nIn 2016/2017, Applicant hired a debt consolidation firm to assist him in resolving \nhis debt. They charged him $26 monthly and did nothing to assist him. He fired the firm \nand began working toward resolving his debts himself.  (Tr. p. 50.)  \nApplicant applied for a security clearance in August 2018. He was subsequently \ninterviewed by an investigator about his indebtedness. At that time, Applicant learned \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n         \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n    \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthe real importance of being financially responsible.  Since then, Applicant has made an \nassertive effort to resolve his debts.      \nThe following delinquent debts listed in the SOR have been resolved or are being \nresolved: \n1.b. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a delinquent debt that was placed \nfor collection in the approximate amount of $30. Applicant has satisfied this debt. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \n1.c. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a delinquent account placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $79. \nApplicant has satisfied the debt. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.) \n1.d. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a delinquent account placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $79. \nApplicant has satisfied the debt. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.) \n1.e. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a delinquent account placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $26,592. \nApplicant is making monthly \npayments of $300 toward this debt, and he plans to continue until the debt is paid in full.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.) \n1.f. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a delinquent account placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $202. \nApplicant has satisfied the debt. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.) \n1.g. This is a delinquent debt for an account that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $202. Applicant has satisfied the debt. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.) \n1.h. This is a delinquent medical debt that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $118. Applicant has satisfied the debt. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.) \n1.i. \nThis is a delinquent medical debt that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $116. Applicant has satisfied the debt. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.) \n1.j. \nThis is a delinquent medical debt that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $277. Applicant has satisfied the debt. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.) \n1.k. This a delinquent account placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$2,679. The debt has been resolved. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I.) \nFour letters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s coworkers and friends \ncollectively indicate that he is a young man of integrity, a hard worker and is well \nrespected. They are aware of his past financial problems, and they know that he is \ndiligently working to resolve his debts. \nThey describe Applicant as professional, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nknowledgeable, responsible and trustworthy.  He is recommended for a security \nclearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s previous employment did not pay well, and he was unable to pay his \nbills. He also mistakenly listened to a friend who gave him bad advice about his taxes. \nHe became delinquently indebted. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved  or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAs a na\u00efve young man, Applicant made some very poor decisions in the past, by \nlistening to a friend regarding his income tax filings, and he fell behind on his taxes. He \nalso incurred delinquent debt he could not afford to pay because of a motorcycle \naccident. At that time, he did not have employment that paid him sufficient monies to \npay his bills. Since gaining adequate employment, Applicant has paid off, and/or is \nmaking payments to resolve his debts. He has paid off his back taxes, and is making \npayments toward his debts that are outstanding. He has shown remarkable progress \ntoward resolving his debt, and he has acted reasonably and responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He intends to continue to resolve his debts. Applicant has shown \nmaturity, good judgment and reliability. There are clear indications that his financial \nproblems of the past are under control. He has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith \neffort to repay his overdue creditors. AG \u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) provide full mitigation. The \nFinancial Considerations concern has been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is a \nhardworking young man who made some poor financial decisions in the past. He has \nlearned from his past experience, and is working hard to resolve his debt. \nHe \nunderstands the importance of properly managing his finances in the future. He shows \ngreat potential and is well respected by those he works with. \nHe also clearly \nunderstands the great responsibilities he has in holding a security clearance. He has \nshown the requisite maturity, good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of \nthis privilege. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

He is engaged to the mother of two of his three children. He has two former wives. Applicant is attending school to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree. Applicant is seeking to obtain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A, 17; Tr. 7-9.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR alleged that Applicant owed approximately $44,633 in past-due indebtedness to various creditors. Applicant admitted allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.l, and 1.q. He denied the remaining allegations, stating those accounts were no longer delinquent. The existence and amount of the debts is supported by admissions of Applicant, and credit reports submitted by the Government dated April 6, 2019; August 19, 2019; and March 17, 2020. (Government Exhibits 2, 4, 5, and 6.) Applicant has a five-year-old daughter who has severe medical issues. She was born in April 2015 at 25-and-a-half-weeks gestation and weighing 2.5 pounds.

He is engaged to the mother of two of his three \nchildren. He has two former wives. Applicant is attending school to obtain a Bachelor of \nArts degree. Applicant is seeking to obtain national security eligibility and a security \nclearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A, 17; \nTr. 7-9.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed approximately $44,633 in past-due \nindebtedness to various creditors. Applicant admitted allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.l, \nand 1.q. He denied the remaining allegations, stating those accounts were no longer \ndelinquent. The existence and amount of the debts is supported by admissions of \nApplicant, and credit reports submitted by the Government dated April 6, 2019; August \n19, 2019; and March 17, 2020. (Government Exhibits 2, 4, 5, and 6.) \nApplicant has a five-year-old daughter who has severe medical issues. She was \nborn in April 2015 at 25-and-a-half-weeks gestation and weighing 2.5 pounds. Children \nthat are born before 28 weeks and under 3.5 pounds are known as a \u201cmicro-premie.\u201d The \nchild spent seven months in the neo-natal intensive care center at a nationally-known \nchildren\u2019s hospital. Applicant and his now-fianc\u00e9e spent almost every waking hour with \ntheir daughter. The medical bills for her care amounted to $3.7 million. Fortunately, most \nof that was covered by insurance and grants. However, Applicant had to pay \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napproximately $17,000 of the medical debts, and has been successfully doing so. His \ndaughter still requires constant medical supervision, as well as speech therapy and \nphysical therapy. Many of Applicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of his daughter\u2019s \nmedical condition and the resulting financial decisions he had to make. (Applicant Exhibits \nM and DD; Tr. 36-43.) \nApplicant began his current employment in March 2019 and his income \ndramatically increased. Since that time he has been able to begin making payments on \nhis formerly past-due indebtedness while maintaining his current payments. Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent financial condition is stable. (Government Exhibit 3 at 16; Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. \n63-64, 66.) \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed approximately $17,624 for a charged-off \nautomobile loan. He was unable to come to an arrangement with the creditor to pay the \ndebt. The holder of the debt obtained a judgment and has been collecting $376 from each \nof Applicant\u2019s paychecks since approximately April 2020. Applicant had paid $8,126 of \nthis debt as of September 20, 2020. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. \n27-32.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted that he owed $13,030 for a second charged-off vehicle \nloan. He made payments for several years but fell behind because of issues with his \ndaughter in 2015. He has not been able to reach a payment agreement with this creditor. \nApplicant intends to pay this debt after he pays off his smaller debts, using a technique \ncalled a \u201cdebt snowball.\u201d This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 33-35.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he owed $4,475 for a charged-off loan. This was in \nrelation to his second marriage in 2012. He made payments for several years but fell \nbehind because of the issues with his daughter in 2015. Applicant intends to pay this debt \nafter he pays off his smaller debts, using a technique called a \u201cdebt snowball.\u201d This debt \nis not resolved. (Tr. 35-36.) \n1.d. Applicant admitted that he owed $2,275 to a wireless telephone company for \na delinquent debt. Applicant testified that he was going to receive a bonus from work soon \nafter the hearing and would use it to pay off this debt. He made a payment arrangement \nwith the creditor and paid this debt on October 22, 2020, as shown by documentation \nfrom the creditor. This debt is resolved. (Applicant Exhibit AA; Tr. 43-45, 58-59.) \n1.e. Applicant denied that he owed $1,136 for a charged-off debt, stating he had \nbeen making agreed payments. He submitted documentary evidence showing that he \npaid this debt in full in April 2020. It has been resolved.

(Government Exhibit 4; Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 46-50.) \n1.i. Applicant denied that he owed a credit union $452 for a charged-off debt. He \nsubmitted documentary evidence showing that he paid this debt in full. It has been \nresolved. (Government Exhibit 5 at 10; Applicant Exhibits Z and BB; Tr. 52-55.) \n1.j. Applicant denied that he owed $443 for a delinquent debt. He submitted \ndocumentary evidence showing that he paid this debt in full in June 2019. It has been \nresolved. (Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 50.) \n1.k. Applicant denied that he owed a bank $293 for a delinquent debt. He submitted \ndocumentary evidence showing that he paid this debt in full in March 2019. It has been \nresolved. (Applicant Exhibit G; Tr. 57.) \n1.l. Applicant admitted owing a delinquent mobile telephone bill in the amount of \n$2,293. Applicant has not paid this debt, but stated it is next in line for payment now that \nthe debt set forth in 1.d has been resolved. This is part of his \u201cdebt snowball\u201d plan. (Tr. \n57-58.) \n1.m. Applicant denied that he owed $315 for a delinquent insurance debt. He \nsubmitted documentary evidence showing that he paid this debt in full. It has been \nresolved. (Applicant Exhibit H; Tr. 59.) \n1.n. Applicant denied that he owed $283 for a charged-off debt. He submitted \ndocumentary evidence showing that he paid this debt in full in June 2019.

Applicant admitted that he had not filed his 2016 Federal income tax return in \na timely fashion. He testified that he and his now-fianc\u00e9e had broken up after the birth of \ntheir daughter in 2016. In 2017 he moved and had emotional difficulties because of his \ndaughter\u2019s fragile health, which impacted his ability to file. Applicant has since filed this \ntax return, which indicated he was to receive a refund. He has filed all of his other tax \nreturns on a timely basis, which is confirmed by IRS documentation. (Government Exhibit \n3; Applicant Exhibit L; Tr. 60-63.) \nIn addition to the debts discussed above, Applicant submitted evidence showing \nthat he had paid off other delinquent debts before issuance of the SOR. (Government \nExhibit 5 at 8; Applicant Exhibit CC; Tr. 52-55.) \nMitigation \nApplicant provided five letters of recommendation from people who know him in \nthe defense industry, including supervisors. He is described as a man of character, a \nperson who is trustworthy, and a respected and valued contributor. They all recommend \nhim for a position of trust. (Applicant Exhibits N through R.) \nApplicant served in the Marine Corps from 2006 to 2011. He had an excellent \ncareer, as shown in various letters of commendation that he received. He received an \nHonorable Discharge at the end of his military service. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section \n15; Applicant Exhibits S through Y; Tr. 64-66.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n5 \n\n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had approximately $44,633 in past-due debts that he had not paid or \nresolved as of the time the SOR was issued. He also had not filed his 2016 Federal \nincome tax return. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has paid or otherwise resolved the majority of the debts in the SOR. As \nof the date of the hearing he had reduced his indebtedness to approximately $29,000. \nHis financial difficulties were almost entirely due to his daughter\u2019s health condition, which \nhad and continues to have a major impact on his life. Applicant\u2019s current employment has \nincreased his income, allowing him to pay his old debts in accordance with a carefully-\nthought-out plan of paying smaller debts first. His current financial status is stable, and \nhe evinces a credible intent and ability to maintain that stability into the future. \n7 \n\n \n \nApplicant has filed his 2016 Federal income tax return. He submitted evidence \nshowing that he had timely filed returns both before and after that tax year, showing it to \nbe an aberration in connection with his daughter\u2019s medical issues, and not part of a \npattern of malfeasance. This situation has no continuing security significance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payments of such debts one at a time. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). When considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view \nApplicant\u2019s corrective action to be responsible and reasonable. Given his resources, he \nhas initiated a pragmatic approach to the repayment of his SOR debts and has taken \nsignificant steps to resolve those debts. Applicant has the knowledge and ability that will \nallow him to stay on a proper financial footing. He has fully mitigated all the allegations in \nthe SOR. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial situation. He did not knowingly or voluntarily create the \ndelinquencies, and has acted responsibly to resolve them. He has minimized the potential \nfor pressure, coercion, or duress, as well as the likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the \nrecord evidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for \nnational security eligibility, and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.q: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",
